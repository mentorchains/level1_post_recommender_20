I have been refunding orders before customers complain or file any claim,"Selling on Amazon,Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns","Hey guys. So in regard to the shipping issues, and customers asking about their packages and wanting refunds; I have just sent refunds to customers when packages are weeks and still not delivered. I used all Amazon shipping, everything through Seller Central and all packages shipped and scanned at the desk by a post office rep before the Ship By dates. Not one was ever late on my end. I refunded people just as a way to get ahead of any negative hits to my account, and to be proactive with customer service. Now I am understanding that I should have some sort of protection against any of this, is that correct? Can I recoup any of my losses on product at all since I went ahead and refunded INR customer complaint emails? Or am I just stuck taking the losses, which I was already preparing to do anyway. Any advice or suggestions here would be great, even if nothing can be done now, but for learning purposes in the future. By the way, UPS has been on the ball with everything. USPS is my problem, and only reason I used them was for small First Class packages. But I am now willing to pay the extra cash for UPS no matter the package at this point. Hope the post office gets back to normal soon. Take care everyone, and Happy New Year!,No, you did not follow the correct procedure for Amazon A-Z Guarantee Buy Shipping coverage.  The buyers must file the claim, you cannot.,If customers contact you about missing packages first check the tracking on the USPS website, it has more complete information than the Amazon link on the order. If it does appear to be lost you can open a missing package claim on their site, I have had a few of those work and some that did not.,Finally if you think a package is indeed lost and you used Amazon Buy Shipping, give your customers this instruction:,To request a refund on an eligible order:,
1. Go to Your Orders.,
2. Locate your order in the list and click Problem with order.,
3. Select “Package didn’t arrive” from the list.,
4. Select Request refund.,
5. Enter your comments in the text box.,
6. Select Submit,
Note:  We may require you to first contact the seller and wait for a response for 48 hours before you are eligible to request a refund. Refund requests can take up to one week to investigate. Amazon will notify you of their decision via the email address associated with your account. To view the status of your request, locate your order in the list on the Your Orders  page and select Problem with order.,
IMPORTANT: To receive the maximum refund allowed you need to select “Package didn’t arrive”,Nope,This topic has been widely discussed here recently and is discussed in seller university.,When you click the “I agree” button then offer items for sale without actually learning the platform, you also ""agree "" to accept any losses due to ignorance.,I’m checking out Fed Ex,Thanks for responding, although you did not need to be smart about it. Was only asking a question for clarification. That is what this forum is for. Try responding with helpfulness, not making someone feel like they are inept. I am not, and would appreciate a little more respect. I already stated I was prepared for the associated losses if there was nothing to be done. This year has been unique, so wanted to make sure I did not miss anything in regard to refunding, etc. Thanks anyway. Happy New Year.,Thank you. I figured as much, just wanted to make sure with how crazy the year has been. Appreciate your time! Happy New Year!,Blunt.,Blunt is the word you meant to say.   For a topic so widely discussed, debated and discussed in seller university,  someone who ignores all that and just “starts selling” is the cause of the issue.,Get a thicker skin.   Blunt forum comments in the least of your worries.,I have been waiting for the 2nd complaint to refund.,
The first I usually respond to with the standard “your package is in transit and will arrive later than expected, TY for your patience etc etc” but if no movement by the 2nd notice I give the refund.,
Amazon is evidently asking buyers to wait until such & such date after first contact before filing claims or demanding refunds.,Yea, that is pretty much exactly the way I have been handling it. Thanks for your response."
"Amazon is telling customers to request a refund, package is lost",Selling on Amazon,"Just got back. 101.,Claims for what,Ummmmmm for packages not delivered and lost, what do you think?,ummmmm usps does not compensate for packages lost unless you get insurance on every singel package.  you get insurance on every package,is there any remedy after you appeal and lost an a to z claim even though you used amazon buy shipping and shipped on time,Ummmmm newsflash: all Priority packages come with $100 of insurance.  They have approved my two claims already.,Thanks for the post.  I am going to follow up with someone who said they received the package, but it was late.  I reminded her that I dont offer prime, and the postal system was overwhelmed due to the pandemic, and she answered back that Amazon said if it arrives late I can get my money back. It was for a party.  I havent responded.  I dont care about the money, and I was dealing with legitimate lost packages from people that were a lot kinder, and even willing to wait, although the package saw no movement for weeks.,I am willing to tell her to file a claim, just because she was rude and demanding.  She also said it was for a party, and I am curious about that party since I sell a personal care product, and its not a party item. Lol. Sounds fun!  Happy holidays forum people, thanks for the venting space.,Keep appealing, even to , if you exhaust all other appeal options. I can’t speak for all sellers, but I have never lost an appeal on cost or on metrics when I strictly follow the policies. (I have lost one appeal regarding Premium Shipping eligibility, but it was in the off season so I didn’t worry about it.),Of course, I’ve been selling online since 1999. I know all of the rules and protocol, even with all of the constant changes. Six claims were auto granted and seller funded, then when they were delivered only a few days after the granted claim I appealed, adding the PDF Proof of Delivery (WITH signature) in the buyer messages. Still lost appeals.,Why was my appeal denied?,
“We have reviewed all available information and determined you have not provided sufficient evidence to prove delivery.”,I’m not surprised…,Wait so if we use Amazon’s shipping service and buy shipping thru amazon to sell our products FBM…,
and it is still in transit…the seller requests a refund…and if they take to A-Z claims…then Amazon will refund the seller too for the lost package?,I have a package that I sent and I bought shipping thru Amazon…it is still in USPS transit…the customer got a message saying “your product could be lost you can request a refund” she messaged me. If she takes it A-Z claim…I will be refunded too?,Thanks!,Hurray, finally made it. ,That is crazy!!,You don’t both get refunded, no.,
You already got your money.,
If Amazon funds the Claim, the Buyer is refunded by Amazon directly (and you’re not charged for it.) If Amazon determines that you have to fund the Claim, they put it on “your bill.”,
We have never had a legit A-to-Z Claim denied when the tracking shows, at the very least, that the carrier took possession of the package (and we shipped through Amazon shipping.),???  Is this true?,If you buy shipping from Amazon and you shipped on time, we don’t have to issue refunds?,Whatever language that is, it seems to be his language of choice.,You will encounter it in all his posts.,I picture him pushed back in his ol’ comfy recliner, with a hazy cloud of some unidentifiable smoke wafting about…,Good to know lol,I live in and ship my packages in Aurora, IL so I definitely feel your pain!!!,Oh here’s a very understanding customer. ,  Amazon has trained this one well.,
This was also a CUSTOMIZED item.  Which are not even returnable."
"Amazon is telling customers to request a refund, package is lost",Selling on Amazon,"I did the same with expedited shipping.  I am sure I lost 10+ thousand dollars by doing so, but bet it saved me dozens or hundreds of annoying buyers.,I do not even expect Amazon to foot the “lost” package bills.  Only to make the customers wait and return anything that arrives too late for their use.,We have resorted to routing our domestic shipments through China and shipping via China Post. All seem to now be getting to customers on time , That’s basically been my approach too.,Not to , throw Amazon under the bus, but to simply be honest with buyers.,I clearly do, I am sorry you did not understand.,Not really, UPS and FedEx use the USPS all the time for last mile delivery; they all quasi compete but also work together to get packages delivered.  The bottom line is the United States does not have enough delivery capacity for certain times of the year and all 4 (Amazon now included) are needed; a failure of any one is NOT an option.,Where can I apply,
My goods keep showing that they are receiving, but they are not on the shelves,I have a product i bought 10 units of to send into fba. They were shipped out to me on 12/03/20. It showed on 12/07/20 that it was at USPS distribution center. Then on 12/11/20 it shows no time or location, just says in transit arriving late. The process has not changed since. As the buyer receiving the package do i/can i file a claim or should i contact the company i bought it from,Since you’re posting to a thread where everyone is complaining about Amazon encouraging whiny/entitled/PITA buyers to ask for a refund on packages that are NOT lost but simply delayed, due to a very understandable backlog at USPS, you should do , and just be patient and wait for your package to arrive, like every other buyer.,I won’t lie I had to email customer service many times to get help with matrix.  Most of the times you could tell it wasn’t a real person.  When I did get a real person they helped. Don’t give up, send detailed messages daily until they have no option except t help you.,I went to shipping preferences and choose the longest time available,
I eliminated the expedited shipping option all together,
Now I have that issue way less,
I still pay for 3 day shipping,
If it takes a week or two I don’t care now,
The customers get an email saying they the estimated time is 14 days,Your kidding right??? Many people don’t give full address. We don’t ship to these types of addresses but do try to get the correct info.,
Bob,
PO,
Peoria, Il,Many without legal addresses are lost or returned especially when it is an apartment complex - which get miss delivered enough- then without last name or business name it is a problem. PLUS without a legal address the postal insurance is no good. These are the reasons we contact AMAZON - I’m not sure what else you think we are contacting them for. But making the assumptions  you make means  you already have your mind made up and are not listening to anything else.  NO I don’t just sell handmade-Wrong Assumption again.,I’m just glad you are a perfect Amazon seller and have no issue with any customer addresses-you are one lucky person.,
I find it ridiculous the assumption you made about my business and customer service.,
I was advised by previous forum posters don’t waste my time here because there are a few people that always and only pick apart everything you say and try to make you look like your making it up or your a bad seller.,
Good try–I choose to be connected with others who are not needing to be critical of everyone else and know what supportive is. I’m sorry to tell you but you do not know everything about everything just like the rest of us. But trying to make other sellers look/feel bad on the forums is pretty tacky and far from what the forums should be used for. That only chases people away from the forums-but maybe that is your objective.,I didn’t know that we could actually call seller support…what is the number?,I feel all your pain! I am in the same boat. Now I have one or two nut jobs reaching out on my Facebook page saying, “I have Amazon Prime, this should have been here in a day or two after I ordered it”. Amazon has created a nightmare of a monster with no ability to control the business they and us rely on. It amazes me how much education I have to do to each and everyone of the buyers who email saying “my package never arrived, I want a refund”. I ask them - have you tracked your package on USPS to see where it is? That usually helps a bit.,I never said I called them.  I opened a case.  Online.   But there was an option to have them call you instead of email.  But I’m not a phone person, so email it was.,As a buyer and a seller, I feel that the seller should always be the one to file a claim.  But you could try it.,No, I’m not kidding. And rarely are my customer shipping addresses incomplete. I’ve been doing this 15 years, do a reasonable amount of business, all seller-fulfilled, and never , have I needed to contact Amazon about a shipping address problem.,I’m not a perfect seller, but I don’t think most of us have issues with customer addresses. Most buyers enter their shipping address once into Amazon’s system and then click to ‘ship to this saved address’ each time they place an order. If an address is invalid, it’s going to be caught and fixed right away. Your story that you have this problem repeatedly doesn’t make any sense.,I don’t have a problem with apartment deliveries either.,As I said above, I’ve never needed to contact Amazon for an issue like that. Do you wonder why you need to do it regularly, and the rest of us don’t?,No, it means I’m capable of putting together the things you say and drawing conclusions from them.,If you recall - you’re the one having issues and complaining how you need Amazon’s help. I offered you some guidance, because I’m NOT having the issues you are, and I DON’T need Amazon’s help to take care of the customers who’s packages haven’t arrived.,Well I’m so glad you don’t have any issues - that is just amazing - you are so very lucky. Your conclusions/guidance are nothing more than criticism, judgement and seller blame. To bad the forums have this kind of input–they could be a place of support and actual information. But having someone twist and turn every word to only offer negative criticism and insulting insinuations is no help to anyone. I really hope for the sake of new people coming here for help they don’t get any of your GUIDANCE!!,You’re foolish if you think so, but I guess you’ve got some silly excuse for why the 100 likes my response to you got means my advice is meaningless, unhelpful, and nothing more than criticism.,Well, they were for the 100 or so users who liked my response. Funny that it’s , that doesn’t see that.,But hey, it’s Christmas, so I’ll leave you with this advice. Open your mind and accept it if it has any merit, or reject it as you see fit., can help yourself and your business better than anyone else can, including Amazon. My initial response to you was not meant to criticize, but to help you open your eyes to that fact. If you view , as the entity most empowered to control your fate on Amazon, you’ll have a lot less problems and a lot more success.,Seller support also stated to us “do not refund until the goods are returned” but the customers are demanding the refund even before USPS delivers it to them. We have a few hundred that this happened to and not sure how to address this situation as the bad feedback is starting to come in.,Help AMAZON and put out something to 3rd party sellers and the World stating the carriers are at fault and not the 3rd party reliable sellers that had the packages to the carrier in time to deliver.,If you used Buy Shipping, neg feedback for shipping related complaints are struck-through and amazon notes that the delivery issues with this order were mot the fault of the seller.,That may be all the support amazon provides for this issue."
"Amazon is telling customers to request a refund, package is lost",Selling on Amazon,"UPS and FedEx are also struggling to make deliveries on time. They stopped taking deliveries for some retailers and have routed packages through the USPS (which has further strained the postal service). The USPS is clearly hurting the most though and for a multitude of reasons.,Your comments suggest you aren’t exactly following what’s going on so I’ll leave off with this: Your isolated experience does not represent what is happening larger scale. Respectfully, please do some reading and you may gain a better understanding.,Did you file USPS claims?,My UPS packages have only been delayed a day or two at best, if they are delayed at all.,I would file claims but I just don’t have the time right now. I am already miserable and I have to put on a Christmas smile and be a good dad so my ruined Christmas doesn’t ruin my kids’ Christmas. 2021 is a time for change. I am so far past done with this business it is not even funny.,This is not my experience. UPS is delivering in 1 day to our normal 1 day zone, 2 days to 2 day zones, etc.,What really makes my blood boil is our local USPS post office branches will be delivering Priority Mail packages and Amazon packages on Christmas Day. Meanwhile many small businesses that shipped their own items FCM get the shaft. This is part of the reason why USPS should not be permitted to enter into a NSA (Negotiated Service Agreement) that stiffs small businesses.,My personal experience with UPS has also not been bad. My point is that during this unprecedented time, all carriers are experiencing issues. Some more than others. The USPS is taking the brunt of the hit for a variety of reasons.,Maybe, the United States Postal Service should get out of the commercial carrier business and stick to first class letters. Leave the cartage of parcels to the professionals.,Yes, that is what UPS and FedEx have been saying for decades, with one caveat, don’t require us to handle the rural deliveries as they are not profitable.,
It is the same thing the Airlines tried to do when we deregulated the airline industry. If we are going to do that, I say we just let the Post Office not go to places that are not profitable like the regular carriers would. That way those of us in cites are not subsidizing rural routes with our postage fees. (Sarcasm),Funny, UPS adds a rural surcharge to remote locations, to a few of my shipments. In one instance it doubled the cost.,I get that rural might not be profitable, I also know that individuals in extremely remote areas have options such as setting up private boxes at the local tavern, co-op, gas station, etc. (which some already do). The Postal Service doesn’t even provide front door delivery to some rural areas right now.,The less than 1% of the population that this would affect will just need to work around it, like they already do for many other things like running water, and electricity. There are advantages and disadvantages from having your nearest neighbor 10 miles, and the closest grocer 75 miles away from your house.,It is WAY more than 1% when looking at profitability, or UPS and FedEx would not rely so much on their Last Mile services for rural areas.,
Lets not forget, the trucks would still have to go there for letter service.,To be fair Last Mile service will always be more economical for UPS and FedEx because the Federal Government has an unfair competitive advantage. USPS doesn’t pay income tax, right there at least 16% to 45% increase in operating costs. The Federal Government also doesn’t pay Road Use tax on fuel, this makes every gallon of fuel $0.244 cheaper (not including state fuel taxes) or 11% reduction in fuel costs. Which equates at eight miles to the gallon a competitive advantage of $3.05 per 100 miles just in fuel expenditures alone.,I have no issue with exempting carriers from State and Federal Highway Use (fuel) taxes, in exchange for USPS downsizing to exclusively first-class letter service. Huge bonus no more bulk mail rate (i.e. junk mail).,Not everything is or should be a competition. Some things are done for public good, not profits.,I have issues. There is no reason UPS should be subsidized in the form of fuel tax reductions, while the same cement mixer next to it on the road has to pay the tax for the use of the roads. It’s not like they are just going to be carrying mail parcels, so then we would be subsidizing the other shipments with no gas taxes. The roads (and associated taxes) are for the common good, interstate commerce and national defense, the post office serves the same purposes. UPS exists to make a profit, not serve the interests of Americans. When the leaders or elected representatives can remove the CEO of a private corporation, like they can the board of governors, or postmaster general I will reconsider.,Remember that email we all got recently, where Amazon is thanking us for working so hard and how much they love us?  While someone at corporate was writing that, all the small and medium sellers they glorified are being thrown under a street roller by Amazon.  A-Z claims instantly being granted, appeals never work.  Ya, we mean so much to you Amazon -_-,If USPS goes under and operates horribly, UPS and FedEx stand to make billions.  They would never help them.,I don’t mind returns as well, since most customers will keep it.  What I do have a problem with is Amazon instantly granting A-Z claims on packages still in transit and are CLEARLY not lost.  Now the customers are going to try to keep the products and their money, through no fault of our own.,I agree - I believe it’s against the law to keep both the item and a refund.,I’m waiting really shocked that Amazon hasn’t made an announcement regarding how to handle these - however if Amazon is refunding the A-Z Claims and funding them we are not out anything. I think Amazon would rather the customer gets to keep the item then return it to the seller if it is coming out of Amazons pocket.,I have been selling on Amazon for 18 years and usually they are pretty quick, well within a few days to update us on how we should be handling all of this. I just assume that if we are overwhelmed - I believe Amazon is feeling it 100x’s worst. I’m sure they will put a notice new alert out soon (I can only hope).,The issue is, they are funding it from our pockets, not theirs.  As well, it would take 0.01% of their workforce 5 minutes to 1. Update us on how they and we should be handling this, and 2. Notify customers of the ongoing NATIONAL and INTERNATIONAL issues instead of telling them to ask for refunds.,It is completely unacceptable.  We have all been well aware that this was happening for almost 3 weeks now.  If it takes 3 weeks into a 4 week mass carrier delay to even give any kind of announcement to sellers or buyers… something else is wrong.  They obviously choose to push this onto us to deal with both financially and emotionally with THEIR customers instead of making the simple and easy decision to educate buyers on the current issues and how they may be affecting orders.,Literally… super easy…  not asking much at all… that is really all I wanted from them… and we did not get it and it’s almost too late to make any difference as packages are bound to all make it through by next week as the shopping virtually stops this week.,My local PO picks up and scans the sheet. Doesn’t count as “shipped” until it hits the Pittsburgh center. In any other time, there is no real delay. However, due to the pandemic, combined with the time of year, there can be 2-3 days of lag, especially over a weekend, between when they are picked up and Amazon actually classifies them as “shipped”. Using that as way to justify reimbursing the buyer from the sellers pockets is not right.,There is no excuse for Amazon to not make adjustments due to the issue at hand. Especially when they continue to promote Priority Mail as a valid shipping option, even for SFP Two Day Shipping. Are you kidding me !?!?!,Thankfully the story is picking up steam and I feel sellers will be made whole. I already stopped using Priority Mail 10 days ago, paying an extra $1-$5 per shipment to avoid “Where’s My Stuff”. Yet Amazon continues to promote Priority Mail for SFP Two Day orders.,We are already paying extra to satisfy the buyers. Yet Amazon says nothing. No excuse.,The system does NOT block ,. Customers can NOT opt out of getting replies to their questions. They can only opt out of ,.,I don’t know what you sell obviously, but there should not be any need to contact customers in order to fulfill their orders. All the ‘info they need for the item they purchased’ should be available on the product page for the buyer’s review , placing their order. Unless, possibly, you’re in handmade where items are customized for individual buyers.,I don’t sell in that area so can’t speak to how Amazon handles it, but you haven’t given any indication I recall that you are a handmade seller. For other items, an Amazon purchase should be a hands-off transaction, there should be no need to contact a buyer at all.,Of course I realize that what works for one person may not work for another. But what , is wringing your hands, complaining that Amazon needs to take action, and doing nothing yourself.,There’s a lot that’s wrong about Amazon (a LOT!) but many times you can mitigate the impact of Amazon’s failures through your own customer service.,That’s a big difference between us, apparently. I almost , contact Amazon.,When buyer’s message us that Amazon says the package is lost and can be refunded, this is part of what I’ve told them:,In each and every case, I do my best to throw Amazon further under the bus then they are doing to us. IMO, it’s clear Amazon is not telling buyers the truth to avoid having to payout on A-Z claims under their Buy Shipping policy. Regardless, I’m finding most buyers to be patient and understanding. I also direct them to the USPS tracking link since Amazon lags behind in tracking events and fails to provide detailed information.,The last buyer that sent me the “Amazon told me it’s lost” message was two days ago. His package was delivered today. Not so lost now is it? The buyer before that sent the “it’s lost/refund me now” message three days ago and picked up his package yesterday.,Never miss an opportunity to politely inform buyers Amazon is full of poo poo…"
"Amazon is telling customers to request a refund, package is lost",Selling on Amazon,"They are denying the claims, using the excuse that the package was SHIPPED LATE (because USPS is not scanning) or using any excuse they can find.  I have had 15 claims, all shipped on time. It’s obvious when packages leave PA and the first scan 10 days later is in FLORIDA, that we didn’t ship the package late, from Florida.  So they are denying all the claims.  I am now refunding just to stop the bleed against my ODR, which is outrageous.,USPS deserves to be dissolved after all of this. The financial loss many of us will take here is beyond what should be expected.,We are well beyond that, with another 15 A to Z’s that were granted, all amazon shipping.  Because the initial scans are somewhere not even near where we are located, they are saying they shipped late, they did not.  I am guessing that’s the answer we are going to see and most claims held against the seller.,YES.  That’s their new reason to grant the A to Z and hold it against the seller.,
Everything was not shipped on time.,
Yeah it was.,
USPS is not SCANNING on time.,
The few we are shipping now (small first class under $15) we are making the driver scan in front of us.  We told USPS we will only give these packages to a carrier who can scan at pick up - previously we were picked up by a large USPS box truck and taken directly to the distribution cnter, so often scans weren’t seen for days.  This was never an issue because packages arrived on time so the initial scan never mattered).  So now the carrier is ready to bust his buttons because he’s not happy  but we get the initial scan.  And then we see nothing else.  FOR DAYS.  So once again they have an excuse.  They will tell us it was shipped late or not at all which is NOT TRUE.  UPS has never been a problem…,Not only is Amazon hurting their sellers, they are further burdening the system that is struggling. This needs to be addressed by Amazon, Walmart, and other marketplaces NOW. Temporarily shield the sellers and let customers know it’s an issue with the transit process- which sellers have 0 control over.,You clearly don’t understand that this is happening to every order, not just orders delivered by Amazon. I can show you 30 examples from my own customers in the last week, or a few from my personal Amazon experience if you’d like?,That’s what I’m doing, and so far it’s worked with most people.  But you’re always going to get those hateful, angry people.  God will deal with them.,Not too long ago, there was some discussion on this forum regarding Sellers and if it was necessary to insist on having USPS employees scan parcels (or the scan sheet) immediately. Many claimed that it wasn’t necessary and anyone that would waste the time and aggravate the Postal Service employees by insisting that the scan(s) happen at the time of pick-up/drop-off and in their presence, was just being stupid and/or nasty.,Anyone else recall that? In light of recent events, we can all agree that Sellers should always insist on seeing their parcels (or scan sheet) scanned at the time of pick-up or drop-off.,We’re a little over a grand for refunds we had to give ourselves due to USPS failing to scan. About 55$ for incorrectly granted A-to-Z’s (which we’re appealing).  Of course, that number could absolutely swing another few thousand if our late November shipments haven’t really been combed yet by the people who were supposed to get them.  Having looked at the number of items showing no scan at all for the first week of December (yes, with scan sheets) I’m counting our lucky stars that we haven’t lost money this holiday season. We haven’t MADE enough money to make this stress-inducing nightmare worth it, but so far we aren’t going backwards.,Of course, Amazon is going to be out ALL of our money soon, so hopefully it was worth it to them to ignore us thousands of little guys and then fail to follow their own policies when called on it. Can’t wait for the stories next year: ‘Amazon appears to be almost entirely scammers now’ or ‘Think you ordered that medicine from a legitimate company? Think again.’  All because they forced the sellers who do things right to go look for a partner that will hold up their end of the bargain.,You guys - start filing for your USPS claims.  They are approving them rather quickly.,This is not the postal workers’ faults nor the pandemic or the ecommerce spike. This is the highest level of incompetence at their management level. I will NOT be using the post office next Christmas. We dropped off over 20 tubs of mail a day at the local post office at their loading docks and come to find out they didn’t scan some of the sheets so now customers think I just printed a label and didn’t even ship the items. On top of that they tell customers when they do scan the sheets that they received the shipment but maybe not the package so again customers think I am a liar and a thief. What should have been the best Christmas with record sales is turning into a nightmare. I would call 911 if I thought it would do any good. At this point I don’t even care about the money anymore I just want it to be over.,We are demanding the carrier scan in front of us and they are refusing.  We are now giving them less than 10 packages a day down from over 100.  They told us it takes the carrier too much time, they will be scanned at the distribution center - which would be fine in the case that scan happens within 48 hours.  And it’s not.,we’ve moved mostly everything to UPS, the smaller packages under 1 pound is what we are giving them, less than $200 a day.  More than we care to lose, but not much else we can do .  If we take them to our post office, they have an area where you leave pre posted packages, and they “claim” they scan them at the end of the day.  That’s our best option.,This is the new excuse of choice to pay out A to Z claims and hold the seller accountable.  15 claims, ALL DELIVERED right after they received payment - we are appealing them all.  Understanding the “reviewers” are very young people not in the USA, I am wondering if they have any idea what is happening here?  WE appeal, they deny, always the same reason "" you didn’t ship on time"".  Yes we did.  Exhausting.,Not every issue is the sellers fault. If you read my post I can’t even get buyers address correction when I need them. NO I did not over use that privilege. I respond to EVERY customer email - I have never ignored any email. Your lucky you had only a few inquires. I have been getting 20 or more every day for well over a week. Many orders I shipped Dec 2nd were just delivered Friday so I don’t blame them for asking as I would. But Amazon is Blocking many many emails as I’ve called numerous times over the address issues after not getting a customer response and I’m told they have opted out. That is even with the first email.,
Things may vary with how many items you sell/ship - what works for you many not be working for someone else-believe me I’ve spent hours contacting Amazon for info regarding orders or customer confusion and am unable to get them info they need for the item they purchased. Amazon also tells me they can NOT email the customer since they opted out.,Luckily most customers have been understanding but for some not to know what is going on at the post office hubs nationwide means they are living under a rock. It has been all over the news. The Rochester, NY hub has hundreds of trailers of unsorted mail sitting outside of their hub with no space to move them in and no workers to sort them. They couldn’t even get enough seasonal help because Americans are too lazy to give up their unemployment and do hard work. They have been offering all the carriers and clerks overtime to come into the sorting centers to help (told to me by a clerk) I should make the idiots at the post office scan each and every package in the 20 tubs individually or tell them I will file a complaint with the Post Master if they don’t… At least then customers would know where to place the blame.,Perhaps you can make the argument that management in that particular facility should take accountability of your packages not being scanned.,But what is happening right now is absolutely the fault of the pandemic and surge of online purchases, along with what the postmaster general did to the system.,Had we done that back in November we would not be in the situation we feel we are in right now.,
We were picked up by one of those “tractor trailers” every day for the past 3 years.  We have never had an issue, scans or not, because just about everything arrived on time.  Now the “no scan” issue is becoming an ISSUE because the A to Z’s are being gratned immediately telling us we didn’t ship the package for 2 weeks.  ,Yesterday when the carrier refused to scan we sent an employee to the local office at the end of the day and he was told to “leave them over there in the open window”, and they would scan them at the end of the day.  He went in and out with 3 at a time and made sure each one was scanned.  It’s insane that it has come to this and I’m really shocked that Amazon is using THIS EXCUSE to pay these claims, well knowing these items left on time and many will at some point deliver.,
5 that we are appealing were delivered the day after the claim was granted.  Makes me wonder about a lot fo these buyers too…seeing delivery is imminent, files the claim, gets the money, package delivers…we all know the rest.,If that was the case UPS, Fed Ex and Amazon would have the same issues. I have had zero problems getting their packages on time or early. UPS Ground from PA to NY. One day through December. PA to NY media mail? Three weeks nothing sitting in a hub. The post office blaming the pandemic and ecommerce sales is bs.,Amazon will never acknowledge the problem. We are dirt to them. In their perfect universe every seller uses FBA on their site and every other seller is gone. Make no mistake that is their master plan. I would bet my life on it.,I’m not shocked at all. I bet there are still many sellers with settings of 1 day handling time and 2-4 day transit time. Amazon’s exposure would be into the many, many millions if they were to cover all the claims. I fully expected Amazon to use the narrowest and most restrictive interpretation of their Buy Shipping policy. I did refund some orders, but I quickly changed my handling time to 10 days and maxed out transit time to 5-8 days. No packages were to leave our possession/presence without being scanned either at our warehouse or at a PO. Not feeling that would be enough, I just set all inventory to 0 on Amazon and will ride this one out.,Those considering arbitration, make sure you fine folks take screenshots of Amazon’s transit time settings. Because in this environment, the max Amazon permits is too low IMO, influences buyer expectations and increases the likelihood of A-Z claims making Amazon culpable.,I have some from NOVEMBER stuck at regional hubs, mostly Orlando. My letter carrier told me the backlog there is of nightmarish proportions."
"Amazon is telling customers to request a refund, package is lost",Selling on Amazon,"there not even accepting scanned packages .  there saying you have to ship in a timely matter so you can forget about the amazon by shipping policy,not true.  I just had a case and it was appealed and I lost even though amazon buy shipping was used and the item shows accepted.  they replied back saying you have to ship in a timely matter.  the item was shipped on the 7th same day* ordered,AMAZON is just to big to powerful.,
They do not care for anyone of us at all not one little bit. You can be a huge seller on Amazon but they have so many now they could not give a hoot if they loose you…,
They could have helped this situation before it began. They saw this issue coming long ago. See articles in the Washington Post(which they own) months ago stating this is going to be an issue…,In the end we all have drunk the cool aid. It’s to late Amazon is king and we all must bow…,This Christmas delema,  for small mom and pop stores is going to hurt them or maybe even bankrupt them in the worst time with this second wave of the pandemic hitting…,Well done well played Amazon you reign supreme…,
All hail Amazon, hail hail…,
Now bow…,Thanks.  All of our shipping is purchased through amazon shipping services.,And it’s not just Amazon. I filed a missing mail report with USPS for an item I shipped on December 04, which had no tracking events since its initial tracking at my PO.,I was shocked to receive the following reply only hours later:,This is the USPS declaring a package lost after less than three weeks! I wonder if they would be so quick if the package was insured. (It wasn’t.),BTW: A few days later there was a subsequent tracking event. Still not close to my buyer, but at least it’s not lost.,Look at your policy information and make an adjustment there along with handling times.  This will give customers everything they need and Amazon no room to back out.  check out our company policy page as an example.  It is working for us.  We change handling times based on reserve account releases almost daily to ensure people get the items when expected, adn explain holiday delays.  We also confirm with them when we receive an order.  Most everyone appreciates the follow up email explaining the handling times and the delays.  We do receive fewer orders but customers are much more delighted.  I hope this helps someone.,It appears the infectious disease that causes USPS packages to be incorrectly scanned, has reached UPS. I never thought I would have customs clearance to go 40 miles in the same state. LOL,
It must be all the union employees and their oversized paychecks! Harumph Harumph Harumph… LOL,I was told my question was dumb and how I should send a note to buyers-Don’t he think we would if we could?? There is no way to add a note to the email that Amazon sends out for a purchase. I use to always do this with eBay when there was a holiday or any thing that could effect a delivery. As far as I know there is no way in Amazon unless you email every customer. Is there something I have missed? Sending individual email is a waste of time as I really think most are blocked-I can’t even get responses to needing address info.,For me it seems like my Priority Flat Rate envelopes are taking the longest!  Then first class, then my Priority packages.,If you file a clam with the USPS you can add your postage to your claim.  I have won all 5 of my claims (in previous years) that I filed and added on the postage.  Right now have a few claims I just put in yesterday and the day before, they are still “under review”.  I feel like the USPS really needs to be held accountable for this disaster.,The thought police will not appreciate the file name of your uploaded image.,However, it made me laugh.,Ya, gee thanks for pointing it out.,So check this out.  This order I shipped 3 DAYS AGO is scheduled to be delivered tomorrow.  (I’ll be keeping an eye on this one to see if it actually happens…),I spoke to my mail carrier today and she said the distribution centers are getting the new packages shipped right out and leaving the ones that have been there for weeks.   So instead of first-in, first-out, it’s last-in, first out.   Makes sense right? ,It makes sense. Waste of labor and time touching everything multiple times due to geographic location. Can’t rake leaves from the bottom of the pile first.,Ok, so maybe that makes sense… but it’s not fair to the people who have been waiting weeks for their packages.,Triage is not fairness, it’s survival.,How much have people had to refund so far.,
We are at $2505.92 so far and going up daily.,
This will probably bankruptcy us.,$12 - and that was for a single A-Z claim that I’m going to appeal on the basis of using Amazon’s Buy Shipping.,What I , was that you should , to the customer inquiries about being refunded for a late package, thanks to Amazon’s misguided note.,Of the few inquiries I’ve had, only one ultimately went on to file an A-Z claim for item not received. The messages I sent , the need for refunds on all others.,If you do not have the ability to contact customers, perhaps it’s because you misused it when you did have it. I can contact customers if I want to. I don’t usually need to, and I wouldn’t suggest that sellers pester all customers pro-actively with an unnecessary message. If a buyer is concerned about their package and reaches out to you to ask about it, , you send them a message such as I recommended and by providing this little bit of customer service, you can AVOID (or at least minimize)  the disastrous consequences that people here are so worried about.,only if it was “delivered” otherwise your on the hook unfortunately"
"Amazon is telling customers to request a refund, package is lost",Selling on Amazon,"I received two decisions where Amazon covered the AtoZ claim and a third where they denied it even though I used buy shipping and shipped the next day (ordered on a Sunday, shipped on a Monday as per the USPS tracker). I have appealed.,This customer ordered 4 days ago, it shipped 3 days ago.  ,  I just can’t with this anymore.,Since the USPS is saying these orders are not lost, just delayed, can we simply tell the customers that when the order arrives they can request a refund and return the item?,I’m sure it will result in some negative reviews and frustration, but at least all these orders won’t have been shipped for free.,New announcement for FBA…and my response:,Disgraceful. We are small businesses. We do not have a trillion dollars in the bank.,Amazon does. So maybe they should foot the bill for an issue they are well aware of and understand we have ZERO control over… .,Not true at all.  If you use Amazon’s “buy shipping” you are covered if the item is lost or the customer claims they never received it.,In theory, “in theory” and “in practice” are the same thing. In practice, they are not.,I think you missed much of this thread, but there are certainly sellers experiencing something different. Just as there are A2Z cases awarded without buyers following the rules for contacting sellers first, changes to the returns policy aside from the oft-repeated “the only change is we’re taking away restock fees”, etc. etc. etc. You can’t even quote Amazon’s documentation or the TOS to support and have them follow it.,Bezos is not the richest man in the world, he is the richest man in the world with publicly disclosed assets which can be calculated. Several oligarchs, sheiks, dictators, and underworld figures are probably wealthier. Aditionally, Bezos doesn’t even come close to the wealth of numerous historical figures including American industrialist Rockefeller. Some other historical figures with astronomical wealth which exceed Mr. Bezos are Jakob Fugger, Musa I of Mali, John of Gaunt, William the Conqueror, Augustus (estimated to exceed $4.6 Trillion, he personally owned all of Egypt). Even Nicholas II was probably wealthier than Jeff Bezos prior to his basement execution by the Bolsheviks in 1918.,You are so right!! And it can be the dumbest stuff–impossible to get problems taken care of.,Amazon just told one of my customers that they are asking too early for a DVD I mailed out on December 3…today is December 22…Mailed First Class:,Personally, I ordered a Blu-ray that was shipped first class on December 9…still not here.  Seems first class is taking between 15 - 20 days…,Of course I would have sent them an email if there was an option!!  I have enough trouble getting emails to customers to ask about address issues. So many emails are blocked by Amazon. When I called Amazon and asked if I could to this they even said if did I would no longer be able to sell. So sounds like a easy answer but things are not as easy done as said.,How can we recover what we have spent on shipping?  USPS didnt come through on delivery.  i have lost thousands on shipping fees since Amazon is allowing refunds.  The merchandise will arrive eventually and then we will be out inventory like we just gave it away for free!,I have physically dropped off packages last Thursday, Friday, Saturday, even Sunday in the local drop box at our post office.,Some have moved and have been delivered.  Some haven’t even been scanned in yet!  Some show received by carrier.,This is a disaster.  All shipping purchased through Amazon.,I asked seller support what to do in the case where the buyer asked for refund because they haven’t received the item yet (this was 5 days ago, package has now been delivered)  Here is what they wrote back:,
,
,
,Yes, My Dec 2nd orders have started being delivered Friday…so they are just a bit behind.,To avoid the disaster you speak of, stand in line and get the packages scanned or ask your carrier to scan them in your presence.,They left out the best option:  Instruct the customer to file an AZ claim for not received, assuming you purchased shipping through Amazon.  Amazon funds refunds with delvery issues when shipping is purchased through the site…,Amazon often doesn’t follow its own polices, as many of their reps don’t even KNOW all their policies.  If you dont get satisfaction from their own policy enforcement, you have to appeal.,No way to recover any postage. I have people who ordered Priority Mail on Dec 2nd…It was delivered Friday so now they want a refund the the extra they paid in postage. Post office is NOT covering any of this and Amazon will not help you at all. Sorry but your just out of like the rest of us.,
Yep, most people will not return those late deliveries or send payment-we are just going to be giving those items away. Someone said send the buyers a note. You would have to do that individually which would take me days-and Amazon will suspend you if they find you send emails like that. It’s crazy but to be expected since we are selling on Amazon. They do pretty stupid stuff but that email was one of the dumbest ever. But if you look at them sending it to cover their butt–and lower the calls they were getting about late orders it makes perfect sense-don’t expect any different they are not there to help us.,I have packages that were never scanned in because the clerks are just stacking up piles of items and loading them directly on the trucks, sending them to sorting centers where they are put into another pile. How is Amazon handling A to Z claims where no scan was made by the receiving post office? Because of our numbers we unload our packages at the back door directly into a cart.,This is such a joke that amazon is not following there own policies.  A to z is now saying usps never received the package and to ship in a timely matter when the item clearly shows accepted by usps."
"Amazon is telling customers to request a refund, package is lost",Selling on Amazon,"This pretty much says it all.  They can get away with really doing this at any time.  Now, their A-to-Z “policy” states that customers can request a refund when “You have not received your package and three days have passed since the maximum estimated delivery date”.  They could change that policy to any time frame they choose and we’d be on the hook for those payments because of the TOS we agreed to.,That said, the Buy Shipping we pay for should cover people in those instances where they fulfilled their end of the deal.,Again, this all has to do with “shipments”, not deliveries…  Here is the definition of “shipment” from the FTC on that page:,(e)  ,  shall mean the act by which the merchandise is physically placed in the possession of the carrier.,What makes it worse is the Jeff Bezos is not only the richest man in the world, many consider him to be the richest person who has ever lived.,Thanks for an actual quote. I read this as “we can give away all of your money without limitation, beyond even your gross receipts,” which sounds like a bad agreement to enter into. Is there anything there that prevents Amazon from refunding every customer 125% of their purchase amount, even for delivered goods?,In spite of that, agreeing to the , per se is agreeing to the whole process, e.g. Amazon is often granting A2Zs without the customer meeting their obligations to contact sellers first (n/a here, but still), or refunding prior to the item being the requisite 30 days late (or immediately, with notification it’s to be late, or past the promised delivery deadline). I don’t think there’s a single seller who’s been here for a while that can’t show a case where they quoted to Amazon the policy that Amazon was ignoring/violating, and still got no joy (e.g. the folks here who are using Amazon shipping and not seeing their claims being covered).,Well there are always the boundaries of gross negligence. I have a hard time imaging it is possible to boilerplate one self or entity from all legal repercussions. What I do not know is where that line is drawn.,I have also yet to read about a seller who has gone through the (also agreed to) arbitration process to address some of these issues and the cost and result. I doubt many sellers here are going to pay out for the process with representation (you know Amazon will) in order to effectively make a claim.,valerie…how did you get that email? I just got 4 claims just today with lots of orders undelivered. Im thinking my business is destroyed after 8 years here, perfect metrics.,I opened a case yesterday and even though they responded yesterday (without really answering my questions) today I just received that message from my case.,The “I” in “AI” here stands for insanity, not intelligence.  I see no evidence of any intelligence, but there’s certainly no shortage of malevolence.,This is only one of quite a few different threads that have gone into the hundreds of replies, all with similar issues, without a single Amazon response.,Amazon has made it very clear this holiday that it does not care about its sellers. I think we should all be keeping that in mind when we make our decisions on who to partner with going forward.,Here a million dollar question that I wonder if someone might know the answer to.  When Amazon finally shows the message that the package might be lost, does their tracking systems stop checking on it from that point forward?  I would be concerned that when the packages are eventually delivered and receiving delivery confirmation scans, Amazon won’t bother to notify the customer that their order has been delivered.  I guess a nice “Opps, we goofed! Your package was never lost after all and has just been delivered!” would be nice.  Wishful thinking?,That’s one heck of an understanding customer you had there.  Very far and few between unfortunately.,We tell clowns that we are out of stock, when they ask for a replacement. Even when we show more for sale on Amazon LOL.,Lol. I tell them, it will only arrive after the original item does, so no point in sending a replacement. Or at least I did for a few customers I couldn’t sooth.,Any sufficiently advanced incompetence is indistinguishable from malice.,At the risk of opening a can of worms, I refer to this as a “Bush/Cheney” problem … from outside of the black box, there’s no way to tell if most of Amazon’s actions are gross incompetence, evil genius, or systemic overload that can only address the fires that most immediately impact Amazon (leaving the ones that affect 3PS at the bottom of a never-ending To Do List). The first two are probably insolvable, and the last one could only be addressed by Amazon slowing their roll, and not onboarding sellers, growing market share, and instituting change at such an overwhelming (to Amazon) pace. So, we’re basically SOL. But it was fun, um, I mean profitable, um, I mean, , while it lasted.,I know, right.  They are coming in in droves.  How in the heck can Amazon even justify this.  This should be the post office’s responsibility.,ditto.  I would say Wal-Mart.  They treat sellers way better than Amazon does.  This is just ridiculous.,I definitely feel that Amazon is setting itself up for this, and they need to be betrrr to their sellers or they will fall hard into a class action.,Yes it is a nightmare. I have been staying up late sleeping only 4 hours each night working and taking care of my disabled husband. Trying to get ahead after evacuating a couple months ago due to wildfire. I can’t believe people don’t care and keep asking for refunds, I told them it isn’t my fault and they can see the tracking shows the item is already close to their location but they know they can get free stuff because amazon said. I told them to return the item and I will refund but they said they wanted the refund now!!! Of course they know they will get the item and steal.,I posted a bicycle and immediately got hit with coyright.  The distributor simply took a manufacturers product and listed it as their own using stock images, and stock descriptions, stock everything.  basically saying this is not really our product but we are going to put our name on here to mislead people.  Then file a complaint against anyone who does deal with the factory.  Not a huge deal we can get it removed.,WHY DOES AMAZON MAKE IT SO EASY FOR PEOPLE TO NAIL SELLERS, AND IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO PROVE THEIR CASE.,ANSWER:  THEY HAVE TOO MUCH TO GAIN BY OFFERING GIFT CARDS, OR ALTERNATIVE OTHER CHOICES THAT LEAD TO AMAZON SALES…   JUST MY OPINION.  I HATE FIGHTING FOR WHAT IS RIGHT.  HONEST SELLERS TAKE IT IN THE YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN COMPETING WITH PEOPLE WHO BLATANTLY STEAL FROM YOU OR HARM YOUR BUSINESS."

Tell them you will put a trace on the package and if USPS cant find it you will refund them.,All what you get from Amazon is computer generated email. Good Luck,It’s because USPS is literally skipping those intermediary scans to save time.  At least you have an acceptance and delivery scan.  I’m a very low-volume seller and have at least one package that was picked up a week ago and has no scan whatsoever (still in pre-shipment, “awaiting package”).  When the pandemic first hit, I had a few like that which never got the first scan, then finally showed departing a local distribution center 10-14 days later.,Yeah love Amazons covering us, they are denying appeals after they give your money away.

Amazon wake up, you help create this problem as we shipped with the security of you promised protection against just something like this!,I had already received a reply yesterday and thought that was the end of it.  This person responded to my case again today.  I don’t think it’s just a computer generated email, but even if it is, they have to do what they say they will do.,Same problem here. Amazon reps are telling them to ask for refund.  And yes if they file an a to z , you will loose and have to file an appeal and usually you will win that.

They stated that because of the recent increase in many of their employees calling out sick due to the COVID 19 Virus, they are short staffed and overwhelmed. They also advised that due to some state and local closures that it has been very difficult for their delivery drivers to deliver packages to state sorting Facilities across the country.

The customer got their money and a day later got the product and I have nothing…  the customer didn’t even give it a chance before filing the claim- all kinds of wrong.,
Lori,To get some actual data, I went ahead and filed – as a , – for a refund for an order that was running late (sorry to the FBA sellers impacted). I originally tried this yesterday, when the order had a big “ask for your money now” button, but clicking that told me I had to wait 3 days from the promised delivery date. Amazon did inform me by email that the item was running late, which I interpret as triggering the FTC mandate that a refund be made available (but in NO WAY do I read anything on the FTC site as indicating that the final outcome should be buyer ends up with money , product). As a seller, I’d like to have control over that messaging, as well as maximum promised delivery date, but there’s a lot I’d like as a seller that I’m never gonna get (and a lot of the little I have now that will eventually be taken away from me).,In the follow-up message Amazon sent me, there is this semi-ambiguous gem:,
,I’m sure some lawyer wannabe is going to point out that this could narrowly be interpreted to mean anything, but I read it as “Amazon expects you, the buyer, to return the item if you got refunded for it.”,I’d still like to see something in writing on Amazon that says we agree to let Amazon decide if/when to refund and/or message in this scenario, but I think this gives some backing to contacting these customers and demanding the product back. If you believe it does something, you could probably report the buyer for failing to follow this instructions.,I would suggest messaging the customer at least once before delivery scan, so you have their anonymized email address to interact with them later.,I’ve been on Amazon for over 5 years now and I’ve never lost an A-Z claim, so I’m hopeful that it will work out.,The law is encompassing and material delay is a grounds for rejection, i.e refund upon request, regardless of actual delivery.,Which since you are trying to be pedantic (and failing), as a Seller on Amazon with supplied delivery dates at checkout, puts Sellers in the awkward position of also violating truth in advertising laws, and therefore are required under the law to refund the Buyer.,And of course doesn’t negate the venerable and wise ,’s point,that Amazon’s Agreement with you binds you and Buyer as well.,This clause would seem to negate the appropriateness of the rest of your quote.,I also do not see that Amazon telling the buyer something is the same as our TOS binding us to that same thing, e.g. Amazon can promise buyers something for nothing, but if we haven’t signed on for that, Amazon can fund that initiative from their own pocket.,I still want to see something that literally says we have signed on for this exact process, as it’s being implemented, and that ideally also says what happens when the item ultimately arrives.,You signed up for it.,“Without limiting your obligations, we may in our sole discretion accept, calculate, and process cancellations, returns, refunds, and adjustments for the benefit of customers. You will route any payments to customers in connection with Your Transactions through Amazon. We will make any payments to customers in the manner we determine, and you will reimburse us for all amounts we pay.”,
You agreed to the A to Z process as part of Amazon’s refund policies in your TOS. I have yet to read how Amazon has offered something not outlined in the return or A to Z polices.,First, the only mention of “material delay” is in regards to only paragraph A, regarding putting the goods in possession of a carrier, or paragraph C, promptly notify the buyer of the shipment.  Neither of which is the problem being discussed.  All these threads are about items that have been given to a carrier and notification have been given to the customers of their shipments.,
Second, The leap of definition of “rejection” to “refund upon request” especially in regards to keeping the item is absurd. Nothing says the item can be kept. That’s not what “reject” means in any dictionary.,Look, I get it. You don’t want to admit you’re wrong.  I’ve spent plenty of time explaining that nothing in federal law states that a buyer is under no obligation to pay for an item that is delivered late.  You’ve provided no evidence that it does.,On the plus side, I’m failing to be pedantic!,Here is a gem from the TOS:,And this one,Here is another tidbit:,And the part we are all waiting for:,Found this from a 2001 FTC flyer about prompt delivery rules:,And the most intersting part:"
"Amazon is telling customers to request a refund, package is lost",Selling on Amazon,"Good luck with that. I find Amazon rarely honors their own policy about this. Look up threads on this.,YOU DO NOT WANT TO SELL HERE. RUN RUN AWAY.  Amazon may destroy you.,You don’t.  Amazon will issue the refund and your account will be credited.  If they are FBA and the delivery is late, Amazon takes responsibility.  They are informing you the buyer was refunded.  Amazon will reverse the refund within 30 days.,Unfortunately 2 Day Priority is not a guaranteed service. You have to use Express 1/2 Day service to be guaranteed. If the location was shown to be there in 2 Days with UPS Ground you can actually use it instead of 2nd Day Air because Ground is a guaranteed service and it saves a lot usually over Air. Of course it has to show the delivery date to just be the 2 business days.,It’s only Amazon’s responsibility if they are FBA.  For FBM of SFP it’s the responsibility of the seller.  But if you use Amazon’s Buy Shipping and ship on time and it’s scanned on time, you are supposedly covered from any shipment delays or problems or A-Z claims.,It doesn’t.

He is usually one of the most helpful people on the forums when not annoyed with the DMV or EPA.,Thank you!  I hope not.,Here’s the original of what you said.  Can you please quote the part in federal law, or in the FTC’s interpretation of federal law, which backs this claim up.  Until that happens, I think all here would be wise to assume that federal law does not say “consumers are under no obligation to pay for orders delivered late.”  Amazon policy is different.,Same happening here and often show up as an A-Z claim. Also, Amazon is now auto-refunding orders without even consulting us regarding the return / refund issue. It’s so frustrating.,Same situation here. I also sell on eBay, ebay refunded customers for late packages by USPS and the next day it was delivered. USPS should be shut down if they can’t deliver with billions of taxpayer money they are wasting.,He helped me out a couple days ago.  I just think he’s mistaken about federal law. Something, which , pointed out, doesn’t necessarily apply here.,just keep the record of all orders refunded and submit a EZ claim to get your reimbursement.,
If you fulfill yourself, then inform customers on the current status of delivery with USPS being delayed, it on their website, officially! Amazon can’t override this! Some customers will understand and agree to wait, some chose to proceed with a refund of chargeback claim. You will get reimburse das long as the tracking shoes delivered. ALSO, include ""delayed during holiday shipping, or ""no refunds due to late holiday season or due to USPS late delivery ""  in your return policy to secure yourself.,
hope it helps,
Tatiana,Listen, USPS is struggling but that doesn’t mean Amazon and Ebay should be bullying their bread and butter. USPS has had to deal with elections, Covid absences and now Christmas. Starting last June a political appointment changes everything. Our delivery success rate dropped 10% when mail sorters and machines were removed from postal centers and staff was laid off. It’s criminal."
"Amazon is telling customers to request a refund, package is lost",Selling on Amazon,"They said negative reviews, not negative feedback.,This topic has been discussed for the past week or so.,
The bots won’t be turned off.,
You must refund or the buyer will call C/S and have an A to Z claim opened.,
USPS has trailers of packages sitting in distribution centers in  just about every major city hub that won’t be cleared until February.  So yes.  You are going to have to refund your buyer, unless somehow, some way, the package shows up in a few days.,
I’m outside of PHiladelphia.  The first warning signs for me was they lost an entire day mail pick up back in Mid November.   Packages scanned and haven’t moved since December 3rd some haven’t scanned at all.,
Yes the bots have to be turned off but they won’t be.,
Frustrating to say the least.  This will wipe out many seller unfortunately.,Yes that is exactly what happens.,You can message the buyer and tell them they can request a return so if the item arrives after christmas, they have until January 31st to return it.  Most are just so angry they  keep messaging saying refund me now.,The worst I have seen in 16 years here.,I’m sorry, I just don’t see any “loophole”. There is nothing in federal law that says a customer doesn’t have to pay if an order is late. I’ve read the interpretation and it, also, does not mention anything about late delivery. You made the claim, I just thought you had some basis for it.  I had never heard that claim before.,No worries, I just think you are mistaken.,Most A to Z’s are being paid immediately and the seller account is taking a hit.,
The most used excuse is “you did not ship on time” - which we did… OR “it did not deliver on time”…which we know.,
Buy Amazon shipping SHOULD protect sellers against these 2 issues, but right now it doesn’t seem like that is happening.,HOW do you email these buyers once the item has shipped? When I try to email a buyer, all the options (in Amazon’s drop down menu) are grayed out EXCEPT to offer a full refund! I can send your wonderful text IF the person emails us, THEN we can respond, but I can’t initiate such correspondence. So if the person chooses to hit the refund button instead of asking the buyer directly, we are doomed to give away our goods, apparently.,In the context, I assume he meant negative feedback.  People get them confused a lot.  I could be wrong.,Can someone show me the actual written policy that says Amazon has the right to do this? I’ve spent some time digging through the docs for “Transit Time” (neé Delivery Time), and all I can find is something like “Configuring an accurate delivery time for your products , ensure a good customer experience and , improve sales.” I see nothing that says “failing to meet deadlines that we impose and you can only change a little will result in us handing over both your money and product.”,I disagree with some people’s reading of the FTC code, and believe we have more leeway than that might imply in the narrowest sense … but I think we all know that Amazon doesn’t give a carp what the actual law says about anything, and will do whatever they can get away with, and we’ll have to suffer whatever that outcome is. So, this really hinges on policy (which Amazon will also ignore), and it would be nice to have something to quote back to CSRs. Thanks!,But it does say they are entitled to request an immediate refund if it doesn’t arrive when they are told at checkout it should arrive (or thirty days, whichever comes first)? Furthermore, there is no exclusion for in-transit or delayed by carrier (remember that in 1975 tracking didn’t exist yet). However, there is a rule that states if a customer receives a package that isn’t what they want they must retain it for thirty days before disposal and the shipper may retrieve it at their expense. You need to view the law as encompassing and not focused.,Untrue…if you purchase label via amazon…it’s ,, until amazon makes a decision.,… and if this is a metric for which our money can be dispensed like an ATM, why is Transit Time not a metric that displays in Account Health?,Can you please quote this?  I don’t see the word “arrive” anywhere within there either.  Everything in there is geared towards shipment, not arrival or delivery.,Hello, I am a relatively new seller and this is my first-holiday selling. I  am FBA and noticed lots of refunds because the item being arrived late. Since this is Amazon’s responsibility to get them to buyers on time why do I have to suffer the financial loss? Could you please explain the process? I am very confused. I really appreciate your time! Thank you,Not mine and all of my FBM orders are shipped on time with Buy Shipping.

A lot of my shipments are still showing in our main postal hub since first of December.,Yes.

Most people aren’t going to read or reply to the message anyway, then if they do happen to read it, they will be directed to the big fat refund button that will give them a free product. Then Amazon will deny your A-Z appeal after you automatically lose the initial claim, even if you appeal after the order gets delivered. Smrt business.,I bought 120 cubic feet of packing peanuts from an Ebay seller on Dec 4th (placed 4 orders) and they still have not arrived and tracking shows nothing after Dec 7th.  I contacted the seller and they sent me a link to a news article where they were featured regarding the USPS issues and are losing so much money on cancelled orders and refunds - I felt so bad for them.  I had already started a case with Ebay but I am not going to follow through with it now.  I’ll just wait until they arrive - I’ll need them for Valentine’s Day / Easter / Mother’s Day sales.,What federal law says this?,I contacted AMZ to see what steps we have to recover lost money and product.

Below is the email I received. While I don’t like the answer I will say it is the first time in 8 years of dealing with AMZ CS that I feel someone actually read my email and took the time to write a response instead of sending a non-related template answer:,Amazon,Dec 20, 2020 02:02 PM,Hello from Amazon Selling Partner Support,,We understand that you want to know if Amazon gives a refund and customer later receives the package whether you can take steps without any Amazon involvement to collect the funds they were refunded or get the package back and whether you can file a IC 3 form or not.,We want to inform that you cannot file a IC 3 form for buyer’s order or contact buyer to return a product without creating a return request.

And I’m also afraid of the negative reviews if I don’t comply, since Amazon already told them they’ll get their money back. It’s very frustrating ,We had over 150  refund request today.  We try to explain to the customer the shipping delays…they don’t care…they just open AZ claims. We have refunded 1000’s of dollars worth in the last few days.,This is if complete, true, and accurate a major change in Amazon policy.,Nothing in this code mentions that a customer doesn’t have to pay if items are delivered late.  Closest thing I can find is that the seller must SHIP items within 30 days of order completion.  The word “deliver” isn’t even located anywhere within that code.,Buyers have always had the ability to authorize a re-charge on their credit card. We have resolved some A2Z’s this way. I don’t know what policy is about , the customer to do this; since it probably violates the , of the last update on communications (i.e. “don’t do anything that would prevent us from handing your money to our customers”), I suspect if enough sellers ask for it, the option to do so without punishment will be removed.,If you used Buy Shipping, Amazon policy states that they will remove negative feedback that is related to delivery issues.,If this were my business, I would learn from this event. Amazon needs to have tighter controls over their own shipping. This screams “loose.” They need to set up a tracking system and keep track of when the shipment leaves, on which truck it leaves on, the time it leaves, the expected time of arrival.,I’ve had a few of these “requests” recently as well.,This is great advice, as I use amazon shipping our FBM orders.,Anyone have recent experience using Amazon shipping and buyers filing an A-to-Z claim?  Does amazon refund the buyer directly?  Or do they tell the buyer the package is still in transit?,That is only for prime orders and seller filled prime accounts. We do thousands of orders through Amazon weekly and since we are not prime, can not use Ship Station that way.,You should read the FTC’s interpretation and guidelines or consult an attorney. That ‘Loophole’ will feel like a noose if you try to slip through it.,Amazon does not have proper control over their procedures. These forums are a clear indication of this haphazard, casual approach to running a business. At Christmas time all shipping companies (including US Postal Service & Amazon) are overly busy.

He also said now that the vaccines are going into Transit with the USPS today that they will take Priority to all other mail. He said First Class Mail is getting neglected so hard right now. Just wanted to pass along some inside insight I heard today.,I’m getting emails like this from customers, now I understand why.  I am so disappointed that Amazon would do this.  When you are in trouble, it is always eye-opening to see who comes to your side and who does not.,Total Bull Sht! Everything we sell is custom and personalized.  We do not take returns period. It’s stared in our shop policy. Yet amazons ai robots are pulling this crap.,I completely feel your pain.  We worked so many hours to get our small business packages out and living the same nightmare.  Now Amazon wants to have a specialist call me to discuss why I’ve had so many refunds.  I’ve been trying to clean things up since their glitch on Nov 24th where I suddenly had a massive amount of orders show up that I had never seen and they were already late.  I guess they had a payment process issue on their end so it wasn’t pushed to our queue until payment received -but all the while aging out…  I’m reconsidering selling on amazon.,You did the right thing and I agree 100% with you on this and my account has been around since 2002.  It is the financial ruin and graveyard for many small businesses.,WOW! That’s awful.,From December 12:,
,
,Amazon’s system sends the “You can request a refund” message to ALL shipments that are running past the due date. It should be kept in mind that LOTS of Sellers do not use Amazon’s shipping system, which means those Sellers ARE responsible for that shipment (and therefore that refund) if the package is delayed past the due date or lost.,
If Sellers who use Amazon shipping are not pushing these requests to the A-to-Z Claim, it’s the Seller who is not leveraging the benefits that are built into the higher costs of user Amazon’s shipping.,
And that is not to say that Amazon doesn’t screw up sometimes, but this really isn’t anything to get bent up about. It’s about knowing your systems and responding in the proper way.,For the last 7 days, I have turned my account off (Vacation Mode) when we close our brick and mortar store and turn it back on when we reopen. Had 4 packages that were stuck in various USPS hubs and bought Amazon shipping and shipped Priority Mail, Seems like the 1st week of December was the breaking point for USPS,Luckily, Amazon is a very small percent of  our income generated,This is what the US government is telling consumers on the FTC’s website.,Which may help understand Amazon’s message, to customers.,Terrible situation for Sellers, for more information on the FTC’s rules and Federal Law regarding online mail order delivery rules and consumer protections, refer to the FTC’s page titled “,”,That’s all fine and good but we can’t afford these A-Z Claims.  We have around 6k orders that are late.  If 60 file an A-Z claim, our account may be shut down.  We are issuing refunds but telling customers we will be contacting them after we confirm delivery…just to plant in their head that we may ask them to pay again.  We already have had 4 customers contact us back offering to pay us for the order after we already initiated the refund.  The customer is happy to contact Amazon and authorized the re-charge., Not sure that refunding will protect your account…amazon also checks massive refunds…,We would love to use Amazon shipping but it is just not logistically possible when you have 10k FBM orders.

"Amazon is telling customers to request a refund, package is lost",Selling on Amazon,"It’s bad enough we have to deal with all of these refund requests, but now Amazon is telling people to request a refund because their package is late.  This is showing up for one of my orders that I placed - and get this - it was shipped by an Amazon carrier, not even the USPS or UPS!!,And this is why we are getting these messages:,It was shipped with Amazon, so yeah requesting a refund is correct. Amazon knows it’s own shipping system well,Yeah well, customers are contacting me for items I shipped USPS (that’s the only way I ship) and they are saying Amazon is telling them to request a refund.,ditto here!   This is so freaking wrong,I am just SICK over this!!!  I have been putting in 20 hour work days every single day for the last 3 weeks… for nothing???,Just got a screen shot from a customer with the same message “You package is lost, you may request a refund from the seller” with a nice big “Request Refund” button.,Nice.,I just can’t believe this is happening.  I have probably 1000 orders still in transit, not moving from USPS warehouses.  There is no way I can refund everyone, I will go out of business.  I’m a small handmade business - zero employees. I have been working 20 hour days for the last 3 weeks getting all these orders out on time.  So much for Amazon caring about small businesses.,These are Amazon bots telling sending customers these messages; under ordinary situations it makes sense that packages with no activity for a certain number of days are probably lost, but we are not in ordinary times.  If the customer goes to USPS it actually says your package is NOT lost and still on it’s way to you (in addition to the disclaimer on the top of their website).,Amazon should have addressed this issue already and will have to deal with it eventually with AZ claims; they are supposed to fund refunds of items not delivered IF postage was bought through Amazon’s shipping system.,I would call Amazon Seller Support and open a case, this will not immediately solve the issue but if enough people call in they will eventually deal with this issue.  At a minimum the bots need to be turned off.,I did open a case this morning - awaiting their reply.,It is crazy that Amazon has not addressed this yet, there should have been a communication on the Seller Central dashboard about this; at least a warning about using USPS would have bee n helpful.,We all need the post office (even UPS, FedEx, and Amazon), I would have thought that maybe they might have reached out to help them in their time of need.,Maybe they will make a poll for it?,Talk about making a bad situation worse. Even in this mess Amazon has no consideration for their seller community. They well know that the postal system is overwhelmed. I have 3 people this morning ask for refunds–EVERYONE of those delivery confirmations show the item was scanned (moving) Yesterday obviously not lost. I have 2 more marked out for delivery-both requesting a refund and one that was delivered on the 12th who this morning after getting the Amazon email wants a refund because AMAZON said they can get one.,
WHAT A TOTAL JOKE–why not send buyers a email letting them know of the postal issue and that items can be 2 weeks or more late-that is what many of mine are running. So if they get the refund and the packages get delivered are they going to return the item or send payment?? So now Amazon is giving away our products!!! Does Amazon care about the third party sellers???,LOL yes… that’s the solution.  Those polls are super helpful.  ,OK, dumb question. Why aren’t , doing this, if it seems so obvious? (I agree, it is the obvious solution, but waiting for Amazon to do it, rather than sending it yourself seems rather foolish),All the carriers are having major issues now, and of course, we have no control over that. But we should be able to mitigate the damage to our accounts with a little bit of effort.,Here’s are some sample letters that I’ve sent -,
Greetings (Buyer name),,I see that, unfortunately, your package has been significantly delayed and I offer my apologies for that.,
Amazon, regrettably, seems to be sending out wayward messages to buyers indicating that their packages may be lost and that they should request a refund, even though their package may ultimately be delivered. If you received one of these message, I do apologize. This was done by Amazon’s automated systems and is beyond my control.,Although it’s been a significant time since your tracking was last updated, this is not an indication that the package is lost. I’m sure you’ve heard of all the issues the carriers (USPS, UPS, FedEx) are experiencing this holiday season, and there are significant delays throughout the country. A recent New York Times article estimated there would be 7.2 million more packages needing to be shipped each day this holiday season than the system has the capacity to handle. You can imagine the impact that is having.,Adding to that are the number of package handlers who work in the mail distribution centers who are suffering with COVID infections, or quarantining as a result of exposure. The net result is that some packages are going to be delayed, and a small amount of them will suffer significant delays. It appears that yours is one of these, and I am so sorry.,Rest assured that you will be taken care of though, and your order will be made right. If the package does ultimately arrive, you can return it (unused, of course) for a full refund if it is too late for your needs. If it is confirmed lost (it’s too early to determine this now, which is why Amazon’s message was so misguided), you will also receive a full refund.,It’s too soon to identify any package as lost currently because there are many, many holiday orders that are still showing as in transit/delayed in the carriers’ systems.,I hope you can be a bit more patient and give the mail personnel time to get caught up. They are working hard, despite the latest COVID resurgence, to support timely holiday delivery for all. As they work through the backlog, your package will either arrive (and you can return it if no longer needed), or we will be able to confirm it is indeed lost. Few packages actually do get lost though, it is far more likely you will receive the package significantly late, and then can return it if you no longer need it.,Again, I’m sorry and appreciate your understanding and continued patience,,
Seller,Greetings (Buyer name),,If you received one of those ‘your item may still arrive but you can ask for a refund now’ messages from Amazon, I apologize but they sent those out in error.,Of course, you are protected if your item never arrives, and will be refunded in full if that is the case. However, I imagine you’re probably aware of the acute issues affecting USPS and the other carriers this season. If you have other packages that are in transit, you might want to Google ‘USPS inundated’. One of the articles is titled “USPS ‘gridlocked’ as historic crush of holiday packages sparks delays”.,In normal times, a package with no delivery scan for more than a week would be a sure sign of trouble, but in this holiday season, unfortunately, it’s not. There are more packages than we’d all like that are stuck in temporary limbo at some point in the delivery process. With more packages in the system than the carriers can process each day, compounded by staff shortages as workers are out as COVID resurges, some are unfortunately experiencing significant delays.,But I assure you that your order will be refunded in case the package never arrives, or that you can return it for a full refund if it eventually arrives, but too late for your purposes. I ask for your continued patience as we give USPS a chance to get caught up, so we can resolve your order properly.,Thank you,,
Seller,I’ve had 3 inquiries. Two buyers never wrote back and their packages have now been delivered. No refund, no A-Z, no negative feedback. One (stupid) buyer contacted me a couple more times, then filed an A-Z on the DAY their package was delivered. I used Amazon Buy Shipping and it was scanned on time so am going to dispute that one.,But even if you manage to ward off 2 out of 3 problems, that’s better that nothing, right?,This is a great response! I appreciate you sharing!,Amazon’s silence is deafening.,I have one of these Request Refund on a product I ordered - UPS shipping, not USPS this time. It’s half an hour away from me, and I am going to wait it out even though it’s overdue now almost two weeks. I am sure it will show up eventually and don’t want to ding the seller for something not their fault if I don’t have to.,On the other side of the house, as a seller I’ve gone on vacation mode. I have two buyers asking what’s the deal with their items not moving in tracking - so far no requests for refunds, I message them every couple days with status. But I don’t want to take the risk for more. Sales were slow anyway, I think mostly because my used book sources were all shut down since summer and my stock consists of long tails now (used books).,I’ll come back when the mess clears and people are cashing in those Amazon gift cards!,Thanks. , Feel free to use it, or edit it to write your own. If you get a lot of inquiries, you might want to save it as a template and just copy/paste it, with slight edits, to each customer. Most people really dislike getting form letters, so if you add a sentence that reflects each particular customer’s order, it will sound personalized, something like…,I see that, unfortunately, your package has been significantly delayed ,…,There you go, being all reasonable and understanding why your package is delayed. ,One of the most surprising things to me about this whole fiasco is how many sellers seem to view Amazon as the almighty and powerful One and feel that anything Amazon says must be obeyed.,I see Amazon’s message and think - dang, Amazon, here’s another stupid thing your automation messed up, now I have to waste time telling customers to ignore you because you don’t know what you’re doing.,But all these sellers who are panicking seem to think - oh no, Amazon told the buyer they can get a refund so I must give a refund immediately or Amazon will put my account at risk!,I just don’t understand that thought process. Amazon messed up here and did something dumb. Annoying, but they do dumb stuff all the time. Why not just tell the customer to disregard it because it was stupidity on Amazon’s part? Sure, , customers will ignore you and they may file A-Z’s and then you’ll have to fight to convince Amazon that Amazon is stupid, but , customers are reasonable and can understand what happened if you take a moment to explain it to them.,I don’t understand why so few seem to realize that’s an option. ,Because many of us , want our accounts suspended.  What a thought."
Items not received due to USPS delays- AZ Claims,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","Just wanted to let you guys know that all customers that message me about packages delayed but ask for that refund (usually Maryland, Virginia or the dreaded Philadelphia), when they ask for a refund I direct them to file an A-Z claim and they do, and I win half of them through Appeals, and 25% of the initial ones filed, Amazon funds it outright. So I would recommend to not do a manual refund but to do A-Z claim if your metrics can afford it."
Feedback Crossed-Out (Not Removed),Selling on Amazon,"Some horrible woman left feedback on my account complaining about the slow delivery of her book, caused by the COVID-related postal delays.,Total crap service! Almost a month and “Simon” refuses to acknowledge this issue. Even Amazon has concluded that the item appears lost. I realize mail moves slowly thanks to the civic crisis but this has become ridiculous. I regularly purchase books through second party sellers on amazon but I’ve never dealt with such a fool as “Simon” so unwilling to help. Avoid left coast books like the plague,, “The fulfillment issues associated with this order were not due to the seller”,Although Amazon “crossed out” the feedback and left its message exonerating me (before I even had the chance to read it), I am not happy that the feedback is still visible and legible on my account. For the record, I patiently and politely explained why the package was delayed, so her criticism of me is really annoying.,I’ve never had this happen before. Can the feedback be removed entirely? Even though Amazon did the “right” thing (and approved my A-Z claim based on timely posting), this turd sitting at the top of my feedback appears to be damaging my sales volume.,We have a few of these too.,Our perspective is that it is a “win” in the sense that the feedback is not counted,
against your overall rating.,More importantly to us is our consideration that it exonerates the seller from the,
buyers “rant”.,The Amazon Gods have publicly stated that the issue ,
From our perspective this nullifies the buyers rant to other prospective buyers.,Sure it might be better for it to be removed completely but we also consider that when a,
prospective buyer sees another buyers rant crossed out, they might consider that such rants,
are not acceptable as feedback on Amazon.,We feel your pain.,
Just trying to make lemonade.,I still feel like I’m being penalized through no fault of my own. Sales have plummeted since she left this feedback.

We hope this feedback is not the actual reason your sales are down.,These type of crossed out feedback’s have not seemed to affect our sales.,
They can hurt your pride however… if you let them.,I appreciate your wise words. While I wouldn’t entirely dispute the notion that my pride is injured, I’m much more concerned about the impact upon my sales.

People are losing their minds over COVID and lashing out. Unfortunately, people are motivated to leave negative feedback, and most professional customers have better things to do with their lives than leave feedback for their Amazon vendors.,I am a small seller, a one-man band. In 2020, I sold 1798 books on Amazon, but only 88 customers left feedback. That’s a rate of less than 1 in 20. I’ve been here for several years, and I remember a few years ago reporting a 1 in 10 feedback rating, so there are fewer and fewer people leaving feedback.,Last month, I came within a squeak of receiving 0 feedbacks in the previous month. II was terrified that one jerk would come along and leave negative feedback, showing 100% negative feedback over the last 30 days.,I wish they would scrap the feedback system, and have a rating system based on reliability and the likelihood of returns.,Happy New Year everyone!,That feedback does not qualify for removal.

I don’t know what you’re talking about.,So it was FBA?,No. Are you kidding? FBM. I wouldn’t let Amazon handle my inventory.,I thought Amazon will only cross through that feedback if FBA.  I think you are lucky that you got them to do that much.  I know how you feel, though, when you take great pains and effort to do a good job…,There is nothing in policy about removing feedback for delivery.,I didn’t get them to do it. I woke up one morning, checked my feedback, and there it was, feedback I’d never seen before, crossed-out. I was happy not to have to write groveling messages to Amazon, but I would prefer, honestly, not to have this feedback still sitting there on my account, deterring customers…although a couple or orders did dribble in.,You missed out the following section:,Amazon might strike-through feedback in the following cases:,So the second section applies to my sale. My point in starting this thread was to question why they strike through illegitimate feedback instead of just removing it (and also to let off steam).,Exactly.,Strike-through – not removal.,Thanks, that’s why I come to the forums:  learn something new every day!"
"Listing a book as ""used, like new""","Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","I am trying to sell a book that is brand new, but I know there are requirements for brand new books, and I want to list it as “used, like new.”  It still has the paper wrapper that came on the back cover and has never been opened.  But all I see as options are new or used.  How do I specify beyond new or used?,Once you click used, it will take you to your offer page.  There you can specify the condition.  If you want to add condition notes, i.e. in original wrapper, you will need to hit the advanced tab.,Don’t sell it New unless you have invoices. Used As New is almost as good if there aren’t too many sellers.,New, Used, and Collectible are the only condition groups for books.,If you list as New you should be prepared to supply invoices if requested.,If you list as Used you can use the condition notes field to explain condition. You must have Advanced View engaged to see the condition notes field.,OP said they want to list as used.,OP said “How do I specify beyond new or used?”,That could mean they were looking for a condition type other than new or used.

When do A-Z claims really threaten our business?,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","I have always had stellar performance but this holiday season mail issues and Amazons ease of giving out A-Zclaims EVEN when we are responding to the customer and even sending replacements is HORRIFIC!!!,I’m literally terrified right now.  My current ODR is 0.11 all from the 5 A-Z claims granted this week!!!  Several rude clients received the items just a day or two late.  I still have items being delivered and can’t imagine complaining as my head isn’t in the sand and I try to be a good human.,I filed an appeal on one where we shipped a replacement and even upgraded shipping.  Both now show delivered, she got her refund via A-Z and the response was, it was delivered late.,Please, before suggesting I use BUY SHIPPING, tell me how in the world you all use that when printing 500 shipments a day plus?  I use ShipStation as Buy shipping would take me hours to do one by one.  Have I just missed something that streamlines it?,Amazon hopefully will not suspend us for this absolute nightmare of a season.  Any one hear word???,Thank you and Happy New Year,,
Paula,First, never, ever send a replacement. Amazon rarely recognizes replacements sent FBM. The process is return (if needed or possible), refund and then the buyer places a new order.,You wasted your time appealing the A2Z as you did not use Amazon’s Buy Shipping nor get a signature at delivery.,500+ shipments a day would be hard using Seller Central. Shipstation can use AZ Buy Shipping but they normally want 20 cents a label. You do the business math. But $100/day in fees will take care of some refunds.,You need to keep your ODR <1%  Five A2Zs lost with 2,500 shipments would only be .2%,I did not know ShipStation can do that!!!  Do you know if I just call my rep?Yeah I’m 5 out of 4,614 and it says 0.11…I totally don’t math but agree that the 20 cents a label makes sense in these times.,Hmmm…I have always sent replacements because with my markup it seemed appropriate but with these ever changing times and the shockingly rudeness of today’s buyer, I believe change is in order.,Thank you!,Ohhh…only for SFP it appears and I have that engaged.  I removed myself from SFP this season as I knew we could not meet the deadlines with the way Nashville carriers were functioning.  We are a train wreck even now.,0.11%. is not bad .  1% is the limit.,I am usually at a steady 0.1or 0.2 . Mostly chargebacks from scamming customers ( I have never lost a chargeback but they sometimes effect the ODR if Amazon suspects you will lose it ),Call or chat with someone at ShipStation. They may even lower the fee or waive it for you. It started as a SFP only but I am told they expanded it. We use ShipWorks and thought about changing just to get that feature."
How to handle a customer who insists on getting a refund,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","If you cave in, you will have marked yourself as a compliant victim.  These people like victims who don’t fight back.  I you let them screw you this time, your name goes on the list of easy victims.  Then they will do it again.,Also, to protect yourself, forward all of this to ,To my thinking  a quick tell to the whole drop shipper thing is when they want the tracking. I no longer withhold the invoice from shipments, even when asked to, so I can discourage these dropshippers from buying from me. They return at a much much higher rate than ordinary customers.,I had a similar issue with a customer. Half the order was FBA and half fulfilled by merchant. They emailed me saying its the wrong item before they even received the item so I just assumed they meant the FBA item, which amazon refunded - 3 items, then once they received the item I shipped , they emailed again saying wrong item, I Knew this was a lie and asked for pictures. They called amazon who wrote to me saying the customer wants a refund as the item is damaged.,I sent the customer a prepaid label and asked them to ship, next day I received a message from amazon saying customer contacted them and said the item Cannot be shipped by ups as its hazardous. (its not. its made of plastic. ) I opened a case with amazon reporting the customer on suspicion of fraud and just decided to refund as it was clear that this customer knew what they were doing.,2 days later I get an email from Amazon again saying the customer wants a gift card instead of the refund as she is going through a divorce and cannot access the card that she used.,
At this point I’m now super angry at amazon as I don’t get why they even wasted their time sending me that email so I called them and explained that this is Cleary a fraudulent transaction and asked them not to send me any more emails/requests from user.,My advise, Just refund and forget about this customer and save your energy.,Samething happened to me order valued $239 i shipped with USPS priority mail it was delivered on time but customer said he never received item , he filed A-Z claim and granted as well i tried everything including snapshot of delivery but Amazon granted claim in favor of customer, i learned my lesson so always get “signature required” shipping i know it hurts v bad when someone does like this it v unethical but unfortunately it happens,Stick to your guns. The only reason people do this is because so many sellers are afraid to stand up for themselves against would-be scammers.,I sadly have to agree.  Just completed an amazon survey where I informed them that I have a 5 times higher (more actually, am being nice) return rate on Amazon than on eBay.  I launched a new product on Amazon that I have been selling on eBay for 10 years.  It is a DIY item, so I do get some returns when people discover that they are over their heads.  I am running 1.2 percent on eBay.  When I launched on Amazon, I got returns 4 out of 16!  I shut down the listing and removed all the FBA stock.  Not sure if my one single competitor on Amazon was involved, but I wasn’t going to wait around to get slaughtered here.,This is NOT a drop shipper it is a out of the country drop house address. what the people overseas do to get illegal items shipped to them when you refuse to sell the item overseas due to it being illegal to ship the item they use a drop house account. the one your dealing with is looking for free stuff on top of the illegal act. the post office as a 30 volume set of books telling you what items that are illegal to ship to other countries. like you can’t ship anything made of denim to Russia. If the package is intercepted by customs of any country in it;'s path and your return address is still on said package the authorities will be at your door. and NOT amazon’s to protect yourself never complete and order with such an address as you provided. the codes inside the address tell the drop house who ordered it and they forward it to them from their location for a fee. it is an illegal act in the USA to do this and when you report the address to the postal inspector they do act on shutting them down.We have been involved in shutting down four in Florida shipping goods to CUBA. also you can protect yourself by going to Staples or your local office supply and get a rubber stamp that says “illegal to export or forward outside of the mainland USA” and stamp it all over the package and label. 9 times out of ten the drop house will refuse it and send it back to you. or they are forced to repackage it and use their own info to send it to the illegal buyer. good luck.,May I weigh in? So if you ship an item to an address in the USA, you committed no crime. That is a freight-forwarder, not some criminal operation. If a crime is committed, the authorities will come visit the address of the freight forwarder, not the Amazon seller. Even if they make a mistake for some strange reason and come knocking on the amazon sellers door, their defense is crystal clear for all to see. On eBay I deal with the drop shippers all the time where I’m fulfilling the Amazon order. The issue that I have with them is if the USPS skips a delivery scan, they get refunded even though the end customer received the item. In fact the entire reason I even bothered to come to Amazon was I figured that I may as well compete with them here.as they were charging about 20% more for the same item. Glad to put a few out of business at least for my stuff.,I always love people weighing in with misinformation. I have been doing the online thing since 1999 and you may think your safe from fines and jail but you are very wrong. The old saying ,  of the  ,  excuses not. It is the sellers responsibility NOT to break laws or be party to breaking of a law the big business like amazon and others can care less they are here for their fees NOT to protect you… We found this out by our door bell ringing with the Customs agents at our door several years ago. this is how we got involved and have closed a few drop houses with simple reports of the address to the postal inspector over the years. so weigh in all you want you will be sorry when your address ends up with contraband attached in another country. you say it is not a criminal oufit that is WRONG it is since when they are caught they get closed and fined.,If I had a dollar for every law enforcement officer that has knocked on my door, I would have about $12.  That is NORMAL, they investigate things, discover your innocence, and MOVE ON to the perps if any.,
You are innocent and you did nothing wrong.  I too have been selling online since 1999.   If what you say is true, then Amazon would be guilty as the person shipping the LEGAL item to a LEGAL place and somehow ‘going to jail’…what??     tranquilo tranquilo,I just give them a refund, not worth the time going round and round, since there is no seller protection from Amazon. Buy what you can’t afford - then threaten the seller.  This behavior is encouraged by Amazon; they enjoy the spoils and hang all the losses onto the seller. Luckily most of my customers are decent people.,Thanks for the responses.,I have already emailed the buyer with a prepaid label. I followed the wording as suggested by one of the above posters - short and simple. That was very early Friday morning. I have not heard back from her yet.,I don’t agree with just refunding. It just teaches these buyers to keep doing that to other sellers. I have also reported this buyer to Amazon.,If I were to refund her without asking her to return the items, I might as well take the chance and let her file an AZ claim - Amazon may fund the refund themselves, the claim may get denied or she may lose (when Amazon asks her to use the prepaid label to return and she does not after so much time has passed). Of course, I may lose but I have rarely lost AZ claims, so I will roll the dice on this one. My metrics is good - 0% ODR, so I can afford to take the risk.,Ninja is such a pain, Emailing mutltiple times for tracking number prior to the ship date.,Did you also get an order from Ninja? If so, please be aware that she may give you a story of broken/damaged items and then ask for a refund without wanting to return anything.,So I emailed her a prepaid return label (Priority mail) on Dec 11, 2020 and told her to use the label within the next 3 weeks as a , return label is only valid for about 25-28 days. As of today, no movement in the tracking. And… she is no longer pestering me and did not respond to my last email about returning the 2 items because I told her “I need the items back to send them back to the manufacturer for an account credit since they are damaged” (true story, not made up). I plan on asking , to void this label and for a refund next week, before the label becomes invalid.,Her non-response (when she was always replying to my emails the following day) tells me her story is most likely bogus, especially since I inspected both items before shipping and packed them well. I have packed these items for the past 16 years and know how to pack them well.,If she does tell you the same story she told me, instruct her to return the items for a refund and provide her with a label (or tell her to open a Return Request through Amazon). Don’t give in to buyers like this, as it would only teach them to be dishonest."
How to handle a customer who insists on getting a refund,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","Sorry to hear that. Maybe she broke your item, or after 35 days, found out she didn’t like the item or it didn’t perform as she had expected. Since you sell fitness products and I am a fitness person, I understand some fitness equipment or items just do not perform as expected, perhaps because the user is not using it in the correct manner or as instructed. In this case, I could see why she wanted to return it. It sucks for the seller though, as we are required to accept used products.,In my case, I think she was just trying to get some free products from me. I don’t really believe BOTH items have arrived damaged as she has claimed. In this time and age, most people have cell phones that take pictures. Many years ago when I have a flip phone, my flip phone took photos too. And before that (back in the 90s), a lot of us have compact digital cameras. I would say her story is not believable to me.,We also have the same feeling. In our case, it is absolutely fine if she has used and damaged the product after 35 days. We always issue full refund having said that she must return the product per policy using the pre-paid return shipping label the seller provided…,These are concerns to worry about after the item is not retuned and an A to Z claim is decided against you. Not before. Customer service is following a checklist and an A to Z claim is normal and we have rarely ever had one ruled against us (always won the appeal) when we do the following.,I don’t know what types of fitness products she had purchased from you. I know some are hard to ship back. Things like gym machines (I recently bought a compact machine for workng out at home due to gyms’ temporary closure), dumbbells, bosu balls, etc. are hard to ship back as they are heavy or big, and hard to pack. I have also in the past year, purchased other smaller fitness items from Amazon such as stretch bands and core sliders and those are small and lightweight and easy to send back. Fortunately, everything I have ordered through Amazon including those from Warehouse Deals, have worked great, so I didn’t have to send back anything. But I am also one, who do not like to return stuff I buy online - it’s just a hassle.,I think I am dealing with a case of freigh forwarder. She is in Canada and it’s hard to return stuff back to me, so she would rather just ask for a refund. That being said, I don’t mind sending her an immediate refund if she had emailed me pictures of the damaged items and tell me the truth (that she’s in Canada and cannot easily return those items). Her multiple excuses are making me very suspicious, so now I have to provide her with a prepaid Priority mail label even though she may not be able to use them since she may be in Canada.,Yes, I understand your point, and the steps you mentioned, are usually the ones I follow. I have been on this board for a long time (though I don’t post a lot) and have learned these are the steps to follow. I too, have very rarely lost an AZ claim (just had several this year that ruled against the buyer or Amazon-funded).,It’s just that I rarely come across a buyer with so many excuses, one after another - INR, damage, cannot provide pictures - all the while, insisting on getting a refund without telling me if ONE or BOTH were damaged (so I could refund appropriately). I did tell her in the 2nd email to please provide pictures or I could provide her with instructions on returning the items.,Ok, have to go and prepare a prepaid label, and tell her that we cannot refund till we receive the items back.,While understanding you have been around a while, I mean no disrespect, when I say Amazon is not a negotiation platform with customers. You ship X you get X returned or nothing happens. Any deviation or requests outside of that equation puts you at risk.,This statement is a problem for Amazon and can get you in trouble regardless of intent. All the customer has to do is say you demanded pictures and your A to Z is closed in buyer favor. This is why many sellers say “do not communicate”,You should provide this immediately for any communication inquiring about a refund, or even possible refund activity. Any other attempt to gain information can and will be used against you. We have had this happen numerous times with a business we no longer have on Amazon.,We make a game of return labels at the office for our seller fulfilled orders. It involves a wheel, a dartboard, and alcohol at the end of the month.,It is not gym machines, it is a small item! she just doesn’t want to return it! Also we can schedule a pickup …,Thanks for your input. I tend to be a seller who communicates or tries to help customers. That’s often reflected in my feedback. I have been praised for that (including receiving an email recently from a buyer asking me about a product she has ordered, and she later emailed me back, saying that was the “most perfect response she has received”.),In any case, I noticed this particular buyer does not seem to want to communicate much, so I shall provide her with the label and try to move on. I have a feeling that she would not want that - I will probably receive a neg and/or AZ claim shortly after.,I appreciate your nobility, and was only concerned for your fiscal stability and Amazons rigid policy applications,It is inevitable no matter how honest your intentions and actions, so apply that understanding to any stress or ego you may apply to that concern. All of us at the office used to worry, now we have fun with that worry. Kind of like a gallows humor for customer feedback. It works for us, hope you have something similar if needed.,Sometimes, I find selling on Amazon more frustrating than any other platforms including my own website - I have had less than 10 returns/refunds in the past 16 years on my own website. My website customers rarely complained.,There are times I just want to quit selling on Amazon to reduce the stress (I am ready to retire from selling here anytime). My website is starting to bring in more sales this year, especially in the past 3-4 months when sales here were slow (with tons of competition). My website revenue is higher than my revenue here some weeks. My eBay customers are usually nicer too.,Thanks for your comment on the last part about receiving neg and AZ claims. Well, it’s still difficult for me to joke about getting an AZ claim or a negative feedback. But since I am ready to retire from selling here (maybe not yet, because I still generate a pretty good income here), I am starting to care less about claims and negs. It was harder to deal with them 5-10 years when I was still relatively new here and wanted to keep perfect metrics. I am now a little tired of dealing with/catering to Amazon customers’ crap. Like you said, stick with the basic steps you and others have outlined above, and then try to move on and not them bother me - I am starting to get better at this.,One more question. How should I phrase my next email to her, after her last email just stated “Thanks for your reply but I am not able to provide you with images as I don’t have phone to take images so I request you to please help me with the refund and close this issue as soon as possible.”,Should I reiterate that our return policy is we need to have her return the items for a refund?,I am trying to write a polite email after hearing all her excuses and after she has just stated she would like this close asap.,Dear buyer,,Attached is your pre-paid return label. Once your return is received, your refund will be processed.,Regards,,
FunSelling,As noted by many sensitive people here on the forums, I am quite terse, so you may inquire with others how to better craft a reply. BUT here is my attempt. Always state Amazon return policy, not yours, as that is the only one that matters.,Dear Valued Customer (a lie),
Per Amazon policy, a return label has been provided. We will process your return within two business days of receipt. Please follow the instructions provided by Amazon in your purchase/return details.,Don’t you hate when that happens…,Always listen to your inner self— you’re usually going to be right.,That is good, and congrats! You are not a sociopath!,That is valid.,One of the primary reasons we switched to FBA. None of the people in our business have a “customer service” mentality, so it is best we do not answer the phone. Laughing at customers tends to make them mad.,
A few of us listen/watch a popular military podcaster/author/speaker called Jocko Willink. We have learned how to keep the ego in check and to manage the Id, in order to overcome the BS associated with dealing with buyers (and some other sellers). Jocko is not for everyone, but his TED talk and podcasts help with keeping everything in check when we get amped about some dork customer.,I cannot switch to FBA due to multiple reasons unique to my product line and my location. I have spoken to FBA specialists a couple of times and researched the issue, and determined it was not very feasible for me to pursue FBA.,Plus, I have always self fulfilled, and have been doing so for over 20 years. I like to have more control of my business.,Actually, most of my Amazon buyers are great people. The lady who emailed me a few weeks ago, saying I had provided her with the perfect answer, was an Amazon customer. There are still many good people out there. It’s the few bad apples that are spoiling the “fun” for us.,Many valid reasons, I was just pointing out one of ours, in the hopes of giving options for less stress.,Keyword “,”.,Do this always.

How to handle a customer who insists on getting a refund,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","Buyer placed an order for 2 items (same type of items) on Oct 22. Immediately after placing the order, she sent this email, “Hi, Please help with the tracking number. Thank you”,Based on USPS’ tracking, the Priority mail package was delivered Oct 26. Tracking said it was delivered to “an individual”.,On Dec 3, she sent a short email, “I have not yet received the package. Please issue me a refund.”,I sent her my form email, instructing her where to look for the package or I would open a case with the USPS, or send her info on how to get a refund from Amazon for INR (item not received), in which Amazon is supposed to refund as I had printed her label using Buy Shipping. I sent her a reply on Dec 5.,On Dec 6, the day after I sent her my response, she replied with, “Received damaged item, Please check and help with refund.”,I was getting suspicious of this person. Most customers I have dealt with, when receiving damaged item, would mostly ask for replacements because they really wanted what they had purchased. Also,  about 50% of them would more or less tell me more about the damage, even if it’s a one-liner, such as “the item was received leaking”, “the item was dented”, or “one part of the item has broken off.”, etc.,I replied on the same day, asking if one or both items were damaged (I packed both items very well with bubble wraps, and have rarely received complaints of damage). I found it hard to believe both items were received damaged as I have always inspected my items before shipping. I also asked in the same email, what type of damage the item(s) have sustained. I offered 2 solutions - email me pictures or she could return the items for a refund.,Today, Dec 9, she sent this email, “Hi, Thanks for your reply but I am not able to provide you with images as I don’t have phone to take images so I request you to please help me with the,
refund and close this issue as soon as possible. Thank you.”,The order is around $46. How would you handle this person? I am thinking of sticking to my gun, offered her a prepaid return label and ask her to send both items back. I am thinking of telling her that I needed the items back so I could send them back to the manufacturer for an account credit (true story).,By the way, I reported her to Amazon a few days ago after she sent me the third email, claiming “received damaged.” I had used the Report Buyer button.,I want to add that I am starting to suspect this buyer may be a dropshipper. I have received many orders in the past several years from dropshippers and somewhat recognize their MO (looking at their name and address fields).,Her shipping address looks like this:,
FFUSA(AVC: N8833xx-CA-Name of a person),
xx RANDALL AVE STE xxx,
ROCKVILLE CENTRE, NY 11570-xxxx,Buyer’s “name” was Ninja. No phone number. Amazon says the address is “commercial”.,Provide a label and tell her no refund without return. No further explanation needed.,If the buyer has any issue with the product you sent them and it is inside the return window (30 days), you must authorize the return within 48 hours. If you do not and the buyer complains to Amazon, Amazon will issue a full refund and let the buyer keep the product. The seller also gets a metrics hit.,It looks to me like it could be an order for a Canadian customer of hers (due to the CA part of the address). I did google her address and it looks like it was at a commercial building.,If she was really a dropshipper, that could explain why she offered so many excuses as to why she could not return the item(s) to me. Maybe she didn’t physically have them anymore. She might have issued a refund to HER buyer due to whatever reasons and now is coming after me for a refund.,Or she was trying to scam me - nothing wrong with the order but it’s easy to ask me or Amazon for a refund to keep the money from me and the money from her buyer.,Anyone has seen the above shipping address before?,That address looks like a freight forwarder. Buyer is probably overseas and had their items sent to the forwarder to be sent to them. Probably why they don’t want to return.,Same advice as before. Provide a label and no refund without return.,Well, as outlined above, the order was delivered Oct 26 and she complained in early Dec.,The problem is she first claimed she didn’t receive and then she claimed the item(s) were damaged after a whole month has passed. Both complaints were outside of the 30-day return window. For this particular order, Amazon does not provide auto-return label due to the nature of the item (considered hazardous), so usually for this type of item, I may provide a prepaid return label on my own dime - I use , to generate a label.,So should I supply her with a return label, since both emails of complaint were sent after 30 days have passed?,Also, does anyone have any experience with refunding/returning issues with dropshippers? I have dealt with dropshippers for at least the past 5 years on Amazon, if not more, and have never had a problem with them.,Oh yes, it could be a FF too. I have dealt with those as well.,We did the same and this morning she opened an A-Z !! We responded to Amazon and told them we have already provided a pre-paid return shipping label, hopefully they are going to read our response!,Sure, I was already planning to do so - providing her with a label and asking her to return for a refund, even if they are both damaged.,I am still worried about 2 things though:,
a) negative feedback,
b) A-Z claim. How would Amazon rule in this case if I have emailed her a prepaid return label and tell her to return within 30 days (, return label is only valid for about 28 days)?,We are facing the same issue and this morning she opened A-Z claim! We responded to Amazon and told them we have already provided a pre-paid return shipping label, hopefully they are going to read our response! we will keep you updated,We always deal with a buyer one step at a time. INR claim, send INR template. Change to damage, authorize return. We want Amazon to see that we responded appropriately and within the timeframe required.,Thanks for your response. Are you talking about the SAME buyer, Ninja, with the same shipping address as mentioned above? Or are you talking about a different buyer who happens to be a dropshipper/freight forwarder too?,Outside the 30 day window but not outside the extended holiday return window. Anything delivered after 10/1 can be returned until 1/31.,Yes, that’s what I have done in this case, except I cannot “authorize a return” the normal Amazon way, other than authorizing it through email because the item is considered “hazardous”, so return is not auto-authorized. \,I would email the buyer, saying they could return and I may provide a prepaid label if it’s not a case or a claim of buyer’s remorse.,Different buyer, same experience in terms of the process. We authorized her return request and uploaded a pre-paid return shipping label, also we emailed a copy of the label via Amazon messaging system. She was still able to contact Amazon customer services and open an A-z claim this morning. We responded to A-z claim and awaiting their response. She has been using the product for more than 35 days and now she says the item is defective!,OK, thanks for the reminder on the extended return period.,The problem is the , return label is valid for only about 28 days. After that, I may need to email her a new return label (I would void the first label if it’s not used after about 26-27 days and send the buyer a new label).,Provide a prepaid return label or a return address and do this quick before a claim is filed that you will probably lose.,Perfect solution,Repeat as necessary.,We are aware of the extended return window, however we don’t understand why Amazon’s customer service open A-z claims considering that they can see we have authorized the return request and provided a pre-paid return shipping label. The buyer should follow the policy and return the merchandize for refund."
Arrived Too Late Return Excuse,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","I must admit I don’t have a lot of returns normally but recently I noticed Amazon (as they do with everything) took all our return options away and just tell us to do what they say.  I had a customer return something that was delivered in the time window (they ordered the 21st) but used excuse that it arrived too late, which it did not.  When I try to refund the order I am unable to take off the return shipping cost due to the excuse.  Why the hell does Amazon not give us any control?  They should at least check the date it was supposed to arrive and not take away the return shipping charge if it did indeed arrive on time.  Heck it almost made it back to me before it was supposed to arrive.  Any solution for my Rant?,I’ve had about 30 of those.,Amazon is wise to not give sellers control,Let it sit for 7 days, wait for it to get auto refunded, then open a safe-t-claim for Wrong Reason Code.  It’s a crappy process, but that’s what they give us to work with.,Why would you say that?  We have had that ability for many years.,Yes, but they would refund the initial shipping also, right?  So then if Amazon denies my claim like they pretty much do 99% of the time I would be out the initial shipping too.,Of course not, but they will refund the return shipping., tells us the following:,And , tells us:,Finally, Amazon tells Sellers in ,:,Other Sellers have recommended that the customer file an A-Z claim to achieve the best SAFE-T claim reimbursement results.,And to directly answer your question regarding deducting shipping costs, return shipping costs may only be deducted from the refund amount when the return reason is Buyer Faulted. Item Arrived Late is a Seller Faulted reason and therefore return shipping costs are to be borne by the Seller.,There is problem with buyers choosing item arrived late when it arrived early.  They should not allow customers to choose item arrived late when it arrived early , it should not be hard to code that into the system.,I have had orders come in Friday with a ship by date of Monday/Tuesday.  We ship it Friday.  FedEx home delivery deliveries it Saturday or Sunday. Buyer returns it as arrived late.  Item was delivered before we are required to even ship it out.  Explain to me why that would be Seller Faulted ? Was delivered early not late .,Thanks for the info but you missed the key point.  The order was not delivered late.  They just chose that as the excuse.  Amazon needs to check that before not allowing for return shipping.,You have the right to appeal the return reason, but that will not absolve you in the meantime of your obligations to Buyer in the meantime. You are required to respond appropriately within 48 hours to the Buyers message. Amazon is not under the same pressure to respond to you (fair? no)"

It CLEARLY states only ONE account per region, unless there is a legitimate business need. I am pretty sure that they do not have any legit reason other than wanting to drown out all competition and manipulate the Amazon system.,This does not even come close to also explaining the feedback manipulation which is another HUGE violation of Amazon policy.,Seriously, only a few minutes of research on this shows how blatantly obvious that this business is manipulating the system for their own gain.  If they are to do this, what is stopping every seller from doing the same thing? Action needs to be taken against these bad actors.,Found 2 more stores of theirs on Amazon.

Sellers remove negative feedback without buyer's consent,"Selling on Amazon,Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns","Wow. I thought feedback manipulation was a permaban.,With the cooperation of employees/contractors on the inside, nearly anything is possible for a scam seller. This kind of brazen and obvious manipulation/scamming/cheating is so disheartening. It is a total slap in the face to Amazon’s buyers in terms of transparency and offering a good buying experience (and for Amazon, isn’t it supposed to be all about the buyers?), as well as a slap in the face to honest sellers who play by the rules and, you know, actually SHIP orders to buyers as promised.,I wonder… out of all the orders placed through these sellers scamming, how many actually get delivered? Based on the negative feedbacks that have disappeared, I’d guess the number is frighteningly low. And potential buyers don’t know that, so they end up duped and disappointed. Way to go, Amazon.

I reported 5 chinese sellers 2 years ago for selling an item that does not match the catalog page, is NOT made in the USA (the original listing is for a USA-ONLY made product), which is why the chinese listings don’t match.  I sent plenty of pictures showing side-by-side the differences that did not match the catalog page.,Three were removed.  2 remain selling non-matching, lower quality product 2 years later.  Another chinese seller just joined, also with non-matching product, as it is ONLY made in the USA.,Tally, how did you manage to see that information I have highlighted in picture below,

Yesterday, I went and found they were 100 positive.,So tell me how they managed to get all those buyers to remove the negatives?,I have direct evidence that these sellers are all within a 5-10 mile radius in North Dallas, TX and that they are NOT Chinese sellers. For years they have been slowly buying previously established accounts and then they always list on the exact same pages on Amazon. When they have an item, they are listed all within pennies of each other. This way they are the ONLY offer on the page. No one will have any option to purchase from anyone but them!  It is quite ingenious, but is an utter violation of Amazons selling terms.,Please see this screenshot below.  Each of these sellers are the EXACT same entity.This is one example of the thousands of listings that they are all on together.,Add this all to the fact that they are also getting all of their feedback removed, and no one can compete with them.  They also clearly buy feedback to manipulate the system further.,.,Amazon states that having multiple selling accounts on Amazon is an account violation. You are only able to have separate accounts if you do not list on the same products. It is CLEAR that this seller is abusing this as they list on thousands of listings together.,They may make it look like they are different, but they are not. It would be fairly easy to buy established accounts, setup separate bank accounts for each one, and have different mailing addresses for each  account.  After doing the research and having direct evidence, I am 100% positive that these are all the same seller.,I am truly hoping that a Moderator can please report these bad actors.,  Can you please look into this?

It is also more than this. Every one of these sellers are the same entity and they are all located in the same city. They manipulate the Amazon marketplace by flooding it with all of their accounts. Then they manipulate their feedback so that they have the insanely high appearing feedback.  Both of these tactics help them drown out every other seller that they compete with.

The system let you choose between some choices,
Please let me know how it goes to you,Do you really think that just because I said don’t poke the bear and don’t get bogged down with other sellers that I am manipulating my feedback? Seriously? I am not, and I never have. I have just had enough Amazon problems to know that the outcome most often is the “no good deed goes unpunished” sort of trajectory. I’m just saying Amazon will not be grateful for him pointing out the issue, and it will most likely make his own life hell. That’s just the honest truth about selling on Amazon. I constantly get “inauthentic complaints” that aren’t legit, but what can I do? Fight with Amazon? I can’t, and it only ends in the appeal getting rejected because I didn’t “take responsibility”, even when the customer emails me back on the Amazon system saying they never meant that in the wording of their complaint. It’s just how it is. Sometimes it sucks, and you just have to suck it up. That’s life on Amazon, and there’s no reason to make it harder than it already is.,We see the concern but want to note that sellers ,  need buyers permission to remove feedback.,I get them removed all the time when they are FBA. I very rarely get a negative on an FBM order, but sometimes those can be removed, too.,You need to stop worrying about other people and worry about yourself and maybe your sales will go up.

No. But I keep doing my business because in the long run that storm gon hit them harder than anything I can do them. Stop being childish stop looking back during the race and do what you gotta do to succeed.,I was once offered a partial refund for removing my feedback. That’s probably what’s happening.,I agree. I have bought from booksellers with many, many feedback, all of it perfect, only to discover a set MO- they claim shipment but provide no tracking. When you request tracking several times, they refund and send a disgustingly smarmy letter of apology. I’ve never left them feedback but I’m certain I their 100% were the product of chicanery. How many buyers don’tstay on top things?,These kinds of sellers erode confidence in the marketplace, especially for 3rd party sellers. It’s all of our business.,I’m not willing to take that gamble and agree, as I also agree with , - this needs to be investigated and curbed. Other sellers shouldn’t need to be policing this. If a bot can close a $4.95 listing for being too high priced, this can be similarly handled.,Thanks to OP for shedding some light.,same exact thing happened to me about 3 years ago…i was even getting coupons for free accessories to remove my negative and yes it went straight to my personal email, not through Amazon messaging.,The competitor is important factor to grow your sales volume.,Amazon closed this seller last year but they are open now. They do not need Benevolent Jonathan’s help anymore,
,100% positive and more than 1000 positive feedback by Benevolent Jonathan on August 31, 2019.,I agree 100%. The only way a seller could have that many feedback removed on a daily basis is if they were cheating and paying someone off (In My Opinion).,There is no way to have dozens of feedback removed within hours that are not FBA orders, and those would show the typical cross-out and Amazon statement.,I agree that the OP should focus on his own business and worry about things he/she can control, but there is also nothing wrong with bringing this to the attention of other sellers on the forums and hopefully in the process, get the attention of a mod who can look into it.,We shouldn’t forget the huge insider scam that was uncovered a few years ago. Amazon employees (in China I believe), were selling services to have feedback removed and even suspended accounts reinstated. Amazon eventually found out and busted those involved but it went on for some time before they got wind of it.,There were multiple posts on this forum about the exact same thing for months. Maybe even over a year before Amazon discovered the scam and got rid of those involved. Maybe this is the new 2020 scam and if so, hopefully Amazon will become “aware” and handle it quickly."
Sellers remove negative feedback without buyer's consent,"Selling on Amazon,Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns","If you look at what the OP shared, these are not product reviews that were removed.  They were negative feedback about the seller.,The theory why this is happening is quite simple.  Chances are virtually 100% it’s a Chinese seller.  Chinese sellers have inside people at Amazon who do this work for them illegally, and there is little to no oversight or accountability in China to stop this.  Amazon has 100’s or 1,000’s of employees either in China or which have access to the Amazon Core system which are doing all this rogue activity.  You can go on the Black Market and buy Reviews, Review Removal, Feedback Removal, ASIN changes, and purchase your competitors contact information (this list goes on and on).  Vendor Central accounts are a very hot commodity on the black market and those accounts have all kinds of special privileges.  If you OWN a Vendor Central account, then you are getting “premier customer support” along with it.,Amazon WANTS China to succeed very badly and to take over the marketplace.  Amazon has forgotten that it was USA sellers who built them into about 3/4 of the way into a TRILLION dollar company.  In my experience Amazon has put all their eggs into the China basket and is literally rolling out the red carpet for these guys.,I was reading a very in depth analysis by super knowledgeable folks today and my mind was blown.  They have people in Shanghai and other cities who keep them advised.  They were at the conference and have gone great lengths to expose what is really going on (even showing all the advertisements where you can buy all the favors we all wish we had).  China has Fulfillment centers, they have 100’s of full time people going about actively promoting and growing the Amazon base in China.  They have rolled out Amazon Global Logistics based in China and pushed down all the other 3rd party logistics companies.  They had in December over 10,000 Sellers at conference in Shanghai, the largest convention center in China.,If your competitor hails from China, do not expect any action on this.  China sellers have a different set of rules than USA sellers.  Based on my experiences with Seller Support and FBA treatment of our Inventory we have decided to STOP sending any further products.  We have stopped all activity to grow our FBA business and our goal is to be 100% off this platform within one year.,In the last 5 years China has completely taken over the Amazon marketplace.  The USA has less than 1,000,000 of total sellers, only 385,000 are Professional level and around 600k are hobby sellers paying the $.99 per item sales fee.  The numbers are fuzzy, but it would appear that nearly 40% of all the largest sellers are based in China.  Huge numbers are from China with a base here in the US.,The PROBLEM is with the USA business model in my opinion.  USA sellers come from an Ebay mentality and want to sell secondary market goods by the truckload because that inventory is so readily available.  Amazon HATES arbitrage and liquidated goods, returns, or used items.  I believe the culture at Amazon has changed and the USA seller means nothing today.  Chinese sellers are 100% offering brand new retail packaged goods straight from the Mfg to the consumer and that is the only business model Amazon wants.,I had an experience a few months ago where I bought a pair of over the ear bluetooth headphones for $65.  When I got them they were sized to fit someone about 12 years old!  They were just tiny, uncomfortable, didn’t go all the way over my ears, and I hated them.  The $40 set you can buy at a Truck stop are far better.  So I returned them and left a 1 star review because they literally sucked that bad.,Days later, the seller started emailing me ,If someone abuses the ridiculous system we have to obey, i think it does affect our business.,He WAS referring to feedback removal when it is entirely a product review.,You nailed it. And the theory about arbitrage and new vs used goods is righto on the spot. However, amazon does hold onto sellers of used goods when the product is affecting the catalog variety.,i had many emails with turning leaf books and I didnt get anyone who was chinese either in name or diction.,
There was a lois and a woman with a greek name. They all sent form responses. I finally read their feedback and found the same scam they did on me they did to others.

Based on my experience the sellers are removing more feedback than is within the norm - or even close to the norm.,In my opinion, they’ve got someone on the inside at Amazon removing feedback for them or facilitating this. I do know that some larger companies have Amazon dedicated account reps. Depending upon the account rep will determine the amount of assistance a seller will obtain. It could be above board feedback removals facilitated by a dedicated account rep.,I noticed they had 100 positive when I ordered from them, and a few week later had like 82 percent. I wondered about it and then I read what the complaints were.,
I ordered a book, at the last minute, they sent shipping confirmation with no tracking.,
I asked for the tracking and they canceled the order, after they had shipped it!  this saved their metrics.,
Considering that I have been 100 positive for a year and a half but no matter how many times I ask Seller-performance, they list last years rating as my life-time.,

Is there any real difference between an amazon business buyer and a regular buyer though?,Their NAME says it all I think…,Business Buyers have access to business pricing (e.g., tiered discounts by quantity) that non-Business Buyers don’t. Eligible businesses can also submit their resale or tax-exempt documentation to avoid being charged tax incorrectly. Finally, Business Buyers can see more Seller information, including not only shipped orders but also business certifications, DUNS numbers, etc.,But IRL? Probably not. ,While I mostly agree.  Bad sellers staying on the platform or even just not having accurate feedback hurts all sellers that are doing a good job and trying to make a living.,If they are so good at selling why so they get so much negative feedback in the first place?,You can remove negative feedback you just didn’t knew,
Specially when customers love to do feedback revenge or add inappropriate content or information,I reviewed each screen shot very carefully but don’t have enough information to offer an opinion…can you post another 30 or 40 screen shots so I have more info?,So, how do you get dozens of negative feedbacks removed if I cant even get 1 removed.

After watching for two months, and sending in complaints and all the responses were phrased as if I was speaking Chinese to them, I finally gave up. I had had to wait a month for a product that was supposedly sent 2 days after ordering. When I finally got it with no indication that it was from an Amazon seller, only that it was sent from Sam’s Club and the tracking showed it had been sent 5 days previously. And 200 miles from my house no less!,The point being, for some reason Amazon is helping some sellers to do this and there is nothing we can do about it. Period. I learned to not fret or get upset as it wouldn’t do a bit of good. I don’t know why they are allowed to steal money like this, but they are. I only have to give MY customers a good experience.,If this company is your competition then you are also a book dropshipper.

In my mind the complete lack of quality control makes this business model a nightmare that can only survive with lots of cheating.  Good luck.,MLH is correct about YOURS could get shut down… it happens all the time.

And if you notice, they have 95% I think it was for LIFETIME…to me this means when they first began selling, they were not as good at customer service and did not know how o remove bad feedback, once you are doing this for years,  you find out many many ways to remove the feedback and you do not have to violate policy to do it… So, yeah… don’t worry about them… they are most likely just better at Selling one amazon than you and I.,Yeah that basically spells it out, the only answer how the seller OP is referring to is having that much feedback removed within hours is that its an inside job.,Having 100% removed is unusual, especially in a few hours or just a day -  in my experinece after patiently following up and messaging buyers who’ve left negative reviews, maybe half will respond and remove the review if their issue is fixable. The other half never respond.,I definitely agree that this is an inside job, and quite possibly related to organized crime. In any case there is undoubtedly money changing hands, that much I can pretty much guarantee. That makes it a huge concern for Amazon.,If I were you I would not want to post this stuff publicly. If they have people on the inside then they can get to your account with ease (Speaking from my own personal experience of having my account destroyed by insiders. I would not be surprised if they are still killing it, as outside of COVID I was getting the BB less than 3% of the time, consistently). I would send this straight up the ladder to the BM Team and not bother SS with it either.,Many sellers respond with facts, truth, experience and common sense. Just because that is not helpful to this persons desired outcome is not the responsibility of the party replying. There is not always rainbows and sunshine at the end of everyone’s Amazon problems. Most of us are just trying to rip the band aid off of the sellers issues so they can focus on profits and success on Amazon.,
Lamenting over feedback is kind of low on the priority list for successful sellers on Amazon. Usually the issues revolve around a few core issues.,May I suggest spending less (like…zero) time worrying about what other sellers are doing, and focus on your own business?,This has been covered, jonboy. The OP IS focusing on their business, because this affects his/her business dramatically. Someone else pointed out that s/he should focus on getting the BB… this issue is dramatically affecting that, too.,May be this person works on Amazon and can delete the bad feedback anytime they want.,
I am on Tally’s side.,Apparently, no one else seems to care about your discovery, but I do. We should all be concerned about what other sellers are doing because what they do can directly or indirectly effect each one of us. There are people protesting in the streets right now over ‘perceived fairness and inequality’. The rules aren’t the same for everyone, and they should be.,For my two cents…forget the forum boot lickers. If it helps you sleep better trying to get to the bottom of something thats affecting you, keep putting in the work. Its just one of many ways that you are helping yourself and your business.,They are not stupid.  Amazon has automated almost everything. Even when a person looks at something, their choices are automated.  The positive out of it is that it is proof that computers will never replace people.,If they are astute enough or hire someone who is, the feedback page(s) can be hacked, altered and overlaid.  I actually had my one of my listing pages overlaid with a photo of something else completely.  When you clicked on the “add to cart” something else was added.  The main photo was not even similar to my product and did not come from my pool of photos.  So while computers will not replace people, very smart people can do awful things with automation.  By the bye, I opened a case.  It was “referred” indefinitely.  For over a year, I got emails that it was being worked on and I would hear back “soon,”  When I opened a case about those, both cases were closed.  Best you can do is choose your battles, especially if your ability to make a living depends on it.,I have to agree with this others that you should leave it alone and not poke the bear. It’s unfair. It stinks. It’s absurd. However, the Amazon bear is a mean bear. Leave him alone. People that use unfair practices always get a way with it for a while, but eventually, it comes back on them. It might not be for some time, but it will happen. In the meantime keep doing what is right and fair and honest, and you will reap your rewards. Take care!,Funny how you can tell which sellers are getting their feedback removed. They’re the ones who reply with comments like ‘Don’t Worry About What Other Sellers Do’. Unless honest sellers poke the bear, nothing’s going to ever happen and these other sellers will get away with wrongfully having their negative feedback removed. Feedback is feedback and buyers want to know the honest truth about the seller and the quality of their product.,This happened to me as a buyer.  Vendor deserved a negative feedback and somehow he got it removed. I give feedback all the time. I usually do it for Good Karma (so i get some myself ) very rarely i give a negative feedback,turning new leaf,
I left them a negative and saw they were piling up negatives and going down down down.,
they were claiming they shipped items which they hadnt  and then canceled to save their metrics,hoping the buyer wouldnt notice the book hadnt  arrived.,
I will never buy from them again,Who really cares - just run your own business.,Seems like they have a connection on the seller support side that is doing those removals for them. There is NO WAY and i mean it NO WAY you can get all those buyers to remove their negative feedback’s and there is NO WAY seller support will EVER remove all those simply by opening request after request. I’m guessing the guy has a connection within the amazon employees where he perhaps pays money or not, but he gets his account pampered. This should be reported and this guy should be banned from selling.,
And don’t listen to the other sellers, look at your account.,
We are looking at our accounts but we cant sit quiet when a crook is abusing the whole system. So we play by the ridiculous rules and fight for every review and someone gets to cancel orders left and right and not even get stamped with a negative?"
Sellers remove negative feedback without buyer's consent,"Selling on Amazon,Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns","Wow ! its back ?,do you have any idea how they do that ?,Interesting question. Clearly the issue, if it is at it appears, shows disparate treatment for neutral or negative feedback removal. If true the disparate treatment would disadvantage other sellers and as such it would affect their business and it is of their concern. After reading this question I wondered if the account that posted this question receives special treatment , knows they are given an advantage over their competition, and therefore feel they have an interest in deterring effective dissent. .,How do you know that?  You can’t know, unless you try.,And no, I wouldn’t start with SS.,Literally last week my listing got removed instead of updated as requested after I reported an unidentified person for changing the picture of my shampoo to a perfume now I have to go though the appeal process to get my listing back up (I did not sell any units while listed as a perfume),First of all, how do you know they haven’t had a correspondence with the buyers and worked everything out with them to get them removed. Second of all it is extremely easy to get feedback removed if it has nothing to do with the actual seller or his account.Also if the negative feedback are from a  competing seller it is easy to get them removed once you can prove it.,All available evidence suggests that this is precisely how it is accomplished; a great deal of ink has been spilt on this type of manipulation in certain MSM, governmental, legal, internet security, and eCommerce circles over the last decade.,But the bottom line remains what it usually is:,“Money Walks…”,So I guess you’ve never used the “request removal” button in your feedback manager? It automatically removes feedback that doesn’t comply with Amazon’s policies. It is automated and imperfect. If the feedback is a product review, then it will be automatically deleted.,NOT in , instance.,As you astutely mention, the Feedback Manager Amabot remains…imperfect.,They are able to remove it without the buyer’s consent. They are all valid feedback from the real buyers.,
If you read their comments, It seems impossible to persuade them to remove their feedback.,
They were deleted within hours.,Do you mean , or , (OP)? ,Look not for hope or fairness to compete on amazon . You will find no hope here,WAYYYYYY too many sellers focus on seller feedback. Outside of the Amazon metrics for performance and getting suspended, seller reviews are pointless. This isn’t ebay, where sellers accounts matter to buyers.,Unless you are a small seller, the seller review process is junk. We have sellers with a 40% negative rate but they still win the buy box for a penny on the same item, despite our 8000+ 5 star reviews, so don’t waste your energy or profits cleaning up negative reviews. Follow the old adage “you can please some of the people…” you know the rest. Amazon and other retailers, only enable people out there actively searching for something to be outraged about, to get refunds, discounts or complain. Only take action on things you actually do in error and for the rest, pretend you work at “seller support” and reply with cut and paste statements to a random Amazon policy.,Oh come on.  You know how they get the feedback removed.  It’s called an inside job.  Get one.,more screenshots of another seller,
,I know this is going to hard to hear for the first time in your life, but life is not fair.  And Amazon is really not fair!,Their feedback now,
,So many seller poor respond, i wonder if this would be happening to them if they would be AS CONCERNED ! Sometimes i see no help here, rather just DETER-ANT by replies. If this person is wasting their time talking about their problem because they want to understand it why do the replies need to be so negative also if he or she is wasting there time following a lead , arent you wasting your time replying ? LOL ,Dare I say it?,
Could be $$ changing hands to AMZ employees who have access to feedback data-or could be employee(s) who own the business.,From what I’ve read, lower-level employees-or those not located in the U.S.–aren’t paid particularly well. Enough to keep 'em honest? Only JB and the powers-that -be know…,more examples if you still have doubt,
,Have to agree. OP’s concern is valid. Looks sketchy."
Sellers remove negative feedback without buyer's consent,"Selling on Amazon,Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns","This glitch (or whatever) has been going on since 2018 (maybe earlier). I thought it was gone in 2019 but I was wrong. My competitors from Texas are able to remove all their negative feedback. They have about 30 accounts that I have identified. Here are some screenshots,
,more screenshots of this seller,
,more negatives later,
,more negative,
,Tens of negative or neutral feedback were removed each week. The above example is just one of these sellers. It is not possible to compete with them because of their super power on Amazon. Any suggestion other than opening a case with Amazon because I opened tens of cases.,You need to stop worrying about what other sellers are doing and concentrate on your account.,Seriously Seller support won’t do anything about this. There are legitimate ways to get feedback removed (and there are ways that are policy violations), but “telling” on another seller to seller support won’t end well for your account. Seller Support is stupid enough that they may shut your account down because they think you are the one violating policy.,Business perspective .,
Use your amazing energy - and Be focused on ‘your’ business that will actually profit you - rather than burning that energy to investigate your competitors accounts which will not do you anything.,I actually want to know how they are getting those off too.,i dunno…isn’t this indeed affecting the OP’s business? So in effect, they ARE worrying about their own business?,Would be nice if the mods could chime in and tell us why this is happening, if it is indeed allowed somehow by Amazon?,it’s painfully clear to me that Amazon would not remove those feedbacks from MY account…,I have no clue how they are removing those feedback, but in the end it shouldn’t be your concern. If they are doing something wrong, then Amazon will eventually catch them. You have put a ton of effort into putting together all this information and tracking this seller. Who cares? You’re wasting your time tracking and complaining about this person, put that time into your own business instead to make productive use of your time.,I hear you and feel your pain. Removing negative feedbacks to pretend that they received more positive than negatives reviews is cheating and lying to themselves, and it affects all of us, sellers, directly and indirectly, however I do believe in God’s justice and soon or later those dishonest sellers will ripe what they planted. Let’s focus on doing our best job and providing the best products to consumers and we’ll also ripe what we planted. Good sales to all of you! God bless you!,Are you willing to gamble that SS will understand your question and not suspend you?,We sell the same products. They dominate the pages with multiple accounts. Their feedback scores get better and better due to their feedback removal power since September 2019.,Two sellers with the lower feedback score are not them. No buyer would buy from them,Perhaps, rephrased a little but essentially saying the same thing: Worry about things that are within your control to fix.,This ain’t one of them.,What I’m curious about is how do they have the shipping performance displayed?,
This is the first time I’m seeing this and upon checking just now, I don’t see these metrics displayed for anyone.,
Does anyone have more information?,I agree, focus on your own account, and perhaps notify seller support if you have ‘proof’ they are all the same seller, but I agree, they will probably do nothing. On another foot, I did get what seemed like a bulk email for a seller (not this one, unless they’ve changed their name), asking me to remove the feedback. The link they put in the amazon email ( was very careful) I clicked, just to remember what I’d ordered and why I was unhappy, when I clicked the link I got a screen from Amazon that said “thank you for changing your feedback on item blah blah”. There was no choice, they had sent me a link that automatically sent me to a specific page further down the 'do you want to change your feedback"". I was blown away. This was maybe 4 months ago, so there is some manipulation going go.,Possibly some extension OP is using? If you check out turningnewleaf’s seller profile page, it isn’t there.,I totally agree with major. Stop focusing on your competitors and use that energy to put more effort in your business. Not trying to sound mean, but i have competitors that will leave 1 star reviews on my product page. Do i go back and do that to them, absolutely not. I will not focus on them and only focus on myself and how to better myself and my business. Because at the end of the day they are not making the money for you.

What is up with the constant error messages, and how do I make this change?,Start with just changing your returns address.

Restock limit,Selling on Amazon,"My ipi was above 450 on week 51 2020 why do i still have restock limits when amazon said that there will no longer be subject to volume limits,Restock limits and volume limits are 2 different things.,Restock limits are ASIN-specific and can be found on the Restock Inventory page. You’ll see how many units you’re allowed to send in for the ASIN you search for.,Volume limits are for all your inventory and can be found on the bottom of the your IPI page. Click “Storage Volume” on the bottom of the IPI page and it’ll expand to give you more details.,My storage volume is UNLIMITED from 1/1/2021 onwards, but I still have limited restock volumes. What is the point of having unlimited storage volume and not being able to send inventory?,The point is that Amazon FCs are (or have been until very recently) almost at capacity. As your products attain sales history, you’ll be able to restock them in higher quantities, so having unlimited storage will greatly benefit you mid and long term.,100% agree with Masons_Treehouse.  Who cares if the storage limit is a big number if the restock quantity is a tiny one?  How are we supposed to improve our sales history if we can only stock 200 units at a time?  We’ll just go out of stock with a hard marketing push.,I’m sympathetic to the immense pressure Amazon must be under right now, but the correspondance they sent out was extremely poorly worded if restock quantities haven’t actually changed.,I agree.,Answers, Pivot and Adapt!  Make a MF listing for each of your FBA listings and be ready to ship MF whenever your FBA goes out of stock while you ship in new stock frequently to FBA as the system allows."

We have 2 ASINs that are the same product but one is a discontinued pack size.  Will it be possible to merge those to remove the confusing discontinued pack size?,Wait 24-48 hours and check again.,
Many of the servers are way behind.,Before you try any merge - Make absolutely sure that the Brand names are Exactly the same. Just because the product may look the same, and have the same title, doesn’t mean that another seller has Branded it, or re-branded it.,Just to clarify we’re the Brand Registry brand for both pack sizes that should be merged.,I guess I’ll try it at some point, but it’s rather scary that no one seems to indicate it’s ever actually worked."

I can’t change it.,So, I just wondered what is used to define the ‘Brand’ part of your listing? It’s as if part of the system has updated but not all.,You are correct in the fact that you cannot change the listing.,
If the listing show n/a or generic, you will not be able to change it.,

On eBay as long as it isn’t 100% a felony for sure it is good to go, and customers are never sure what they are buying. On Amazon customers expect brand new, never been used latest and greatest.,I have reviewed this thread.,You were asked to prove authenticity of a Toyoya/Lexus part.,What specifically did you do in response?,the account was suspended before I could provide evidence of anything,Hi ,–,My personal recommendation to you is to hire an Amazon account reinstatement specialist, for three reasons:,I am not saying this to be unkind. I sincerely believe that this is the right step for you and your situation, and wish you the best of luck. , To be clear, hiring a specialist does not guarantee reinstatement. I think that , and , are correct that your chance is minimal at this point.,Your account was suspended 4 days after they asked for proof.,Amazon wants businesses, not people doing it for a hobby. You are required to respond to customers within 24 hours. Which means you must check in with Amazon every day. There are no days off.,Four days is ample time for you to respond to such a serious violation. You managed to send appeals right away, but could not manage to send invoices? Or respond in some fashion?,Nope, you did not deem it important. So Amazon, since you were on a short leash already, did what they should have done, and suspend you. Twenty appeals with just the tracking number probably ended your hopes of ever selling on Amazon again. Good luck on Ebay.,Ebay is not bad, no where near the sales numbers, but they now account for about 60% of my profit, where they used to be 10%. I agree they are more seller friendly. Amazon has become the big leagues, while Ebay is the minor leagues. Couple mistakes on Ebay, oh well. Couple mistakes on Amazon, see you later.,I agree with racing. You are done with Amazon, good luck getting to talk to a human about your problems, not going to happen.,yes this is why amazon is the worst there is no way to be perfect without a human looking at problems,The people who feel this way tend to be the ones, like you, who don’t seem to understand how their problems came about or what , role was in it. I’ve been selling here for 15 years and don’t have the same problems with Amazon that you do.,You messed up. Learn from it and move on.,I have lots of complaints about Amazon. But they have been fair for the most part to me.,Couple years ago, I had a product suspended similar to yours. The Brand Owner filed a IP complaint, and Amazon sent me a nice performance notification and deactivated my listing. I still did RA back then, but was in process of weaning it out. The difference is in the steps I took.,I immediately put my account on vacation, deactivated all listings, put in removal orders for the products I could not prove authenticity of, and wrote a POA to the deactivated listing saying this, and I was reviewing AMZ policy and so forth. Took about a week off, then reactivated all the stuff I am authorized to sell on Amazon. Never heard a peep out of AMZ.,I consider myself lucky, but I took immediate action. If you have heartburn with AMZ, do not sell on here. Plenty of other platforms to make a living off of. Amazon is a headache at times, but for the most part, if you follow their rules, there is not a problem.,Best of luck to you.,You are not listening and I will not waste my time on you if you continue to act this way.,You were asked to provide proof of authenticity.  You were suspended because you did not,You sold something in a category that has lots of problems.,You came here for help.  If you will not answer my questions, I will not help you and neither will many others.,not sure how you are helping if you aren’t an amazon employee? what do you want again and how will it help?, is a Forum expert on account appeals. They are offering to help you. This is a great opportunity.,what is a forum expert?,Ok, ok…the joke is on me… "
Can't get a human to fix double suspended account,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","ok fine but I already sent the jan 25 notice,
,Package didn’t arrive,Order was never received,January 23, 2020 Tracking ID 9300120111404203367784,and heere is the dashboard,The dashboard doesn’t tell me anything because violations fall off after 180 days.,Look this order up and figure who shipped it and where it was shipped from.  The tracking information origin scan might give you a clue.,Have you shipped any orders yourself?,Did you sell a pirated copy like the customer stated?,Where did you get it?,that order was shipped with FBA and USPS by amazon,
i shipped a dozen orders myself using amazon shipping always but it didn’t do anything to protect the account,
i didn’t sell a pirated dvd just put the dvd in a different case to ship it and the buyer called it pirated because they wanted a free movie. i do this all the time on ebay but i can show pictures on ebay of the box and amazon makes you use the amazon picture of the item to list it. i don’t think this has anything to do with the kick because it was kicked only 4 days later,Do you mean shipped by you using Amazon Buy Shipping or shipped by Amazon FBA?,it was shipped by me using amazon buy shipping,What is the ship by date on the order page?,When was the first scan by the USPS (Not the date you purchased the label)?,What was the deliver by date on the order page?,Click on the tracking information link and send a screen shot.,OK, the tracking has expired.,If you shipped this on time, you should have appealed the A-Z claim.,i lost the appeal,Only if you list in New condition.,Which clearly that wasn’t – so offer specific images are allowed.,i usually open them and make sure they are not cracked but yes it technically wasnt sealed new and was just like new and they got a free dvd because of that,Any appeal should be in the following format:,Root cause:,
What I have done to fix the issue:,
What I have done so that the problem won’t happen in the future.,Appealing a suspension with just a tracking number won’t work.,At this point, I’m not sure how to word this appeal.  Hopefully, an AHT Mod or another seller will help., , ,yes, a human would be oh so helpful here.,
so what was I supposed to say to amazon other than what I said in january and nobody even looked at:,the account been deactivated in error?,
The A-z guarantee is attached in which A-z policy was not followed. Please,
review proof and reverse this decision.,Since the tracking information is expired, I can’t tell if you shipped this on time or not.  If the first scan wasn’t done in the shipping window, then that could be why Amazon held you responsible for the A-Z claim.,If this claim was the only reason your account was suspended, then a good appeal should get your account re-instated.,Because there was more to your ODR greater than 1% than an item shipped FBA(well maybe not FBA) that was delivered but not delivered. The counterfeit complaint is completely different than the item noit received AtoZ claim. two separate orders.,So did you list it as new? Or like new?,Which appeal? Did you appeal the AtoZ claim? Or are you talking about account suspended appeal?,I think you really need to visit seller university and learn about the Amazon platform. If you do not know the difference between FBA and FBM, and if you listed it as new, then if your account is reinstated it will only be suspended again because of your knowledge of Amazon rules and policies.,You still need to look thru the replies to your appeals and see if you got the kiss of death. If you got that, then your account is likely done for.,You can also work on a proper POA for one last hail mary attempt at it. I would post it here first for review before sending.,You need to figure out why you were suspended before writing the POA. I think you have multiple issues you need to address, but only you can figure that out."

now that was the reason and here is what you asked for it says ODR that is what you get when something is not delivered,I think the first step is for you is to figure out why your ODR was greater than 1%.,Second step is to find your latest appeal letter you sent to Amazon.

Post the last response you got and the POA you sent in to get it.,there was never a response to any of them,I am just guessing here. But since you had a listing removed January 21st. I would imagine you did not respond to a request Amazon sent for proof of authenticity. They waited 5 days then suspended your account.,And then you burned up twenty appeals not addressing the reason for your suspension. Blaming Amazon for the problem.,Somewhere in that minefield of appeals, Amazon sent a similar response to the others, except with the kiss of death, “we may no longer respond”.,To anyone new to Amazon, first step when your account is suspended is to not send in an appeal. First step is to figure out why you were suspended. Second I would search the forums for similar issues. Third I would post the suspension letter, what I did to get suspended, and tag a few of the knowledgeable people I found in my search for similar suspensions. It does nto take too long to come up with 3 to 4 people here who truly help those who truly want to be helped.,After getting feedback, and some buy in from the group on your appeal, cross your fingers and then hit send.,the reason for second suspended was a-z claim said not delivered and i somehow lost the appeal after providing proof of delivery. amazon skipped all communication steps and just became a brick wall after this because there are two appeals that are causing errors. a human could see and fix this but there is no way to get that far.,I’m sorry, but Amazon isn’t going to ask for proof of delivery for something FBA.  Your story isn’t making sense.,Have you fulfilled any orders yourself?,Please post the notice sent to you on January 21st.  Nobody can help you until you do this.,not sure what is confusing but here is what you asked to see,We have removed your listings because of a buyer complaint about the authenticity of an item they received from you. If you have FBA inventory of the items causing “inauthentic” complaints, they are currently ineligible for removal. The listings we removed are at the end of this email.,If you do not appeal this decision in 90 days, any FBA inventory of the item that caused “inauthentic” complaints may be destroyed at your expense.,This is not the whole notice.  It should tell you what they want you to provide in your appeal.  How did you respond to this?,they never sent it back, I never had a chance to appeal that or anything else. the next and last thing they asked for was the jan 25 suspension notice about ODR,Look up your A-Z claims here:,What was the reason for the A-Z claim?,Have you fulfilled any orders yourself?,Do you have any negative feedback?,Your ODR wasn’t high because an FBA order arrived late.

Any e-mail or telephone? Does anybody know?,Please let me know.,Pedro,Isn’t this where the carriers have been omitting scans due to package volumes?,I suspect Amazon are well aware of the carrier problems in recent weeks.

Buy box percentage went down (I’m the only seller),"Selling on Amazon,Help For New Sellers","So I noticed today that my buy box percentage went down. The product is 100 percent created by me so it’s impossible for someone else to have my product to sell. I also only have 1 active listing for it.  I called seller support and they basically told me that the system isn’t giving them a reason and they can’t disclose any more information.,What could be the explanation? Is this an indication of something black hat happening?,Check for bad feedbacks, slow delivery, customer complaints, bad reviews, late shipments, etc.  I believe all these also will be a factor.,We manufacturer our own products.  Don’t worry about it.  Amazon’s algorithms have no idea how to treat a single seller of a unique item.  The entire site is configured around resellers competing against each other.,I’ve learned that Amazon, seller support and even 99% of the very helpful people on this forum have no idea how to treat manufacturers.  A few months ago, I found out how bad it’s become in younger generations… I had to explain what a machinist is at such a dumbed-down level it made me both confused and sad.  Machinists (and tradesmen in general) used to be respected just a few generations ago, and now young people don’t even know they exist.  And I’m only in my early 40’s!,All of my stats are excellent. Regardless, I’d still be the only seller, It’s nice to be able to relate! I’ve spent countless hours trying to explain I didn’t buy the product off of a shelf to SS. While speaking on the phone with a ,  SS, they explained that you just have to give them your website (product on it) and explain— “hey we’re the same entity.” Then it clicks!,The BB percentage is inaccurate and something I ignore as the sole seller of unique items. While it is true Amazon will at times remove the BB for unique items sold by a single seller, often in an attempt to steer sales to other more profitable products for Amazon (mostly FBA), it’s impact on sales is limited if you are the only seller. Furthermore, the reported BB percentage is a lagging figure if even accurate at all. Because of the mess with USPS, I set product inventory to 0 and days later Amazon was still reporting I had 99% BB coverage.,Interesting. Thank you for your response. Mine currently says 96%. I’ll just chalk it up to inaccuracy as you said."

I have reported it twice. I called seller support multiple times. All seller supports agreed it’s a misuse of variation by this Drem-Wardrobe and had my listing freed from this Drem-Wardrobe’s newly created variations.,yes , your listing was back to normal today , tomorrow your listing will be changed again by Drem-wardrobe or 5 of your listings or 10 of them will be merged and changed by Drem-wardrobe , or other sellers will be affected  by him. Seller Support is really great  in helping me with my listing too , but we are here to figure out  how this hijacker despite 100 of violation reports are steel operating doing the same things over and over and seller performance doesn’t care . But if you report the violator suddenly you get  violation warning and your own listing is taken down .,
Suddenly Amazon Policy doesn’t exist for some Chinese sellers .,This is the worst part. And this is very discouraging to our good sellers.,My listing was ok. But my sales and rank were dragged down. I never got a single sale when this hijacking happen. Usually, I got orders soon after seller support fix the issue. But mine is an item for Christmas so missing a few day of sales in Dec is really bad., has 50% lifetime positive feedback and hijacks 10’s of thousands of listings every day and is still an active seller.,It does seem like some are more equal than others."

Amazon is completely corrupt.,Several years ago it was possible to get the catalog people at Amazon to lock listings so they could not be changed.  I had this done when one seller kept changing the title of a book to the wrong title.  I figured the other seller had the wrong title in his flat file upload and it was constantly being changed after being corrected.,I don’t know if it is still possible, but it worth a try to talk to the catalog group.,As I understood from my conversation with SS  you can have your listing to be “locked” if your brand is registered with Amazon Brand Registry .,

– Changing the parent product’s detail page so it does not match the children.,I checked almost All listings of this Drem-wardrobe - they all were stolen from different sellers and exactly hi is uploading somehow his corrupted  file - first he changes the titles , then he adds the variations and then our listings became his listings with our 100 5stars reviews . Wonderful isn’t it. And it is all happening right in front of my eyes - my listings change one after another,

But you’re right:,All my listings are stand -alone. All of them , they all was hijacked without problems,Maybe it’s also time for some private messaging among similarly victimized sellers. I remember OP’s last thread about this and it is just awful.,Perhaps a group approach to what’s happening here will alert Amazon to the extent of the problem and the total annual fees contributed to the coffers by such a group.,Honest USA sellers like us are notoriously BAD at banding together and making a difference.  My custom $174,000 product in yearly sales have been hijacked, co-opted, for reviews and subsequently deleted by Amazon in favor of the Chinese jacker.  Not the first one, not the last one I believe. I do not understand why are we so incompetent to band together and make a difference.,
I am all game to work together, I just ran out of hope… back in 2018. PM me if I can help and participate.,You might try to take a step back and approach this differently.  I know nothing about what I am going to say … this was told to me.,One of my suppliers went through “Brand Registry” … I don’t know how they did it, or the hurdles that they went through.  They told me that they did this because they then controlled the product listings and could limit who did and did not sell their products.  If you are private label or even just create your own, brand registration is relatively easy if you don’t pick anything close to an existing product brand.,If you spend the effort (or at least look into) that solution, you might be able to prevent future hijacking.  I have no idea if this would work, just offering it as a possible solution.  People on here hijack all sorts of listings and this should be impossible if Amazon managed using UPC coding and GS1 information … the best is when it is your product, you generated the GS1 listing, and Amazon argues with you.  Delete product, assign a new UPC code, re-label, then relist is the only way to get the system to work properly.,I agree with your idea. But on global level thousands of sellers will be unprotected from hijacking here on Amazon. In the other hand here is one simple solution- you created any listing - you own it.,
Nobody can modify your listing . Wouldn’t it solve thousand of problems at once ?,
In jewelry category however there was FOREVER Amazon policy itself - nobody can list under existing listing in jewelry category , each seller must create his own listing. Based on this seller must feel protected without a branding his listing or product. But somehow this Policy doesn’t work anymore however it still on Amazon.,
First thing when you ask Seller Support for help - they ask if you are a Brand owner …it should not be mutter according to Amazon policy in listing in Jewelry Category - your listing  is yours - this is a written Amazon Policy.,The same thing - if your listing for a man hat , somebody hijacked it and changed to TV set and  if you report it - this hijacker must be banned from Amazon forever . Without enforcing the Policy on the Amazon there will be a big chaos as more and more sellers are join website and think somehow that they can do anything without any consequences,The best advice is to move to another platform where this is not an issue.  Amazon is broken, too large, unfixable, and unconscionable.  This has become the absolute worst of all of the venues available to 3P sellers."
Mistake setting up account,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","I signed up for an account to sell on Amazon, but meant to sign up for the individual account.  I never intended to pay $39 to Amazon as I don’t know that I will sell many books on Amazon.  Until I know how this will go, I really am upset that I have been charged and don’t know how to or even if I can get this money back into my bank account.  Is there a way to be in touch with someone from Amazon to get this straightened out?,I’m in the same boat as you. I asked for a refund and got one and then I was rebilled the $39.,
I can’t seem to find a way to talk to a human and many links for “more help” seem to go to the generic “help selling an item” page. so fustrating!!!,Seller support is abysmal.  If you don’t already have a vested interest selling on Amazon, I would avoid it like the plague.  It’s just one nightmare after the next.  The system is a train wreck operated by incompetent people to the extent that it seems like malice.,Once you pass the new seller verification. Downgrade your account to individual to stop future charges. You can ask for a refund, but I would doubt they normally issue any."

Brand name change - keep ASINs?,"Selling on Amazon,Help For New Sellers","Hi All,,Sorry for another ‘changing Brand name question’ but I can’t find the whole answer.,Can I change my Brand Name and keep the same ASINs?,I am getting conflicting advice from Amazon Support.,I am the manufacturer of the item, I am the only seller, I don’t have any reviews yet and I am Brand Registered.,When I created the listing I didn’t have anything to prove I was the brand owner so I put ‘N/A’ as I was advised.,Seller Support/Brand Registry Support are telling me everything from ‘delete using flat files and reload to keep your ASINs’ to ‘you can’t keep ASINs if you change the Brand Name’.,Could I ask those of you that have changed Brand Name did you keep the same ASINs?,The weird thing is, my listing shows the correct Brand Name, but when I go to Edit inventory it is still showing as N/A.,The only reason I am trying to do this is to add A+ content to the listings. But when I go to ‘add ASINs’ they come up as ‘Not eligible’.,Any help gratefully received.,Mike.,the ASIN is Amazon’s catalog page SKU number, and you can not change it.  If you are changing the brand name, a new catalog page needs to be created with new UPC’s, and Amazon assigns a new ASIN.  Things will not transfer from the old page you do not want.   ,And yet lots of people have done just that and the pages of this forum are full of their woeful tales.,Is this a recent change of policy by Amazon?,The weird thing is, my Brand name is correct in some places and wrong in others. It seems unfair that I should lose the ASIN because of the incorrect parts rather than keep it because of the correct parts. ,I may be completely wrong but it seems I remember someone saying that once you are brand registered you can have the brand changed and also keep the same ASIN.,Seems nobody - including Brand Registry Support - seems to know. Certainly Amazon won’t do it for me. I’m pretty convinced I’m going to lose the ASINs just because part of the system isn’t working correctly. ,When you first set up a listing under a generic name - That name is attached to the ASIN assigned by Amazon. The ASIN grabs all of the information that you keyed in relating to the UPC/GTIN and your SKU. THIS becomes the ASIN.,Since you ‘jumped the gun’ and did not wait for your Brand to get registered, you cannot change the relationship of the ASIN to read other than what was originally designed to create it.,In other words, No… you will need to start over. You will need a new UPC, new SKU, and will Add a Product. Because, in essence, you need to establish a New ASIN with the new Brand Name.,I know what you have read in the forums as to - just do an upload and it will change it.,
This may work, but won’t for long. Once the bots recognized incorrect information regarding the original ASIN, it will suspend the listing. When this happens, you will need to go through the approval process all over again.,Hi Jes,,Many thanks for taking the time to write a full explanation that confirms what SELLC said.,I sense a certain degree of annoyance at having to answer yet another question like this in the ‘Help For New Sellers’ section (of course, you didn’t have to provide an answer but I appreciate that you did anyway).,At the time I set up the listing I was not aware that I was ‘jumping the gun’ as I was simply following the advice I was given. Not having a product or a website Brand Approval would have proved rather difficult. I am, of course, now paying the price not being fully conversant with the myriad of Amazon protocols.,Once again, thanks for your time and info.,That may have been me, as I’ve mentioned a time or two that we had to have Brand Registry Support adjust one of our Brand Names in our earliest years, because I allowed an employee to make a mistake in our submission.,Changes that Amazon has made in the subsequent years since then (largely on the score of combating co-opting/hijacking manipulations, methinks) lead me to suspect that the success we ourselves had in making such a change is unlikely to be easily reproducible now."
Shipping doesnt match template,"Selling on Amazon,Help For New Sellers","Im having a very hard time understanding shipping. Maybe somebody can help me out. I sold a book for $4.49. My Shipping template was set up for $3.99 shipping fee. However is the email I recieve, as well as the app, I do not see the shipping charge reflected. (See below)… I would expect to see the shipping as a debit, since when I process the shipping I still had to pay $2.77,
,Your example shows your order collected a 26 cent shipping charge from the buyer. That suggests that you have your template set up wrong.,You want to make sure you have the right selection chosen here:,
,What you want to do is use Per Item / Weight-Based, so make sure you don’t accidentally have Price Banded selected.,Then make sure you have the correct amounts entered in BOTH of these boxes. You’ll want to enter a Per Order cost, , a Per Lb (or per item) cost. You can set one, or both of these to zero, if desired. For instance, if you want to charge $3.99 per book no matter how many someone buys, set your Per Order cost to 0 and your Per Item cost to $3.99.,The buyer’s shipping will be calculated as follows. Either:,To what racingrox said, I would add that as a bookseller I recommend per item/order not weight based.,For weight based to work the weight has to be correct, which it mostly isn’t. And even if it is when you list, it could change the next day and you’ll never know.,As an example of setting the per order / per item charges…,Let’s say you want to charge $4 to ship one book, and want to add $1 for each additional book in an order.,Set the per order charge at $3, and the per item charge at $1,Thus, the shipping charge for one book is $4, for two: $5, three: $6, etc.,Not a bookseller,I have 15 shipping templates,Different items go with different templates. And a different method of calculating costs,

Some templates only offer CONUS . Others add PR,HI and AK,
1 template for items with batteries. Another for direct from the manufacturer drop ships ( we fully comply with Amazon drop shipping policy),Yes. Since I sell just books, I find that four templates is all I need.,If I sold textbooks, I might have a couple more to allow expedited for heavier books.  But as is, I am fine with just not allowing expedited for heavy books.,Thank you everyone for the suggestions.,I had my template set to “per item/weight-based”.  I had it set to $3.99 an order with no additional charge per pound. I had assumed the $3.99 would be applied to all orders as a flat rate, but apparently I was wrong. Does this sound right to you folks???,I now have added $.80 per pound in the hopes that that will fix things."

Inventory Limit 200 Changed on Jan 1st 2021?,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","Hi Guys,,Is there anyone who has their inventory limits raised from 200 units today? Is there a way to know if there will be an inventory a limit or not prior to creating an SKU?,As per the announcement by Amazon below, new storage volume limits depending on the IPI score are coming into effect.,
,
** If your IPI is 450 or above in week 51 of 2020, starting January 1, 2021, you will not be subject to storage volume limits.*,
,Thanks,,I am still capped at 200 units despite having a 695.  Hope this gets resolved quickly, as we’ve done quite a bit of prep work under the expectation of being able to send more inventory in early January.,There is a difference between Storage Volume Limits (the total space your inventory takes up) and ASIN Limits (the number of any one item you sell). From what I recall reading, the limit per ASIN is not affected by the new IPI limit.,I believe that any new SKU will have a limit on the number of units you can send in.,Yes, That is my understanding too.  There are still going to be ASIN or SKU level limits.,Thanks for the insight.  I see it mentioned in the last sentence in the correspondance now…missed it initially.  I think a ton of sellers are confused by this…how can you have unlimited storage space yet aren’t allowed to send in the quantities you need?,In other words, what’s really changed here?  I’m still don’t really get it.  I can’t do anything any differently than I was before.,Thanks for the clarification. I am a newbie. As I saw this announcement, I was hoping I could send more than 200 units of a new product that I want to launch soon. I was keeping the manufacturer wait and wanting to see how many units I’ll be allowed to ship to Amazon warehouses. In this case, how can I find out my inventory limit for a new ASIN/SKU I’ll create. Is there a way to check this out before creating a listing?,If you have only a single SKU, or just a couple, then it probably makes no difference to you. But for the seller with dozens, hundreds, or thousands of SKUs, they can now fill up their space, as long as they don’t exceed the number of units allowed per SKU.,AFAIK (and as a bookseller, I’m not affected by ASIN limits, so others may be paying closer attention), there is a 200 unit limit for any new item. The limit will adjust upward once there is a sales record established.,And frankly, unless you really know how your item will sell, you probably don’t want to be shipping in more than 200 items anyway; in some cases, even that may be overdoing it., Nothing has changed about ASIN limits. You will be limited to the normal 200 for a new, unsold ASIN until it has a history.,My “maximum inventory level allowed” was increased radically on 12/30/20.  Prior to the 30th I was severely limited to way less than a 30 day supply.  I’m now able to send in many more units - in some cases upping my “days of supply” on high volume ASINs to around 45 days.  I jumped at the opportunity and maxed out many of my SKUs hoping to get ahead of the FBA inbound tsunami. Products with low sales volume are still at 200 units.  So YES, I’ve seen a big change."

When Amazon to end the Limited Restock Inventory?,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","Anyone can advise on when Amazon might end the current limited restock inventory policy?,Maybe never.,
A seller can have “Unlimited” storage capacity but can only be allowed a certain number of a specific ASIN to be stored.,I agree, I do not see Amazon changing this anytime soon. You should make other plans. FBA is not the only third party storage and/or shipping service in the USA.,While we do not sell seasonal/holiday items, it would be more helpful to many if Amazon would look at historical sales ranking."
Do we need to report Sales Tax to home State or not anymore?,Selling on Amazon,"Hello everybody and Happy and Healthy New Year!,I searched for this topic but could not find any clear answers.,
So, I apologize if the question is redundant.,All 2020 Amazon was collecting and remitting State Sales and Use taxes on our (sellers) behalf.,Should we report this fact somehow to our Home States or not?,For the year 2019 I reported and paid Sales Tax myself, but now I have nothing to report as Amazon and Ebay paid it directly (to my best understanding) to my State (MI).,Is there any reporting, any paperwork?,Thank you for your time in advance.,The forums should not answer tax questions.,
There are way too many variables regarding your business, your county, your state, etc., that cannot be determined by a forum member.,It is advised that you contact your CPA or business attorney for the answers to your questions.,You can download a tax report from your Seller Central page, under Reports, Tax Document Library.,Contact your own state tax board.,They will let you know your filing responsibilities.,Generally speaking, states require you disclose both taxable and exempt sales figures to determine liability. Even if Amazon collected all sales tax from my sales, in my state I would still be required to file though would owe nothing. Check with your state/county for filing requirements.,Thank you for your reply.,
So, there is an option to say that tax was paid by Amazon or any Marketplace. Is it correct?,Not in my state. I must report taxable and exempt sales data. There is no separate field to disclose sales subject to the marketplace facilitator tax which includes not only Amazon but eBay, Google, etc.,Since Amazon collects/remits tax on my behalf, all of my Amazon sales are reported under exempt sales.,You should check with your state/country regarding filing requirements.,You never stated which state, but I believe all of them have a way to do this if they have passed a Marketplace Sales tax law. If it is not obvious when you go to complete the forms, give them a call or check their website.,You’ll get better forum advice if you reveal your home state (let’s hope it is not Illinois).,But you still need to contact your state tax board for a definitive answer.,For California those sales count toward total reported income, but a few sreens later they are subtracted back out with Marketplace Facilitator as the reason.,Thank you very much for all suggestions.,
I got an idea of exploring my state requirements in this regard.,My state of Indiana told me ( I called) that I was still required to file even though I would owe $0,I suggest you give your state a call,My state totally revamped their form once they passed a facilitator tax. Before it was just total and exempt sales. They have now added several more lines including marketplace facilitator sales,From Michigan(Dot)gov:,I didn’t see any special field on form 5081 to report marketplace sales separately, which is similar to my state/county. For reporting purposes, Amazon sales are reported as exempt sales.,Thank you GenGoods.,It is understood.,Consult your tax professional, this is why they are cheap.,Definitely check with your tax professional or state! My state just changed the rule and I did not know until I received a notice that I had not filed my taxable sales for a certain quarter. It used to be that my report only listed items sold and taxed within my own state. Now they have changed it where we have to list marketplace sales. I had to call someone to totally understand how I could list marketplace tax that I never received and never paid as the marketplace facilitator paid it. If things keep moving in a positive direction in the next year or two I am going to find a tax professional for filing reports and returns. I hate doing it but also hate paying someone else when I know how to do it. ,I think what confused me was because Etsy made a statement when they began doing it that we should not report marketplace facilitator tax. But I guess they were saying to make sure you don’t report it as tax you paid and owe to your state."

Sealed Factory Ink can usually be good for 10+ years, and we’ve had some work even longer.  5 years old should be no problem at all.  Epson for example seems to last forever, but Canon not so much.  Always set the Buyer Expectation correctly with the description and accurate pictures.,Personally I would also pick up some cheap inks and throw them in, so you can get full value for the item and a ,Probably not on Amazon.

2-5 years - 1 complaint - but I have a feeling they weren’t being fully truthful about it,
5-10 years - a couple complaints,
10-15 years old - no complaints, but those are usually rather cheap in a bulk lot, so if a couple out of 7 don’t work, hey, you only paid $30 for the lot, so who cares.,
I haven’t owned an inkjet printer since the 90’s, so I have no idea what to even expect out of them, except paying way too much for ink, with a slow print speed and relatively crummy quality.,

Expired Printer Ink help,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","Hello everyone, I am new to selling on Amazon but I’ve heard that they are quite the stickler for rules and one false move to a new seller could mean big trouble.,
I recently found a brand new sealed mini photo printer that comes with a small ink cartridge. The printer is obviously fine since it’s still sealed in the box, but I am worried if the ink it comes with being expired. Would that lead to problems or is that something the buyer would expect given that it is a bit of an older printer. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks ,Amazon is not a good fit for this type of a product.,You will run into problems selling ink for older products.   Amazon sort of requires the shelf life of these products be dated with at least 6 months remaining.   ,Depends how old the printer  it is.  Don’t attempt to sell expired inks.,Usually printers don’t check for expired ink with the first set up of the printer. Chances are it should be alright if it is the starter ink in the box of the printer.,Occasionally inks can dry up. Typically a few years after the official expiration date. Ink more than 5 years old is not good.,You can buy the correct ink and include it with the order. Don’t open the box just pack the printer and ink in a larger box.,Be aware with printers that are no longer manufactured there is a high rate of customers that will buy it and return there old broken printer expecting a refund. I have sold printers and experienced this multiple times a week ( I am sure higher end headphones, fancy keyboards and mice have similar scamming customers),What is the emoji at the end of your posts ?,I’m surprised that no one has pointed out that you cannot sell this as 'New"" on Amazon; at best, it is “Used - Like New”,You’re better off selling it on the bay. Amazon is not the best place for one-off items.,Bet you OP is in violation of that on other items as well.,If you don’t manufacture it or get it from the manufacturer directly or from a manufacturer authorized distributor it is not a new product.,Many sellers also don’t understand that not every wholesaler is a manufacturer authorized distributor.,train2 with a colon at the start and end. ,Wait you mean even though it is still sealed in the box, Amazon doesn’t consider that as new?,If you did not buy the printer from the Manufacturer’s authorized distributors it needs to be sold as USED - LIKE NEW.,It is the train I run the Amazon site from when on European buying trips.   It also means I place it there, not a person I employ.   ,No, it is not new!!!,I would not chance it.  The buyer may report it.  You might try the bay where you can explain exactly what you are selling and any exceptions to the condition.,Better fit for eBay and the listing should clearly state “Ink May Be Expired”.  I would also deeply discount the asking price because of it.,If you list this on Amazon you may run into a world of complaints and win up with a suspended or terminated account.,List it as like new and test the ink beforehand,Ink is not that expensive just include new cartridges . List it as used like new . An older model printer can be sold at more than MSRP plenty of people would like to replace their broken gadget with the same item they had before.,
Personally If the wireless keyboard I use broke I would pay up to 2x MSRP to get an exact replacement. (I would not pay extra for a printer ),Amazon customers are not your average customer when it comes to “expectations”.  List this item elsewhere making sure you stress in the description that, since the product is old, the ink may be dried-up (or, as you say, “expired”) and therefore not subject to return for that reason.,Yup.  Not only must a new product be bought from the manufacturer or authorized dealer, it must come with the manufacturer’s warranty.  An item not bought through authorized channels no longer has the warranty.,I mean, typically manufacturers include a starter cartridge that only includes enough ink to print maybe 20 pages. So personally I wouldn’t be that upset if I bought it. However, the customer may assume the printer simply doesn’t work and return it. It’s very risky considering the high cost of shipping it and then having to pay for return shipping.,Not sure what printer you are using that the ink is “not expensive”, but typically, ink is not cheap. Very easy to spend more on ink than the printer costs in the first place."

They have multiple supervisors including ultimately, J.B.,It may have been true that they did not have an immediate supervisor present, after all this is COVID land right now…,Well the term “Seller Support” is far from the term that should be used to describe it!,You call them out of there utter lack of support interest and you get threatened with them removing your support access. . . . that’s what happened to me.,They NEVER read the cases and the “copy n paste” auto reply is sent without a moments reading of your case AND they then close the case!!!  As I discovered the one place you can re-open cases is on the mobile app, I keep reopening it every time they close it without a satisfactory answer and then I get threatened with “Reduced Support”.,All this was because I called them out on the BS service that is removals and disposals, I had a removal request open for 60+ business days for just 37pcs to be removed.  In those near 4 month I receive 4 pcs!  I am repeatedly give the “30 days is usual but because of covid it may take longer” - however in the meantime disposals . . . oh yeah they are done and dusted in the space of a few days, odd that when Amazon can make money out the disposals.,Con-Artists!,As for remove of Customer Reviews . . . ha!  They couldn’t give a sh*t I had a 1 start review left on an item by someone who hasn’t even purchased it, purely because I had an error in the list stating compatibility with a piece of kit, which was a genuine error on my part, so I corrected the listing and will they remove the that review . . . NOPE.  Even though it should NOT have been left as a review since there is a error in listing link in the listing . . .,Sometime I really do wander why I put myself through this!,Unless your request is something of the absolutely basic, basic request - i.e. just change something, Amazon Customer Support is as useless as tits on a bull.,It is the people in AMAZON causing so much distress. Mostly ROBOTS. You will be lucky if one human speaks to you & really help you,The thing is, they would have a lot more time in their hands if they actually cared enough to look deeper and correctly handle the issues they are dealing with in the first place, instead of receiving and replying to 10 additional messaged from pissed off sellers,I am so glad to see that others have noticed that as well. It is almost as if Amazon have hired the fool that did so much damage to ebay and Ebay then got the guy that had made Amazon so sucessful weird to see these 2 companies change places.,
Amazon is so difficult to sell on now everywhere you turn Amazon put up roadblocks,Amen.,No customer accountability whatsoever …,NyTimes Facebook has to face up to scrutiny, Amazon will be next.,It used to be a pleasure selling here. I used to like it, but its all gone down South.,Politics and populist sentiment are fleeting and focused. Given today’s Anti-trust announcements against Facebook. I think Amazon may have escaped, only time will tell.,What phone number did you call? I can never talk to anyone there. Would appreciate it."
"Amazon's new trick for not helping their ""partners"" and closing cases faster",Selling on Amazon,"The problem we encountered was that Walmart also does the 1 upc code per item with no concerns for Package QTY.,So when we upload in bulk thousands of items, whomever got to Walmart first set the UPC in stone even if their data was bad.,So say you have  1 can of hairspray with UPC xxxx, but someone listed it as a (3 pack) now our offer is wrong.  So we have to go though EVERY SINGLE ONE to see what was incorrectly listed in the first place and find a way to deal with that.  It’s too much work and too messy for us.,I usually answer most polls with neither agree or disagree.,
This is the one exception and I made sure to vote strongly disagree.,Seller support is an utter waste of time to deal with. They try everything they can to prevent you from asking a question in the first place or they try to frustrate you enough that you will give up.,I go straight to account > other account issues,
If I write anything that generates one of those automatic resolution boxes, i backspace write minimal info to get the case created then I write a reply indicating my issue before an auto bot agent response.,If this think Amazon is bad, Walmart’s Seller Support is almost non existent. If we did not have a rep an issue would take weeks or a month to resolve!,Right on!,Couldn’t Amazon put an ‘OK to deal with, won’t waste your time’ flag in the deserving customers’ files, that their people could refer to?,Seller Support has never been great… but lately it has become nearly USELESS.  The open ticket AI only tries to prevent you from opening tickets and gives you no override button when their “help” pages aren’t relevant to your topic.  I second the “auto response” messages for virtually every ticket that again aren’t actually trying to help you solve the problem.  When you get a human being, they show no understanding or sympathy to the problem you are trying to solve and always say “nope, sorry, refer to this page,” even when the support page or rule is in direct conflict with their answer.  Then, the new trick is close the ticket permanently and not allow you to refer to the topic again (after getting zero help or understanding) on the first pass.,Seller Support is supposed to be here to help Sellers problem solve issues.  They seem to forgetting that mission.  And try to just close tickets and hide behind rules as they suit them.,We need the ability to bypass the AI, ask for a new rep and escalate an issue when the front line can’t comprehend or has their hands tied.,I think Amazon should set up different ‘help’ groups to handle individual as against professional/FBA sellers. Our problems are often quite different.,Having this issue too!  They keep saying that they can strike through feedback for FBA issues but then refuse to do so!  Bad recent change in policy.,Oh for sure, but that would defeat the purpose of having that sort of first “filtering” of responses.  In order for them to make that distinction and flag cases, a human would have to still be the one to read the first correspondence.,This is just my speculation though.  I have no idea what their internal processes are.  Maybe they do have different escalation paths after the second or even first correspondence from sellers.,I fantasize about starting our own online marketplace with lower fees for sellers and better customer service. Amazon needs a wake up call. They’re holding our funds for two more weeks, even though we had no control over our delayed metrics from Covid. What a bunch of crap.,amazon only cares for amazon products and cares for gaint sellers. seller support has not responded to my account since last 2 years.,You didn’t answer my question.  While “checking a box” is funny, it misses the point.,You said:,What I asked is how can an Associate deem a case answered by them when they ask the seller to send them information?,You are suggesting that an Associate who requests information to process the case believes the case answered, even though all the Associate did was request information and in no way respond to the case (I am giving you the long version of my previous statement to make sure there is no misunderstanding).,I interpret the Associate’s actions as deceptive, since marking the case answered makes it less likely the Seller will see the case within the time stated by the Associate and respond.  The Associate is discouraging further attempts to get the issue resolved, independent of whether or not the issue has merit.  It is a degree worse than just churning and creates a false record of performance for the Associate.,My question is genuine - since you do not agree with my interpretation, I want to know your interpretation.  Maybe you see something I missed.,So again, how does an Associate deem a case answered when they haven’t responded to the case and have asked the Seller to reply with information?  It has happened enough times with different Associates that it happening by accident can be ruled out statistically.  If this isn’t deception, and an accident is statistically unlikely, what is a plausible reason why an Associate would do this?,I very much look forward to your response.  Thank you.,Similar dream here.  I even bought the URL OnlineBoutiqueMall for just such an occasion.  Then I got very sick for a year, so I haven’t done anything yet :(.  Someday…,Lol I also own Handcraftedness and ChainmailleUnleashed.  For a future day well down the road…,I have had similar trouble, I have had a case open for over a month trying to get someone to read it correctly and reply to it! I have received two separate automated notifications that they were going to reply in “2-3 days” and have received nothing. Hoping for the best, expecting the worst (more delayed time and aging of inventory ,),My most recent case was because  we received an email from Amazon about an automated refund for a returned item…nowhere in the subject line OR body of the email did it reference an order number…only a dollar amount, so I had no idea which order was being refunded or if it was actually returned to us. I opened the case requesting clarification as to which order they refunded…their reply from seller support stated that in order to open a case and have it investigated, I had to include a valid order number …oh the irony. The worlds largest corporation with the WORST seller support.,The next great frontier in out-doing Amazon might be for some company to use Shopify as a foundation, but offer a layer above that of a marketplace for sellers. If they did it for a specific area (e.g., cookware, or cellphones), and were actually knowledgeable about it, it would probably work even better. Besides crap support for sellers (the smaller the seller, the worse the support, apparently), Amazon’s other great weakness is offering so much stuff combined with a poor search function. It makes it easier for counterfeiters, and makes it hard to find exactly what you want and get the best price. Because of the cancerous proliferation of listings for some items (e.g., toner cartridges), I’ve had to make multiple listings for exactly the same item, sometimes many listings. Just yesterday I got a higher price than usual for something, because the buyer picked the higher priced listing.,You could even organize something like this as a co-op, rather than a standard for-profit. It would be much more in the original spirit of the internet.,When I mentioned the huge number of different listings for the identical item, the Seller Disservice rep told me to report them. I replied, “I will, if I get compensated for my time, especially since I don’t sell that item any more. It’s in Amazon’s interest to get rid of duplicates and make it easier for buyers to find stuff and pay for it.”,It’s worth making repeated attempts by replying to the previous canned response. After a few messages, the problem seems to get bumped up to a human. This has worked for me (and others) more than once.,…anddd we just got our account suspended. They didn’t even bother to read the supporting documents. Let’s see how long it’ll take for us to get any resolution.,Being funny was the point. I am not interested in reading your thesis on the subject. I already addressed the point earlier. Take care,I’ve sent in cases. Wrote to them and also talked with them over the phone explaining that the feedback the customer wrote meets all of Amazon’s policy for feedback removal. Amazon Seller Support states that they cannot remove the Feedback and that a different department handles those cases. I asked for a number or e-mail address and they told me there is no way to contact them. Only way to contact them is to open up cases and every time I open up a case I get the same response."
"Amazon's new trick for not helping their ""partners"" and closing cases faster",Selling on Amazon,"I agree, they have lost a customer to rip me off and keep the product and gave them back their money I am so sick of this I am taking everything off the site I will not tolerate,In-Con-Ceivable!!!,Dream on.,These are recycled polls that have appeared dozens and dozens of times.,Perhaps not all people see them all the time, but these are NOT new polls.,And no matter how you vote, nothing changes.,I agree to some extent with what you are saying. I’ve seen a lot of businesses go belly up. Amazon is the game that has kept many of us alive. It goes the other way as well. We have kept Amazon going with 3rd parties being able to supply items Amazon could not ship out since they were focusing solely on essential items.,This doesn’t mean we have to roll over and let them dish it out. When we complain a lot and it starts leaking out to the general public they do something about it. So we need to keep the pressure on them to improve their seller support and actual resolve our issues.,I’m really sick of the canned responses. The worst part about it is something they respond in a way to prevent you from reopening the case or escalating. My fees pay for the salary of these agents. Amazon charges some of the highest commissions AND the cash out on the labels they sell to us with their so called Amazon protection.,It appears the mod has removed some of the posts overnight.,
Where my image of that latest seller poll?  gone,
Where my cute gif with a cat with a toy train? gone,
,While I completely understand the sentiment (trust me, I’ve had my fair share of dealing with canned responses), I think it’s important to remember that there are…uh…questionable people from both sides.,Anyone who’s ever worked in Retail or some other customer service related job could probably agree that some customers are just dumb.  We, the sellers, are the customers in this case.,I can only imagine how many dumb questions Seller Support must get on a daily basis.  The canned responses are meant to weed out and address the issues that could’ve been easily solved if the seller had just looked up the information in Seller Central.,I agree wholeheartedly…they have zero interest in assisting their vendors…it’s really sad considering that Jeff Bezos would be nowhere without us…,Couldn’t agree more with this post. Amazon does not care for sellers.,They need to open their eyes and realize we are the reason that Amazon is Amazon.,When you’re generating a business such as Amazon thousands/millions dollars with your business, its about time they start showing some appreciation, and have some decent customer service, along with being more transparent to sellers.,If everyone keeps turning a blind eye to it, it will continue to get worse… I’m tired of the few select people on these forums who harass those who bring up legitimate concerns. People have the right to be angry, when they pay for a service and nothing is done about their concerns.,My answer is always the same with anything related to supporting the vendors…,
Strongly disagree.,Unfortunately ToughGirls is not wrong. I have experinced the same in too many occasions. However, in Amazon’s defense, with many thousands, perhaps millions of sellers, they are doing the best they can and certainly better then anyone else around. When someone else steps up and provide a serious competition, I’m sure Amazon will address the issue. In the meantime, we need to bear with it.,It uses to be very good years ago, thankfully I dont have to use their customer service very often.  The latest interchange with them was several email exchanges with canned responses, followed finally by someone that did something.  It took two days to change a picture, after a year of trying to do it the prescribed way.  Sometimes things just get too big., Our experience agrees with yours; the only problem is, we apparently haven’t cracked the code on WHICH KEYWORDS make it through the BOT-GATE to the human who might skim it.  Suggestions?,You have to be careful with that, though. There was a brief time where they , the order of the response choices, so while we were used to seeing “Strongly disagree” at the bottom, now suddenly it was at the top. You had to really be paying attention to catch it.,They haven’t done that lately, but it does perhaps show their level of desperation.,And, on a side note, I just created a case a few minutes ago, and their response this time (a new one to me) said, “We will email you within ,.”,They romoved half my listings, never told me why? And, I’m the manufacturer, trademark owner, etc. Not sure who to ask anymore. No replies and canned responses.,I feel your pain, with the case situation, however I am very confused about the partners you are speaking of.,Those are the only polls ill respond to. Same answer.,Unless you have a wide product range and sell many thousands of product, Walmart does not want you. Most of the sellers here will never qualify. Sears was a nightmare dealing with and their system for posting products was the most maddening piece of crap I ever tried to use. Finally just quit them.,Agreed, Sears system had a horrible user interface for sellers. The low volume of sales, was why we abandoned the platform. I suspect that most of the sellers advocating Wal-Mart haven’t actually read the fine print the agreed to, and are loving that Wal-Mart is eating the majority of returns and refunds right now as they operate their ecommerce at a massive loss. Let’s see what happens when Wal-Mart starts enforcing their site TOS and policies and sellers start eating the losses themselves, remember that anything bought online can be returned in store. I can’t see Wal-Mart returns be fewer than Amazon’s, nor do I think sellers will be happy with the cost of those refunds and returns. I can only imagine the condition returned products will be in, if the seller even gets them back at all. Unless the conditions have changed, Wal-Mart is not obligated and required to send the returns back to sellers and if they do it is at the sellers expense.,Sorry, he made his point. You are the one who is not seeing it."
"Amazon's new trick for not helping their ""partners"" and closing cases faster",Selling on Amazon,"You are not being held prisoner.  It makes zero sense to stay.,i chatted 3 support and reply the same thing. and then close my case.,I agree, my cases are usually closed without resolve before I even exit the Amazon site.,
When I log in to see if they are able to fix my problem, It’s just a paragraph of links and policies and referring me to the seller community with no answer, I am completely ignored.,It’s very clear the emails are not read by Amazon employees, and out of 100 issues, maybe 2 are ever solved and that’s after several, several follow up emails. They do not solve issues here end of story.,I have been on Amazon selling for over a decade and the only thing that’s changed is, it’s gotten worse.,
Unfortunately they are outsourced and most representatives are from India and other countries.,
I rarely have issues with customers, it’s mostly , getting in my way of my success.,
Some of the issues I have run across are:,
I have been scammed by customers without resolve.,
I have been returned opened and or broken items from buyers.,
I have needed product pages fixed providing detailed proof, photos and UPCs and they still won’t fix them so not only is it a waste of time and frustrating, it makes both Amazon and I look bad.,Throughout my time selling on Amazon, I have also needed hundreds of other problems addressed without resolve. I have only been slightly successful by using other e-commerce sites and trying to do the best I can.,Amazon takes out insane fees and gives us a shipping credit far lower then it actually costs us to ship, I have spoken to them about it and they state is that it all evens out… but it doesn’t.,
I have refused to partake in upgrading to business or competing for the “buy box” as nothing changes unless you keep paying Amazon and who knows if it would change then either.,I’m pretty sure the sellers with the buy box earn decent money as I have looked over Amazons product pages and in , then scroll down and look for a , that states , or something to that degree.,I have spent thousands and thousands of dollars in fees to Amazon, and it would be worth it if they treated us all equal and fixed their issues but unfortunately I just don’t make any significant money off Amazon any more. And if I’m not doing well on here, are other sellers feeling the same?,
You may ask why I have stayed on Amazon, it’s because my items are already listed so why remove them?,Also, the 1 or 2 sales I do have each month are still worth it just in case I want to eat or something.,
Do they make most of their money through selling fees, FBA costs etc.?,
Because if that’s the case, no wonder they don’t have any concern for my small sales / listings.,Another thing is they have taken thousands of items and wrote “renewed” next to them, Several sellers are able to sell these remade or fake items along with Amazon, I’m just not one of them which doesn’t bother me too much as I only sell authentic and original items but just the idea in general is a bad one.,As I read through the page, the items are not “renewed”, they are basically refurbished and not even original. They replace old labels, stickers, housing shells, screens etc. I am a huge video game seller, and Game boy seller, but they took that away from me along with thousands of other products unless I get a purchase invoice.,Can someone tell me how to get a purchase invoice for vintage and discontinued games & consoles? The buyers and fans want the real thing, not a homemade one.,I can’t count how many times I wanted to sell a brand new vintage item from the 60’s-80’s that Amazon is out of stock on but they refuse to let me list anything without getting proof which is impossible. Since most of my items are vintage, I cannot get a purchase order from companies that no longer exist.,One more complaint. Other sellers (I am assuming it’s the FBA sellers) are able to log on and change any information about the detail page. If it’s a book, they can change it to an ice cream cone and Amazon wouldn’t care,,I will randomly update my prices and I notice far too often my listings have changed whether it be photos, model numbers or titles and Amazon won’t fix it. When I contact Amazon about it and show them proof of a photo with the UPC showing them that the wrong product is listed, they do not care at all,
I see products on Amazon that aren’t even close to what;s being sold, and then customers get  angry or disappointed. These same sellers can change anything last minute so with as many items as I have, I did not have time to go through each page to make sure the product information hasn’t changed. I just leave it, wait for the complaint and then blame Amazon.,Sellers like me who refuse to give Amazon more money through FBA or upgrading my account are not able to start their own product pages which is a horrible idea. The pages that have been changed, the photos are bad and not professional and the information is usually missing or inconsistent.,
Example ( Game boy +7 games and a case). Other sellers cannot replicate that, and it makes Amazon’s site look unprofessional and disorganized,,
10 years ago, I would sell almost $20.000 a year on Amazon, now I sell maybe 1-2 items each month if I’m lucky. I can only list about 20% of my products and Amazon is losing out since they are out of stock themselves.,I saw your post and clearly needed to vent. Ironically I just glanced over at the factory sealed products on my shelf that are vintage that I wanted to sell on Amazon. Hopefully they will fix this mess and go back about 10 years to their old model.,"" You have to keep replying again again until a real person,
,
I mean skims through it"",I can confirm this is true. It can take a half dozen attempts to get an actual response that addresses the problem instead of recycling boilerplate nonsense.

(artificial stupidity) bots and reach a human that realizes that a vintage item won’t have a receipt.,They even send the warning not to send same topic/case subject.,
What a time-consuming and frustrations we sellers have~~,Challenging to sell on Walmart if they sell it you don’t,I do agree, taking into consideration all the pros and cons and the obvious great opportunity Amazon brings. This is an area which needs to be improved. You do get some really helpful support members, but equally, i’ve had issues where the response has been generic and not referenced my issue, or more annoyingly …no response on a few occasions. Whats helped me as few times has been to leave feedback using the link below the response which has triggered a more helpful reach out. But overall yes. it need some work … waiting for Amazon to get on top of this. I have faith it will improve.,I too have found Amazon is closing cases without reading them. i have opened a case 3 times now and they keep doing the wrong thing, not paying attention to the issue at hand. it feels like automated and canned responses. seller support the last few months is utterly useless. we all know Amazon is broken, has been for years. Amazon is a necessary evil as a small business, but evil none the less.,I believe this was OPs point. He is sick of Amazon’s support, or lack there of. While more of a complaint, it is also a point. Point one of conversation:  1. Amazon does not support me as a seller.,I agree you have to look for the point, but it is there among the rest of the rather rant sounding post.,Also, almost implied is a hesitant point 2. I’m ready to leave??? maybe? I’m not sure if that one is there or not? Or, the OP may have just been saying that they are hopeful competition may improve Amazon service. Either way, when an OP implores others not to attack them and then you do, it doesn’t really do anyone any good does it? Although some people just like to poke someone who is in an angry bear emotional state I guess??,ToughGirls,,There is an army of defenders and surrogates always on standby, ready to spin and defend Amazon against any comment or opinion from any third party seller that they may consider not favorable to Amazon. With time, you will find who the most notable defenders are and you’ll be able to skip and ignore their posts.,Then you haven’t dealt with amazon long enough. I have been doing this since the 90’s. THey will let customers blatantly rip you off, close down your account for no legitimate reason, hold your funds until you tweeze it out of them with a lawyer. and the list goes on. Once we got hacked it took over  a year to get that fixed. Seller support doesn’t exist.,Good post. Good point. Absolutely correct.,Amazon is treating us like a herd of cattle. If one cow is giving less milk, or need medical maintenance, off to the slaughterhouse she goes.,In Amazon’s eyes the herd became too big even with healthy cows. They have  too much milk supply. So they are thinning the herd. Even good sellers, if there is an issue, they don’t want to use resources to correct it. A generic response that does not address the issue at all and they close the case.,
What a shame.,Such a shame so many Sellers are experiencing this. Many Sellers need to understand that as long as Amazon makes money with the current Business Model, they will NEVER change unless forced.  Seller Support will only get worse.   I have a few removal orders in and they still have not shipped them to me. Some over 60 days.  Seller Support just cut and paste the same horse c r a p.  Most of the Indian based support are poorly trained, high turnover and low pay. There are linguistic and cultural thought process barriers. Most likely Amazon probably going through outsourcing contractors who have no clue.  Amazon making out like a bandit with outsourced labor. Not faulting them. Most companies do it. India may be the new China. Don’t waste your breath on these silly surveys. Same ole goofy questions. No entity on earth can force Amazon to do anything except the Federal Government.  Should be interesting to watch when congress meets with Jeff about 3rd party Seller issues. Get your popcorn ready. When selling on Amazon becomes a hassle and you are not making money with their current business model, it is time to leave and seek greener pastures with a different platform.  I do believe the Feds will eventually intervene in some capacity. Amazon has alot of congressman who are critical of them. As far as the Sock Puppets & Boot Lickers  in this forum who defend Amazon, just ignore them.  There are a few here who really know their stuff. Unfortunately, they don’t post much anymore.,I’ve been doing this for years myself. Again, for all the people who haven’t actually read when I said. I am not saying Amazon is amazing. I am saying I have always received a response. The quality of the response isn’t what OP was alleging. Just the assertion that Seller Support doesn’t respond at all. That is what I arguing against.,After opening a case, two days later and I look and it says “answered” with absolutley no explanation.  This has happened to the last 6 cases that I opened.  How is that responding to the case?,I’m wondering if someone, somewhere at Amazon is finally getting the word about 3rd party seller dissatisfaction with seller support. The last few days the polls on my seller central page were all having to do with rating their support of 3rd party sellers.,I’m betting that like me, most are giving them the lowest possible rating. I have not experienced the latest tactic you speak of but it would not surprise me. What I’m currently not a fan of is it seems to be taking Amazon an extremely long time to make good on their A-Z claims for INR’s. I buy my shipping from them, I ship on time with tracking. I’m doing my part. Over the past few months I’ve been seeing the average time for a customer to be refunded by them has gone from a few days to 2-3 weeks. I have one right now that has been under review since May 13th. That buyer became frustrated and left me the only negative feedback I have had in the last 4 years. The icing on the cake was I used the feedback manager to ask to have it removed and was denied. Asked again and was threatened with suspension.,Your experience isn’t mine. And mine isn’t yours. And that’s fine.,I agree, Amazon seller customer service is !!! CUSTOMER NO SERVICE!!!,Yes in agreement with you, the OP and much sentiment on this thread.  Amazon does not care about its sellers, its only about the end consumer being “delighted”. Its another tactic in their arsenal, to lower their costs, or to push the costs onto us 3rd party merchants. Whether you know it or not, Amazon is stealing money from you.,Auto refunds to customers at our expense, Auto denials (claims, ratings etc), Automatically not allowing you to open cases for certain reasons or on certain orders, Automatically closing new cases, Automatically closing old cases.,In addition to the above you have the:,
Canned responses that are non responsive in nature, yet wind up closing cases.,
Canned responses that require more effort from seller even when you spend 20 minutes detailing it so it couldn’t be clearer.,
Canned responses that say they’ll get back to you, but don’t (i’ve seen these repeat for MONTHS on end).,
Canned responses that reference nothing to do with what your talking about.,and lets not forget, Outsourcing and lack of training compound all of these issues.,bottom line:  If you give an inch they’ll take a mile. Check your reports en mass match them up with debits/sales/etc, stay on top of your cases and fight fire with fire. Learn from your competitors tactics (Amazon), and use the same things they do.,I tell people all the time, selling on Amazon is not some fantasy, where everything is easy. Every dollar is EARNED and FOUGHT FOR."
"Amazon's new trick for not helping their ""partners"" and closing cases faster",Selling on Amazon,"I’m having the same problem.  A customer claimed they didn’t receive their book but USPS tracking says Delivered.  I also paid for Amazon insurance, but they are still holding $43+ of my money for over two months now.  All I get from them is Under review.  So what do i do?,My new favorite Amazon problem went like this. I had a buyer write me about sending the wrong product on Fri in the middle of the afternoon. And then on Mon mid morning the person filed a case and the case was automatically decided against me.  I appealed the case, and lost. It was a simple mistake. Apparently you have 48 hours to fix a problem, but Amazon believes we should work weekends. Now I know.,I created a case this week via phone call. After explaining myself for 10minutes for something that was pretty simple, the phonecall disconnected. I didnt get a call back so I call again to try to get a clear answer. End result, I talked with two associates and I got two very different answers to the same issue.,What can be made out of that? The lack of training is significant and the predisposition to try to get a solution instead of providing a generic answer repeting  while repeting what the issue is and how they will look into it, is the norm.,By definition of “partners”, we already are.,
“either of a pair of people engaged together in the same activity”.,
Except there are many more than just a pair of us.,Recently they refunded a customer over 20 bucks for late delivery by carrier. I messaged them to see why an FBA item would get this big of a refund pulled from my disbursement for carrier being late which was out of my control. They replied twice telling me they don’t reimburse refunds issued outside of Amazon… which after the first time I told them was not the case since they refunded the customer, but they continued to ignore my question, and let the customer have not only the item, but the money too. This is why I’ve sold 7 figures on Amazon, but rarely use their platform anymore because when you are a small business you can’t afford to have money taken from you for no reason. Somehow FBA is worse than it was 5-6 years ago, and I would’ve guessed it would’ve evolved into a better place for sellers.,It’s failure that gives you the proper perspective on success.,This was discussed here about a month ago so it’s not really a “new trick,” but it , a vexing change.,Yes, with this current format, almost every time they reply, it automatically closes the case by marking it “Answered.”  This new practice is especially egregious, as others have mentioned, when they ask you for more information but then mark the case as “Answered,” so that no “Case Needs Your Attention” notice is generated., - the upside to this is that we are now provided many more feedback request links.,So this means that there are now (in my experience, anyway) , chances to leave feedback, because I get , stupid replies.,I rate each case as many times as they give me a link. One-star, straight down the list. And in the Comments box, I name names.,The prevailing opinion is that these feedback scores matter to ,, , at Amazon.,I’m sure I don’t know, but it sure feels good to leave them.,I’ve told SS and Amaz ‘stances’ before on how idiotic they are. Very frustrating when they don’t read responses or stories or reasons, etc…Clearly, they don’t care about 3P us…even they say they do–they DON’T. Always—look at the actions…,To say it’s gotten worse in the last couple of months is an understatement.,I had that too. Took 6 weeks for reinstatement after I gave them the docs they requested. Who knows if my ranking will ever recover…,It is a nightmare…but if you can manage to glide through the BS (somehow)…sales are amazing!  I do double on wmm what I do here.  Don’t stop trying, it is worth it!,I completely agree with you. I either get a copy and paste response that makes no apparent sense to my case or it gets transferred to outer space. I also want to add, i notice that if I’m not happy with their response, i won’t get a survey about my experience. Yes, it’s frustrating, but remember we are on their platform and we can easily leave.,My experience definitely agrees with this assessment. I recently had some FBA items flagged as “unreadable barcode”. They sent an image of the barcodes in question from the warehouse. Perfectly clear text and barcode on the label. When I disputed the “unreadable” flag based on the fact that their own picture shows a clear barcode, they came back with “the barcodes are faded or smudged”. Their own picture says they are liars. You can’t make this crap up ,I can give you my “findings” now. I submit numerous cases every week,  and I have not had  a single issue go unanswered.,Just because my experience is different, doesn’t mean I don’t have  any.,Good luck I hope you kill it on Shopify!,Yep. I waited 8 days once only to get a canned response.  Nobody even read my email. I replied back to that email and finally got a person 3 days later who had not the foggiest clue what I what talking about… despite me describing my issue in excruciating detail (and using small words and short sentences). I explained my situation again and they misunderstood again.,It’s hopeless.,Every case I’ve had has been handled to my satisfaction…if not always as promptly as I prefer.,
,
In 2+ years, I’ve only opened 4 cases total, with 1 of those in 2020.,
,
I wonder whether , difficulties with case responses , a function of the case itself–content, communication, presentation, etc. ,This was great advice from , about providing satisfaction ratings for Seller Support staff and bears repeating:,I agree with you. Their employees simply send you a list of rules and regulations no matter what is the problem. A customer asked for a refund and did not return our goods. And just last week, Amazon just refunded them after almost 2 months. And when we viewed our unhappiness, these ROBOTS at AMazon simply e-mailed us the same set of rules & regulations. Without SELLERS, Amazon is going down.,The case I opened May 24th, I asked Amazon SPS to transfer me to an “American.” I’m pretty sure my case got dumped in a pile where nobody will respond because I keep receiving a null update email every 6 days.,Note to self, don’t ask SPT to transfer to an “American.”,Amazon is the worst thing ever happened to me …period … and they will shut down this topic soon because forum Moderators think they can hide all this b.s"
"Amazon's new trick for not helping their ""partners"" and closing cases faster",Selling on Amazon,"I’m totally with you ToughGirls!  No information or too little, no one to talk to, send information, send information, send information, and still nothing gets done!!!  I like selling on Amazon but boy do they make your life a living hell!!!,
Micky,
PB Specials,They have new dirty trick for not refunding order as well. The machine automatically says we do not reiumburse order not from Amazon entity.,I think they are overwhelmed. I often get frustrated and wonder if they read my responses as well. Rate that CS rep with low stars, and give Amazon feedback. That being said, you have to keep pressing the issues. We also sell on W and have seen tremendous growth there, and I feel the platform has gotten better than years ago, but you need to be diverse in where you sell so you are spread out. Don’t give up, and keep your focus. Even the largest sellers on Amazon deal with the same issues.,It is highly recommended to call for support.  It is night and day different in terms of getting actual answers to problems and solutions rather than the generic email answer that does not answer the questions being asked the majority of the time.,Yeah still a nightmare.,
Their default handling time is 0-1, you have to ask permission to get longer leads time.,
They cancel orders and and don’t tell you, so we have lost a few hundred dollars on stuff where just as we where in the process of entering the tracking they cancelled the order for late shipment.,
Returns are worse them Amazon, as buyers can take any box of junk to walmart and get a refund.,Only plus side is commissions are bout 5% lower.,Good intelligent support seems to be expensive. Houzz has really good support, but they charge a ruinous commission of  18%,100% agree. Have spent 5 months trying to get our listings updated, with no luck. Amazon has nothing to worry about if Walmart is considered “competition”,Is there a phone number??? I’m in an endless loop of issues. My GS1 registered UPC is being used BY AMAZON to sell an unrelated product. So i’m now told to report a seller violation… to amazon??? I did it all, pictures, screen shots, used the word “cleave” and “product catalog department.” Reporting a seller violation doesn’t give me a case. Meanwhile, i have inventory that is stranded because they can’t fix this. For a small seller, this takes way more time than it logically should. If they handle cases effectively, they could cut the number in half. I’m sure the metrics they use to evaluate their outsource partner though is designed for “cases closed” not issues actually resolved.,Amazon now, is much like Ebay was about 15 years ago. Let’s hope that Amazon can eventually have the same level of support that Ebay does for its sellers. Amazon’s ridiculous support for seller central is well known. The way sellers get ripped off by “buyers remorse” returns is laughable.,100% agree with this!!,We’ve personally paid Amazon hundreds of thousands a year in fees and I can’t even get someone on the phone to help.,Not to mention the back end of their system is broken joke.,We’ve all had to deal with the secret “departments” that dont have phone support so they send you a canned response without reviewing the issue and close the case. Even worse is the support person who knows less than you do about Amazon.,So happy Shopify is crushing it. Can’t wait for them to put a serious dent in Amazon’s market.,Won’t happen overnight but if Amazon keeps going the direction its going its just going to become and overpriced Aliexpress/Alibaba,I am new here and trying to get through my small test round of selling. It is very difficult to figure out how to get somebody on the phone. They are trying to automate everything like Ebay used to do. One must go through quite a maze. I went in endless loops for a while until I figured it out. Also, when I got somebody, he could hardly speak English.  Good support is expensive. They save a lot by having people in the Philippines, etc  Like any support, it depends a lot on who you get. Then I have had them tell me different things.,Unable to remove negative seller feedback when the feedback is a product review and it was fulfilled by Amazon. Its as if Amazon is breaking their own policy. Seller support can no longer remove negative feedback. So I’m stuck.,Apparently 2.5 million ants need to organize…,Nothing has changed.,Apparantly, you have not filed any cases recently.  Give it a try and then report back on your findings,You must be lucky we have had 3 cases “transferred” several times and then ignored and mysteriouly closed without any response or resolution in the last month. My favorite are the two A-Z cases for non-delivery that have proof of delivery with USPS from a label purchased through Amazon yet somehow, Amazon granted them as “Amazon funded” but took the money from us anyway. Been batteling those for over 34 days now…no answer other than "" we are looking into this case"" and then suddenly today…both are closed.,I hate them. Just today I saw that a photo of a pool skimmer showed up as a main photo for one of my products. I don’t sell pool skimmers. I went to the listing and my original picture was there, the photo of the pool skimmer shows up in the public listing.,I asked “help” to fix the picture- first they wrote me back saying that since I’m brand owner I can go to my listing and change the photo. Well duh- I already explained to them that I can’t.,Then they tell me that since I’m NOT the brand owner, I can’t change the photo.  (I am the brand owner),Last week (and the week before ) I was dealing with Amazon putting the wrong barcodes on my items and sending out the wrong items to my customers.,There is ZERO help from anybody working at Amazon.,Yep, I have some of those too.,Most of the issues i’m seeing here come top-down from BR. After reading all the Feedback on this thread it sounds more like Brand registry is the problem and not Seller Support.,Brand Registry was a great idea in concept, but it was executed VERY poorly which has since left the department in a situation with far too much room for collusion.,Just today I opened a shopify account. Amazon is horrible."
"Amazon's new trick for not helping their ""partners"" and closing cases faster",Selling on Amazon,"The tactic they use on me: “We will pass this on to our internal team for review and they will get back to you.” That was months ago, then again weeks ago, and just happened again this week , There is no internal team lol,You are lucky if it is not your experience.,It is for a lot of people.,I suggested this to ,, and I share it with you in case it has affected your business.,A few things I would like them improve:,(SPT - Seller Performance Team.),*In case log, every time I tell them to transfer me to an American.

SMH,This reminds me of another forum topic I read about what FC’s are doing to FBA sellers missing/lost inventory popping up for sale on the Amazon marketplace. So shady.,Robo responses are not new, it is marking a case “answered” so that the Seller is unaware information has been requested… with a timer so that if the Seller finds it “too late” it doesn’t look like the Associate did anything wrong - that the fault lies with the Seller.  It is a purposefully devious deception, unlike the normal “benign” practice of ignoring the Seller.,Why are you filtering by active cases? According to the agent (whether right or wrong), they deemed the case closed, even if temporarily. When I go to my case log the first page it opens to is all cases. I have certainly had unhelpful agents but i don’t understand what kind of ‘dirty trick’ is going on,As I mentioned in the post you quoted, I track case IDs and content.  That’s why I could detect the manipulation (a case cannot be even temporarily closed if an Associate has asked the Seller to respond with more information, which is why this is a manipulation).,Anyone who does filter cases by “active” is more likely to “lose” cases because of the deception.,I have been selling on Amazon for 6 years (for two different companies - the current one is very new) and tracking cases to see trends.,just put important IMPORTANT (important) [important] in there. That helps to get an actual person.,You are adding a unnecessary step and then saying Amazon is tricking you. Amazon deemed the case no longer active, therefore it shouldn’t show up as active. This is not a trick,Amazon seller support is useless in 98% of the cases, wasting our time ALWAYS!,Appreciate the concern, but I’ve never had a case go un-answered. I’ve had cases not satisfactorily answered, but that’s not the OP’s allegation.,I whole-heatedly disagree because I’ve had the complete opposite experience when dealing with Amazon. I don’t always get everything I want, but I certainly don’t feel ignored.,Try working on your communication skills; it might help improve your personal experience.,Sellers are not Amazon’s partners.  Setting up a booth at a flea market does not make you the flea market’s partner either.,Perhaps your exceptions are unrealistic.  It’s just business, you don’t want snarky comments, I don’t like whining.,How does an Associate deem a case answered when their post only asks the Seller for information?,i had them merge a single item listing with a case and had a sales explosion over the weekend and they refused to even admit they did it.,I had so many cancellations i am now at risk for suspension from the defects and feedback.,I am glad you haven’t been affected by this.,Probably by checking a box,Walmart’s marketplace for sellers is a god damn NIGHTMARE. It’s no even organized chaos, it’s just chaos. They have a long way to go before they even come close to Amazon, but it’ll be nice once they do to have another large channel of selling.,It is still a nightmare. Support is non-existent and they still de-list items with no reason and there is no appeal.,I too have become extremely frustrated selling on Amazon. Like many others, it’s a great source of revenue, but the Seller Performance Team, and the Amazon Seller Support Teams are absolutely horrendous. We’ve had listings pulled offline for no fault of our own (authenticity claims / PCRP restrictions). Upon submitting more than enough supporting documents, our claims are denied a few times with no explanation or actionable steps for us to get back in good standing. The best part is when they start telling us they may or may not respond to future messages on the issue. Usually we have to submit the same pieces of supporting documents over 4-5 times with the same explanation before it gets pushed to the right person to reactivate our account / listings.  I really don’t think their teams put much effort into investigations.,We had a listing removed on 6/19 due to PCRP Restrictions. We responded immediately. No response from Amazon for 5 days. Called yesterday and this morning to follow up and was denied an hour later. Opened a new case today. ,Our product adheres to all FDA / Amazon guidelines, so the issue is not with us, but other sellers from Asia selling the non-US version of the product. We’ve sent everything to them and if they would actually read our appeals, it would be resolved immediately."
"Amazon's new trick for not helping their ""partners"" and closing cases faster",Selling on Amazon,"I’m so sick of dealing with Amazon’s terrible support.

The third is open for discussion.,I agree with you.  I am not sure how people say it’s good. Beyond incompetent and getting worse by the day.,The Point Was Clear…,It is very frustrating. They never read the email before they send canned responses. On almost every case I go back and forth with them at least 3 times to get my questions answered. I have to tell them to go back and read the original email because they clearly never did.,I just rate them on every interaction and hope that someone somewhere is looking at them and hopefully gives a damn.,I’m apparently dense. If it wasn’t “Amazon bad & all you Amazon sellers dumb (& mean). Other company best ever!”, could you enlighten me?,The only point  I would question  is the use of “new” in the title.,
Amazon has been giving Robo responses for quite a while. See Sundance post ,.,
This is the experience I have with cases, not an answer so reopen, then escalate then reopen.,Trying to even list products on there is awful!!! Has something changed?,It’s certainly true that Amazon reading skills could be improved and it is miffing that an issue that could be solved in a single exchange of emails often requires ten or more.,I suspect that if we knew what the guys and girls reading our emails get paid and how many they are directed to get through in an hour, we would be amazed that anything gets solved at all.,The more too that we hand off “communication” to bots and computers and pre-recorded messages, of course, the worse it will get.  Progress…,Amazon is our King, and we are its subjects. Miniscule and unimportant. Forget the past and the fact that we made Amazon what it is. Now we are nothing to them. Lower than dirt. We have to survive on our own in this vast jungle. Don’t count on Amazon for anything. Just do what you can and figure out the rest as you go.,You’re lucky then, I have had the same experience. They closed my case 5 times, and I currently have two open cases for the past two months about the same exact thing.,Amazon is the biggest & best thing going so if you want to be partners,

I know this is a big albatross but I’m so disgusted by getting jacked around.   My sales have plummeted here after years of working a full time job just dealing with bot, false claims, lack of customer communication and of course the Amazon Seller Support - notice that acronym?,, I respectfully ask if you noticed the trend of Associates churning the case by asking a question (often one already asked and answered multiple times) but marking the case “answered” instead of “your action needed?”,By marking the case “answered” the Associate guarantees that Amazon will not flag the seller as needing to reply to the case, and unless you track case IDs (I do), it just disappears from your active cases filter (as if hidden).  The Associates put a time limit for your reply to make you think you lost your chance for the case to be resolved.,Perhaps you noticed most of the respondents to this thread knew exactly what the OP was talking about even though the OP did not fully flesh out the initial post.,, may I kindly suggest you search through all of your cases to make sure this new nasty Associates’ trick hasn’t been pulled on you?  I am concerned for the well-being of your business., I have found various ways to re-open cases, which has been useful given this new trend.  You probably already know this, but no case is ever over until you give up.  Sure, you may not be able to reopen the exact same case, but you can open a new case and put the old case name in the title, then indicate this is a continuation of Case ID xxx that the Associate incorrectly marked as answered.  Then request they read the old case , read the case summary you have thoughtfully included along with exactly stating your desired outcome.,Once Associates learn this new trick doesn’t actually work, it will go away.  Our persistence, along with providing feedback, will eventually prevail.,I learned from a very good Associate that any Associate who gets a “No” feedback that is specific enough will get “re-trained,” which the good Associates appreciate as they are not allowed to tell anyone if there is a “training” need.  His advice was to be very specific, like… please teach this Associate that if a reply is needed, the Associate should not mislead the Seller by marking the case answered, causing Amazon to not alert the Seller that a response is needed.  Or… this Associate has continued the pattern of churning this case by requesting information that I have already provided in the format required on 3 separate occasions - clearly the Associate did not read the message before replying.  Or, my favorite… this case has been churned for 56 days, with the last Associate avoiding actually working on the case just like all the previous Associates - how can Amazon afford to waste all these expensive manhours?,I have gotten results from all three of these examples.,  I have won many a case even where I was informed policy only allowed one review of the case and the Associate refused to respond further."

I saw the tracking stopped at Dec 3 and advised customer that USPS was experiencing unprecedented delivery troubles, that package was late but mostly likely would still be delivered, in either case it was insured, please sit tight, we will continue to monitor, he won’t lose, etc, and that Amazon customer service was available 24/7.,Customer contacted several days later to let me know it still did not arrive. Apologized to customer for USPS delay, told him I will be filing USPS claim and sending him a refund. I filed USPS claim. Customer meanwhile contacted Amazon Customer Support about refund, and they popped the A to Z.,I contacted customer (who was very nice and understanding this whole time, btw), and he had never heard of an “A to Z” and did not realize this happened and does not want ill to come of my account over this. I don’t even know if this package is ultimately lost or will be eventually delivered (I still have 3 of my own packages bought from nice sellers on the Other Site early last month that have yet to arrive), but I want him to have the product and, of course, give him the refund for his troubles. He still insists on paying for it. That’s all besides the point, though. I just want this A-to-Z to go away. In my appeal message I explained the Buy Postage purchase date, and how after first scan the tracking hasn’t been updated, and that I have filed a claim with the USPS and would like to issue a refund to the seller myself.,So … now what? Do I click the “refund customer” button on my Manage A-to-Z Claims page before waiting for an appeal response? Is there anything else I can do?

Why is Amazon notifying customers that USPS packages are lost and to ask for a replacement? They need to notify customers of the severity of USPS problems,"Selling on Amazon,Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns","Example of USPS holding backlog in a Long Island “unit”… hope they kept them dry.,It’s a mess. I have received 3 emails just this morning from 3 different customers asking for a refund since the packages are stuck in transit. Amazon is not helping us sellers at all. I’m very frustrated,I have dozens of orders (that I know of) which are still delayed. Nearly everything we shipped between 12/4 and 12/9 sat in Jersey City for weeks. Some were never even scanned. To make matters worse amazon is auto granting and seller funding A-Z claims. These packages were shipped within 24 hrs, and postage was bought through amazon. Appealing the decisions has not been successful. Not a good way to start the year.,Did Amazon refund all of those A-Z customers? Sad part is all of those people will get their packages too. Free items. This is terrible,Amazon did the same thing to me. I had been in constant and consistent contact with the buyer, explaining exactly where her package was at all times and presently it has been sitting at HER local USPS distribution center (42 miles from her home) for nine days. I even sent URL’s of news media reports specifically about  ,  distribution center (Lehigh Valley, PA) and the problems with this postal center. The customer was totally unreasonable. Amazon was completely unreasonable. My account is now being threatened with suspension. The customer will receive the item and it is doubtful it will be returned to me (because she has been so nasty and unreasonable) and I am out nearly $75.00. I am tired of hearing that in this Covid-19 pandemic “We are all in this together.” Amazon, PLEASE try and be nice. Amazon, PLEASE support your sellers. Amazon, PLEASE stop rewarding dishonest and unreasonable “customers”. PLEASE.,Agreed.  No support and total silence is one thing, deliberately misleading the customer and backstabbing their own hardworking merchants is another thing entirely.  Completely disgusted.  Amazon takes half of our profits and then uses rope to hang us when their is a national crisis.

Why is Amazon notifying customers that USPS packages are lost and to ask for a replacement? They need to notify customers of the severity of USPS problems,"Selling on Amazon,Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns","LAST IN FIRST OUT (LIFO) at this time.,
They are focusing on moving new mail and “extra” employees are moving the trailers sitting since November.,Makes sense, what is late, is already late.,
What is new, can still be on time.,Yes, they are refunding without a to zs. On their products and 3rd party products.,My experience as a buyer on two shipments:,I ordered an item that was ships from and sold by amazon. Ordered early Dec. Promised delivery was in 2 weeks. It arrived as promised timewise but damaged. I chatted and asked for refund because of documented damage, and explained that a replacement will not get to me in time – it was a Christmas present. Outsourced chat in India argued and argued for 45 mins that I should accept a replacement and they will put a rush on it and it will defnitely reach me. Then she tricked me and said, okay, can I create a mock replacement and see what delivery time it says if I put a rush on it. Then she says, ahhh but now I have already created a replacement for you. So eventually she said, if the replacement does not reach you in time, I will put in the notes that you can get a refund. Sure enough the replacement was not reaching me. I chatted again. Indian team refused to help, but the chat reset itself while I was waiting for a supervisor and I got a gentleman at the South Africa CS center. And he could see the conversations and the notes and said yes, we would definitely refund this. So he refunded me, and then said when the item arrives, you are welcome to keep it, donate it or dispose of it as you see fit.,Second order was a large order of 20-something items, all FBA, different sellers. Ordered in early December (Dec 2 I want to say). I had chosen all to be delivered to a Whole Foods locker because that was showing fastest delivery. Amazon sent the order out in parts – each box or envelope had one or two items. Even simple things like a set of needles came in it’s own poly bag. Comically, I stood at the bank of lockers and kept tapping the screen and doors kept flying open all around me. But two items from the order, shipped together in one box, did not arrive in either of my 3 trips to Whole Foods to collect the items. They were showing a delivery of the Saturday before Christmas, then became Monday, then Tuesday, then Wednesday. On Christmas Eve morning, I checked on the app again and it said “Your items are lost” and it gave me a button to get a refund. The button would not approve of an auto refund, but I got an email, directing me to do a chat or a call. I really wanted the items, so I called UPS and spoke with a supervisor to get them to locate the item, which Amazon had sent out next day air more than a week earlier. UPS said the item was lost and that I should file for a refund with Amazon. So after being told that by both the shipper (Amazon) and the carrier (UPS), and given that they were Christmas themed items, meant to be used for Christmas, I got on chat and asked for a refund. Chat looked it up and refunded me, and sent me an email saying if the item does arrive, I am free to keep/dispose/donate. The sellers are out of their items, but what was I to do, if being told lost by the carrier also?,I never filed an A to Z on those missing items. I just followed what Amazon told me to do on the app and in the email – even though I am a seller. But as a buyer, you are being told very specific things, very forcefully and definitively. And as a customer, if I don’t have my item, and I am being told I am likely never going to receive it, and it is a very specific holiday item, would I just call it a day and ask for a refund, or would I keep waiting and waiting in what seems like vain hope?,Those “lost” UPS items now show tracking in my city. But it is unclear to me whether UPS will ever deliver them. Amazon also told me in their email that they cannot create a replacement order for me. So then that means it’s just sunk money – no product, no replacement. All you can do is ask for your money back.,Can’t blame the customers here. Can 100% blame the carriers here and Amazon also who are just shoveling the losses onto small businesses and walking off with a shrug.,You do not, and cannot file an A to Z claim for an Amazon, FBA or SFP order. (pretty sure about the last one) as Amazon can make all customer service decisions for those 3 methods of shipping.,
For FBA, sellers will request reimbursement from Amazon after the 45 day window has passed. We will see what Amazon does about FBA issues for all this when the time arrives.,That makes sense and I didn’t think that through, but it makes perfect sense.,I guess I should have been more clear about my main point which was that Amazon had no compunction at all about issuing a refund for items sold by 3rd party sellers, but when it came to something sold by them, they did hesitate and gave quite a bit of pushback and delayed it (by Amazon standards) before issuing that refund. They also did not offer an option for a replacement on the 3rd party seller orders. Those sellers (for my orders) are all in China, so what appeals they will manage and what they will get back remains to be seen.,However our new stuff is still sitting!,You know you are right the post office should already have a well prepared game plan. This has been going on for years why can they not get it together.,It’s probably one of those “mine is an exception” things.,I had one package where USPS scanned receipt of package on 5th Dec.  Then literally zero scans until 23rd Dec, but it’s now moving.  That was an unusual delay, but demonstrates the backlogs they’ve had.,exactly.,
If Amazon shipping was used, they should follow their own policy.  They are not doing that.,Why wait?,What are you guys seeing with respect to your performance metrics? We’re clearly taking a hit on ODR, AtoZ, and OnTime Delivery. Has anyone had any success with having Amazon reenabling BuyBox Eligibility? I have called and twice pleaded our case, but got nowhere.,Because, if you had quoted the entire statement:,What we ask for is Amazon be honest to buyers. This just shows how careless Amazon is.,But why?  In other words, why not file now?  I’m filing on day 15 from the first scan for each one.,I will repeat a second time:,If you want to double-dip, that is your prerogative, but waiting to see the outcome of a refund , delivery, is the honest thing to do, since you have a full 60 days to file the claim.,The whole honest thing would be more appealing if Amazon was promoting it.,If the PO can’t deliver in a reasonable amount of time they should be offering credit or a partial refund of the shipping fees paid – 30 days for first class is not acceptable.,Amazon should not be refunding buyers with our money because the PO can’t provide the service they are advertising.,Since neither company seems to be interested in doing the right or honest thing, I feel no guilt in a double-dip, should the opportunity present its self.,The problem here is that USPS is advising people that the package was never given to them. I just got that response from USPS for dozens of packages we gave them that have no tracking showing. They are not even looking to see who wrote to them. Supervisors from across the country emailed me to say, we are so sorry you have been waiting for this package, it looks like the shipper never gave this package to USPS and because USPS never received it, we have not been able to deliver it.,I wrote back to all of them saying, ahem, we are the shippers. And we most certainly did give you the package. I shall wait to see what new nonsense comes around tomorrow.,But really, what a crock of manipulative, dishonest, dishonorable, incompetent garbage that is.  And I am trying very hard to be polite here.,USPS never scanned in the packages, which is why they are showing no tracking. And they are sitting unscanned at USPS sort facilities nationwide. Bins and bins of them. Trailers full. Warehouses full. USPS does not even know where the packages are, because when packages got overloaded at one sort hub, they redirected entire trailers to some other hub thousands of miles away, with no initial tracking saying the packages are going there. Not even the trailer manifest was scanned. So until that new sort hub begins scanning packages, they do not even know they have it.,We have packages sitting in sort facilities as far away as Georgia. Packages that were to be delivered within a 2 hour drive of us – which, in theory, would have counted as 1 day priority mail – have now been sent away to places that are multiple day trips with air travel and truck travel.  Looking online, someone posted their package from Boston to Portland Maine (a 1.5 hour drive) was directed to Kansas, then Oklahoma, where it has made multiple trips back and forth between sort facilities. So while sort facilities play volleyball with our packages, USPS conveniently sends messages saying they were not even given the package.,And who is Amazon to believe in this? And who is the customer to believe?,USPS is disowning its own scan sheet scans, its post office acceptance scans, its trailer scans. They are just saying those are automatic scans, or bulk scans and so that means the shipper is lying and didn’t give us anything. It’s flabbergasting.,So now, this is apparently the new turn from USPS.,First it was, oh we are so so so sorry, we are trying and we promise we will get it done,
Second was, hey stop complaining and just have patience, we have a lot to do,
Third, as lost package claims started coming in, and overtime got killed, they are just looking and saying you know what, to hell with all these packages, we didn’t even get them, so go pound sand. Can’t scan or deliver packages you supposedly did not get, and thus no missing or late claims to be granted either. They just don’t have them, you see?,Corruption tends to trickle down from the top, as it gets normalized, across agencies and society. So here USPS is now, trying to wallpaper over the whole deliberately planted delays and the deliberate staff shortages, and the deliberate removal of machines, and the deliberate reduction of delivery route times and the deliberate cancelation of overtime… on and on and on. It’s become a big mess with consequences that no decision maker wants to own and a bill that neither the government agency nor Amazon wants to foot. So… just blame the sellers. It’s all those wily, lying, cheating mom-and-pop/family owned/veteran owned small businesses across the country who claimed to have shipped out millions of packages but never did, you know.,wow I am so sorry. I stopped using scan forms before the election when I realized there was a big difference in how the tracking shows. It says “package acceptance pending” until the next scan. So if it sits for weeks, that makes it look pending! When its actually received. I have my mail carrier scan each and every package as picked up. I recommend everyone do this! dont use the stupid forms, it may take more time, but when they scan it it says"" picked up"" in your town with the exact time, Then it shows departed your post office. They cannot deny they have that package and you have proof you gave it to them immediately. Those of you who just take them in and leave them…super risky! Over the summer, I did that and they never scanned them at origin post office in Maryland. It wasnt a problem then bc they did get a scan later that night, but we all know that is not happening right now. Its there job to scan each one, so I don’t feel bad and if there is a mail count…my carrier makes more money if she counts every piece and the volume is higher then it was for her so you know what you’re scanning them all the time then!,That’s the issue. Citing Amazon policy doesn’t help the 1 star reviews customers will leave which lowers your overall feedback rating. Buyers have no idea that some USPS hubs are more several affected than others. And do they not watch the news or see what’s going on with USPS struggling delivering packages all over??,this is the first time I’ve responded to anything in this forum in years. I just want to agree with every comment about how alarming it is for amazon to be telling our customers their order is lost. How outrageous. Do they want to force us all to go out of business? Just disgusting. We all need to remember this when amazon conducts one of their countless seller polls. I’ve been selling on amazon for 20 years and have never seen them do something so despicable."
Why is Amazon notifying customers that USPS packages are lost and to ask for a replacement? They need to notify customers of the severity of USPS problems,"Selling on Amazon,Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns","Just got two more messages today about delayed packages. Both of them said Amazon sent them an email telling them their package is lost. This is ridiculous!,I put mine on vacation mode a week and a half ago.  After seeing the fallout everyone else has experienced, I plan to leave it on vacation mode.  Amazon is not worthy of my efforts and it is self defeating to enable AMZ when there are viable and, by comparison, benevolent options.   They must be held legally and financially liable.  This is theft on an industrial scale and it’s sabotage.,So what I have been doing is: if I receive an email from a buyer asking me about their lost/delayed package, I point them to the message put out by the USPS in red block on their website. I apologize and sympathize with them. I also point them to the tracking page on the USPS to let them know the best page to track their package - Amazon’s tracking does not provide all the details, such as where it has been delivered to (their mailbox, their front porch or to an individual).,Then, I tell them that if the package does not arrive by Christmas eve or if they do not wish to keep the order because it has arrived too late, to refuse the unopened package and hand it to their mail carrier or post office, so it could be sent back to me free of charge to them. I will refund as soon as I receive the package back.,I am giving my customers a choice. I am not going to refund left and right. I am actually glad that my sales have been slower this holiday season (but I was super busy from March till June when Covid first hit and I have made most of my sales this year during that time), so I don’t have to keep dealing with this delay issue. My shipping time metrics is now sitting at an all-time low though.,If I receive an email from one of these buyers, I would mention that the package has not been lost. It has been delayed and then point to the buyer the tracking info of THEIR package on USPS’ website (give them the link to their tracking page).,I will also mention the message put out by the USPS on their website, regarding the delay, so these customers can start planning the next course of action - buy another present locally or just tell the gift recipient their present would arrive after X’mas.,I may also mention that Amazon’s computer system is automatically sending out those generic “lost package” email because their system is programmed to send out those emails when a package has not arrived by the last date of the delivery window. However, the package is not lost; rather, it has been delayed.,Complaining here won’t help. Write to you Congressman. In Europe, sellers are treated much better because they complained to their government representatives and they did something about it. They are easy to find and easy to reach.,Normally I would tell them this, too, but considering how slowly everything is moving now, I can only imagine how long it would take to get a return to sender shipment back.  A buyer will be even more unhappy if they have to wait another month for their refund after refusing delivery.  Unless you plan to refund when seeing the refused delivery/return to sender tracking update.,Please note, you have , to file a claim for Priority Insured Mail. ,
Wait to see if the parcel is delivered , if Amazon funded you first.,USPS Claims reference:,I have the same problem. Then, when one of those packages from the scan form finally gets a scan at a distribution center 15 days after I shipped it, it shows “accepted at (my local) Post Office” 15 days later too! And this is on the USPS website! NOT RIGHT! Especially since my PO requires the scan forms - I don’t have the option of getting every package individually scanned.,Thank you, yes, that is pretty much what I have been telling everyone.,
It’s bad enough that Amazon doesn’t have our backs regarding this USPS mess, but sending out emails to customers that their package is lost is adding insult to injury (UNDERSTATEMENT!),I am pretty sure what is happening is that at certain distribution centers they have entire trailers of mail that are just sitting, waiting to be processed. This much is well documented by employees. They are parked somewhere and all of the new trailers coming in keeps anyone from ever getting to them… in other words, it is not ‘first in, first out’; it is more like ‘first in, last out’.,The way to deal with this is to file a claim for something that is missing. This forces management at that location to search for your package, which shows it never left their location. Presto! They go and pull all of the old trailers that they have not been getting to, and your package begins to move again.,While they are processing all of these old trailers, more recent trailers coming in are set aside; parked in their place. Now these newer trailers are the ones that will sit and not get processed, and so the cycle repeats…,I may just refund after I see the “return to sender” message on the tracking page. Most of my customers seem quite patient, though a few would follow the tracking daily and email me as soon as they see it scanned “delivered”., It’s irresponsible and fraudulent.,If the post office was aware (as we all are) WHY did they give mail dates for 1st class, Priority, and Priority Express that are completely unrealistic?,USPS website shows - Priority Mail dropped off by December 19th would arrive by Christmas.,Well - I’m waiting on numerous packages from early December through December 14th to still be delivered. Tracking shows no movement at all.,Amazon needs to dump the post office as an option for mailing through their shipping services.  I’ve had better luck with UPS ground and 2-day.,It appears that most the more recent shipments (12/14-12/21) are moving as normal. It is those 12/12 and prior that are sitting, not getting scanned, etc.,I agree. Amazon must STOP telling customer their packages are lost. Customers are requesting replacements or refunds. I spoke to the USPS postmaster today and was informed that as of December 10th UPS and Fed-X stopped picking up at drop sites such as Kohls and other locations because of the large quantity of Amazon packages. USPS must service these customers now which brought on a massive amount of additional packages slowing down the movement of regular packages. The postmaster insisted that within the next 2 weeks things should be better and back to a “some what” normal delivery time. My concern is if we keep getting requests from customers for refunds and then these same customers eventually get their package we as the seller will be in a financial problem!!! Amazon must step up and send out notices to ALL customers that their packages are on the way.,Etsy (which unfortunately is not as successful for me as an Amazon seller) even has a banner emblazoned on their screen that packages will be late. I have heard from Ebay sellers that the selling platform as notified buyers of the slow down.,
Not Amazon! They are telling people to ask for a refund or a replacement. Like, WHY?!,I am a handmade seller and I have busted by butt making sure everything is out same or next day. Cleveland, OH literally has semi-trucks sitting outside the main hub.,
I get the notification on my phone and I am annoyed - to the point where I am about to uninstall it and just deal with these constant requests on my computer.,Im so over it.,Hopefully the worst of the backlog is behind USPS and they can finally start picking away at the huge mountain of packages piled up all over the country.,A bunch of my First Class shipped and scanned as accepted on the 14th, 15th and 16th have finally started showing movement/new tracking scans ( yay … ) .  Completely unacceptable and beyond my control - but still very much my problem to deal with. Customers don’t like being told their order is most likely sitting in a USPS trailer waiting at a backlogged distribution center for over a week or 2.,Can’t wait for this year to be over …and then only 30 more days of the  Extended Holiday Return period,As of today, 12/28 they are now clearing trailers from 11./28.,
ONE.  MONTH.  LATER.,Just in time for Christmas 2021!,I don’t think they’re using a FIFO method.  It’s probably more FILO since as the backlog built it probably piled infront of packages arriving earlier."
Why is Amazon notifying customers that USPS packages are lost and to ask for a replacement? They need to notify customers of the severity of USPS problems,"Selling on Amazon,Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns","Yes, please watch seller university, and read the terms of the functions of the process’ you are using on Amazon. It can save you a lot of money in both claims and bad decisions.,
"" ,  If you purchase Amazon’s Buy Shipping and ship on time, you are protected against claims where a customer reports problems with delivery. Amazon will cover the cost of these claims and they will not affect your Order Defect Rate."",
,again, amazon is NOT honoring this policy.,That does not mean you simply avoid the whole process and start giving away your money. At least try and save some money and have integrity for your business, actions, products and employees, by requiring the customer go through the process.,
For all you know the buyer has 24 A to Z claims that day and is a known fraud account, but you choose to give them money. It works for fake monks in every city and for magnet bracelets in between news cycles.,And a totally separate issue from notifying customer of their legal rights in compliance with Federal Law.,The notification on behalf of Sellers by Amazon is a good thing. Amazon not honoring their contractual obligations and/or false and misleading advertisement of goods and services to Sellers is a separate unconnected (although it does not feel that way, to Sellers who are losing money) issue.,While I would prefer not to rollover I’ve now been hit with two ODRs after failed appeals. Amazon is putting us in a tough spot, give away our stuff for free or face losing our accounts due to high ODR,While I understand the difficulty, I have yet to read about a seller in your position getting a suspension notification for their ODR due to claims in this period. The one or two that I have read stem back to November, and have other serious issues with their account. I want you to make your own informed business decision, but I also do not want yours and other sellers actions to indicate to the customer or Amazon that sellers will take it in the shorts, which translates to my business.,
It is a tough spot for sure, but I imagine Amazon would have a hard time suspending a wide chunk of sellers this time of year, for expecting Amazon to honor its buy shipping agreements. I do not see rolling over as an example that will result in a seller win. You will pay now financially and have demonstrated that you will be the one to pay it in the future.,Yes you do.  If you use Amazon postage and ship on time, if the buyer files an A to Z or claims non delivery you “should” be covered.,
Lately they are not honoring that, the post office is not scanning so they are using the excuse that it was a late shipment.  We ship every day.  We’re picked up by USPS trailers and taken to distribution centers.  The distribution centers are either not scanning when they arrive, or waiting a week before scanning and moving the packages forward.  I’m outside of Philadelphia so our packages go there, we are told there are so many tractor trailers FULL OF PACAKGES that the parking lot is full and they stretch 3 blocks down the street.  These packages were picked up from us on the 6th, 8th and 10th.  The amount of money we will lose is insane.,I just got off the phone with my mail carrier who does a lot of talking to the Postmaster of my PO on my behalf and he was told that the distribution centers are currently focused on clearing their backlogs and delivering parcels that are already in the system and are not processing new shipments.  I was flat-out told not to send anything via USPS for the rest of the holiday season (which I already figured out on my own, but to hear it from straight from the PO is concerning).,This is for the Chicago area.,I was told that last week.,
We are using UPS at this time and everything is moving well through the system.,
Really horrifying.,I just got calls from two different postal centers over two of the many tracking claims I have filed in the last few days. I will say they were both very honest about the situation and polite.,The first  one told me I have no doubt your package is sitting in our parking lot waiting to be unloaded. He said they had dozens of trucks they couldn’t unload because the warehouse didn’t have enough bins and because the warehouse is so full the bins they do have can barely move. He also said that some trailers have been sitting for over a week and right now there is a line over a mile long of new trucks waiting to drop their trailers.  He very bluntly said he couldn’t even guess how many weeks it will take to get caught up. He said the package load this year was up 50% and to make it worse every time an employee gets sick they and anyone who works within 15 feet of them must quarantine for 14 days. Also he said UPS and Fedex are dropping their packages and that is just making the system even worse.,I asked if packages sent by Amazon got priority an he said yes because they have their own loading area to drop packages and they have an agreement to deliver or ship them on by the next day.,The second agent said the package had finally moved and was in the customers home town. She said don’t get excited because even though it’s a small town, they have a lot to deliver and it may still not get delivered by Christmas.,Don’t like what I’m hearing but it is refreshing to get an honest assessment ,something we don’t get from Amazon.,This is one of many reasons Trump was making a big deal about Amazon’s contract with USPS and USPS operations in general.  Terrible short-sighted contracts that are going to undoubtedly erode trust in the USPS and they are going to lose far more future business than they could have ever earned from dirt cheap rates they provide Amazon.  Anyone who worked on this contract should be out of a job and those who continued to defend it publicly should be forced into 16 hour work days at the USPS distribution centers until the backlogs are all cleared.,We’ve been Business Sellers since 2012. WE HAVE NEVER SEEN IT THIS BAD. AtoZ claims awarded daily, irate customers, no support from the AMAZON team, and we are losing money.  Considering vacation mode for the rest of the year. Amazon margins are already narrow, it’s not worth it at this point.,so has dismantling of USPS sorting machines that began in June…,deleted,We agree, and to be honest Amazon usually does back up the seller when Amazon shipping is used.  Since USPS is not scanning properly the system is now putting us in the position where we must refund regardless of policy.  I do not believe that’s Amazon’s intention but just what’s happening now.,
We ship quickly every single day and because we are picked up by the tractor trailers that are more than likely sitting in those distribution centers, there are late scans or none at all.  So I am guessing this “voids” amazon’s buy shipping protection, although I’m not sure why since USPS has been transparent about the fact that they aren’t scanning.,
We all got caught short here, I do not believe Amazon expected this mess either.,
My faith tho is in Amazon and yes we have to reimburse these buyers but this may bring forth a policy change to support us in the (rare) event this happens again.,
Moving forward use UPS.  They do scan immediately and from what we are seeing they are delivering very timely.,
So glad for this forum and all the positive support of so many.,
We will get through this mess some how!,I agree…I have two feedbacks struck through , yes thats great, but also have two claims already and god knows how many people messaging that I am trying to hold over from doing so. Im pleading with them to just refuse the package or return it and not open claims, etc. But how many really care and no one is helping us at all. I have so many here an etsy that its scary. I mean Im surprised I can sleep at night scary. An entire months worth of orders, half maybe delivered if that. Its so bad. Ive been in business 17 years and I am terrified right now. And I feel like I have no options I cant use UPS, my things are light and that starts at like $8. My items only cost around $10 to $15. I gave the post office 60k this year and they may have ruined my business. And amazon is not helping us…at least back when covid started, they seemed to care, now there is no help.,do you mean no scans like after the initial acceptance scan? like the in transit arrive late? Or you dont even have an acceptance scan showing? I never have a problem w acceptance scan having my carrier scan each one individually.,Anyone else going to be filing claims?,Doing business in this environment is a lot like home building. If you want to retire from Amazon selling with a $1,000,000 make sure you start with $2,000,000!,I am in Indiana, my shipments are processed at Indianapolis. ALL of my Priority Mail packages from 12/5 are still showing “package pending acceptance”. There are 70+ of them so you can imagine how much fun it is dealing with (justifiably) upset customers who interpret this to mean they are still sitting here, not picked up. This has been a nightmare.,If USPS scans a manifest for the whole shipment when they do, indeed, pick it up and take it away, why in the he** do they get to say “package pending acceptance” in tracking and thus act like they don’t even have it yet?"

Amazon KNOWS all 3 carriers are delayed.  It’s a fact.  Rather than asking for the customers’ patience they are basically saying “go get em, get your money back!”.  Maybe it’s me but I find that just a horrible way to build and keep trust on the site.,We are picked up by a USPS tractor trailer.  They don’t scan anything.  Usually the first scan we will see is acceptance at one or another distribution center and that may not happen for a day or two - or three at this time of year.  Now all of a sudden, customers are messaging accusing us of not shipping on time.  Because they don’t see that initial scan.  We stopped using scan forms because our carrier picked up a days packages, and scanned the form as DELIVERED.  Within hours, we had hundreds of buyers requesting refunds, A to Z’s being opened left and right.  We did not use amazon shipping at that time.  It was a mess.,We are absolutely no control over USPS.  And whether they admit that or not Amazon knows it.  By antagonizing a buyer with those messages I don’t think they’re promoting good will to sellers or to the site as a whole.,I’m on vacation now and will stay that way for a few more days until people look at the date and UNDERSTAND they won’t get this item before Christmas.,Our USPS office said none of their express packages are and will be on time.,

I am struggling with wording, and this year I’ve only had half the sales I should. I cannot afford to refund or give all these orders away.,Sure.  You should reword, if you were/are not taking the actions we took for orders.  I also attached the Seller Support case that I mention in the template. Not really good for anyone else to use, as the support agent seemed to actually look at my account, but a good idea of what you should try to get SS to do and say.  I have not refunded a single one of these orders as of yet (a good 30 requests by now).  Only had maybe 2 reply back with requests to still refund NOW, but they have gone silent since then.  Just trying to get people to understand the reasoning for the delays and that they are more than welcome to return for another month and a half if it is late.,""Hello [CUSTOMER NAME],,I am sorry that the order has not arrived yet.  Please allow some more time for arrival.,I want to assure you, that your order is not lost.  It is stuck at a sorting facility due to reduction in staffing at some of these facilities due to covid.  The carriers are moving packages as quickly as they possibly can.  These issues are nationwide and currently effecting about 10% of packages.,If the order is received too late, please remember that any purchase made on Amazon between October 1st and December 31st can be returned up to January 31st.  Amazon is telling buyers to open return requests now for orders that may arrive to late due to covid and shipping them back once they arrive (see attachment).,Between the holiday season and the pandemic, some packages are getting delayed beyond our control.  We have been doing everything we can to get orders to customers as soon as possible.  This includes shipping on or ahead of schedule and setting our delivery windows as far out as Amazon’s system will allow to help create reasonable expectations for this unprecedented holiday season.,We are just as frustrated as you are with these delays.  Please bear with us this holiday season.,Thank You for Your Patience,
Stay Safe and Happy Holidays,[NAME],Been here since 2004.,
This is the worst I have ever seen.,And with all that being said, and Amazon being aware of all of this, they continue to grant A to Z claims seeing packges enroute, some very close to delivery.,The losses many sellers will experience during this time will be staggering.  We all know these items are going to delivery, the customer is going to call Amazon customer service who will then generously tell the buyer to “just keep the item.”,USPS has told me to keep a log and report these individuals.  I’m in no way that “kind of person” but I think this may be the time to start altering my thinking.  If USPS wants to take action against them, that may not be a bad thing…after all it’s their system that caused the delay. USPS says keeping an item you did not pay for is theft, regardless of what Amazon tells them.   OUr delivery supervisor says they can ask Amazon for a lawyer to represent them.  I laughed.  Almost.,Who at USPS told you to keep a log of these people?  Do you have contact information?  I will keep track mine as well in case something can be done.,man I’m glad I scaled back our Amazon sales this year. It’s bad enough on our own website and eBay. Of course Amazon will keep “their” customer happy by giving them our money.,Both our business representative and local delivery supervisor.  There’s a larger seller at the end of our center here that turns Amazon buyers in every week.  He says USPS sends them a letter or in some instances, goes to the door with the Amazon or ebay order showing the item was refunded, telling them accepting merchandise that is not paid for, or claiming non delivery is against USPS policy.  I am not sure what is done to these buyers but I can tell you what if a postal inspector came to my door I’d be a bit concerned.,Our local office is wonderful and my business representative is fantastic.  I think USPS is tired of being thrown under the bus by the ecommerce venues, knowing that many people are being dishonest by claiming non receipt when in fact the delivery did happen.  eBay and Amazon make it very easy.  And of course the process happens over and over again.  If these people can be identified possibly there’s a legal way to stop them. (and a local postmaster, seeing the same address over and over will know this wasn’t just an honest misdelivery) .,
This entire thing is exhausting,
2 A to Z’s paid today, both items will deliver today or tomorrow.  entire process is exhausting,It is good the hear, that at-least someone at the USPS is doing something about it.  Not only in this instance where stuff will arrive late for many people after refunds are given out, but in instances where people do lie, or the packages are stolen off the customers property after delivery (you cannot go back to Walmart and ask for a refund because someone stole your yard ornament).,Can you clarify what you mean by that? If we buy our postage through Amazon, do we have some extra level of protection against having to give refunds for lost/delayed packages?"
Why is Amazon notifying customers that USPS packages are lost and to ask for a replacement? They need to notify customers of the severity of USPS problems,"Selling on Amazon,Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns","If anything, this has been a good wake-up call for us that Amazon’s days as a safe place to sell are over. The issues with the mailing system are what they are, I get it - not much to do there. More concerning to me is Amazon’s radio silence through this whole thing, and the only ‘help’ they’ve offered is automatic emails to customers falsely informing them their packages are lost.  We’ve been iffy about continuing our Amazon selling experience for a while, what with the increasing fees and decreasing service they pay for, but this Christmas season has cemented it: we’re done with Amazon. We’ll be spending all of 2021 replacing Amazon as an income channel.,We’ve also learned another valuable lesson in all this: don’t ever trust the USPS. Ever. We use scan sheets, but they apparently don’t do what the supervisor at our local PO claimed they did, which was show everything as accepted. We’re now getting multiple messages a day from people asking where their stuff is, and I go to look only to find that initial scans are showing up a WEEK after the USPS scanned my scan sheet. If, somehow, we make it through this selling season without Amazon suspending half it’s third party sellers for late deliveries they had no control over, I intend to go through and file claims on every single package they screwed our business on.  Happy 2020 everyone!,I think every seller that is FBM will be experiencing pains all around. We’ve been receiving messages as well and informing the customer of the status of the package. Somehow, we seem to be receiving emails again saying we never responded to their messages. So not only do we have a failing carrier issue, but a broken messaging channel as well. Amazon, you need to overhaul the buyer-seller messaging system ASAP… unacceptable!!,To all sellers who use scan sheets - stop using them, they DO NOT work. We found out the hard way last holiday season. We take every package to our local post office and make them scan every one while we stand there and watch, then verify the number before we leave. It’s not a perfect system because humans are still involved, but it mitigates most issues that everyone seems to be dealing with in this thread. It is inconvenient to do this everyday, but I will take inconvenience over brain damage any day of the week.,Yes, they see this coming, but with Covid there are more precautions, more people out, as well as everyone is ordering online more than ever due to not wanting to go out in turn flooding the postal services.,Does Amazon refund sellers the shipping cost on shipments that are delayed indefinitely and buyers are refunded through Amazon claims?,No. Why would they? If Amazon covers the refund, you still get all the order proceeds.,I didn’t say it was an Amazon-covered refund scenario. Sometimes (who am I kidding? Many times.) orders are refunded straight out of our pockets by Amazon.,How many A to Z claims did you have? That is pretty impressive speed being customers have to wait 3 days after delivery to file a claim, and the claim itself takes about a week on average.,I never had an A to Z, knock on nothing. But in the past 2 days Customer Service has been refunding a ton of orders shipped out a few weeks ago. Dec 3 was a bad day for my stuff – a batch that day got the first scan and then disappeared into the USPS. It’s too early to do a SAFE-T claim because they haven’t been delivered. I’m just making note of all orders & sometime early next month will do SAFE-Ts for all the delivered stuff that they refunded, and for stuff that USPS has actually lost will do claims through them.,The claims are being granted almost immediately right now.  Also customers have to wait 3 days after delivery OR 3 days after the EDD,Buyers can file a Claim under our A-to-z Guarantee for two basic buyer issues:,Example: You fail to deliver an item within 3 calendar days of either the maximum estimated delivery date [EDD], or the date of delivery confirmed by a valid tracking link, whichever is sooner.,Buyer eligibility criteria for filing a Claim:,we are having a lot of messages a day requesting refund saying package is lost by USPS as well. Amazon needs to issue the same alert as USPS instead of allowing customer to request refund.,what we have been doing is to copy and paste the alert information from USPS to customers. most customers does not respond back, but some will still request refund. we than sent out the message again stating that the packages are not lost and USPS is doing everything they can to get those packages to the customers., I am not dealing with “lost” packages, I am just dealing with delays and why Amazon is not protecting us when buyers are demanding refunds when their package shows it is running late, tracking through the system, etc.  It makes no sense for the same package that they just won a claim on Amazon will protect me in feedback when they complain about shipping delays.  I’ve been using the same post office since the '80s and know them well. As far as putting items in the bin it’s behind a locked door and this is the way they have it set up.  They might have 1-2 people working the counter and a few in the back - they are that short staffed.  Most of the time the items are not scanned until the next hub.,Hi, I thought you couldn’t do a SAFE-T claim if the buyer open and A-to-Z claim?,Dumb question, but when they issue these refunds and you get this mail –,Is that an A-Z claim?,You can see my confusion.,So if I am reading this right, Amazon customer service is refunding customers without them having to file an A to Z? Does that mean there is no criteria for the A to Z and they just refund if you call with an order?,
Time to start ordering random stuff and calling a day later. I wonder if this works for items Amazon is selling? (don’t want to burn another seller),JK,I hear you. If these sort of things continues Amazon will only have scammers for buyers and no independent sellers. Good,let them keep all their scammers and take over all our small businesses. Lets see how long they can survive.,No, they are filing the A-to-Z claim and immediately refunding the buyer from your account and dinging your metrics.  You can appeal but what’s the point if it is still in “transit” - so this time I am waiting for the package to show delivered.  SO frustrating!,Yeah, that’s basically it.,I never had an A-Z ever. I just looked now under Performance and I’m still in the clear, no A-Z. But what’s going on is Customer Service is refunding their customers left and right and up and down with our stuff – we sold a ton of our bestselling product in early December and many orders are stuck in post office neverneverland and CS is just giving all these people refunds.,No, you can’t miss an A-Z claim.  The email looks like this,We have granted an A-to-z Guarantee claim of $xx.xx on order xxx-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx. We have debited the amount from your account and have counted the claim against your Order Defect Rate.,Why is this happening?,
The A-to-z Guarantee protects customers when they purchase items sold and fulfilled by you directly. Our guarantee covers both the timely delivery and the condition of items you sell. If customers are unsatisfied with either and cannot reach a resolution with you, we enable them to file a claim with us. In this case, the customer claimed an issue with delivery and the tracking information you provided was either insufficient or the order was not actually received by the customer.,So this is where a safe T claim would come in then? I have never had to use one cause A to Z makes that process moot in our cases.,You said above that you were SFP.  Last I checked, Amazon provides customer service - including issuing refunds - for SFP sellers.  No A-Z required.  It’s just part of the service that you are paying for."
Why is Amazon notifying customers that USPS packages are lost and to ask for a replacement? They need to notify customers of the severity of USPS problems,"Selling on Amazon,Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns","Sorry to hear that. It would be nice to at least have the chance to refund an upset customer BEFORE they file an A-to-Z.,Our postal supervisor said not to bother with intercepts.,
We arrived this morning to 29 messages about late deliveries.,
Some things are scanning others are not.,
I just keep shaking my head as to how most of us are going to be able,
to get out from under this.  Thousands in losses, damage to accounts.,
Amazon really needs to step up here.,Their ongoing silence throughout this has me thinking that isn’t going to happen. ,You must be new here. There is no bigger group of idiots than Amazon, and hoping for any help from them is the most futile thing you can do.,Make sure to appeal.,
I believe Amazon policy is they have to notify you of a claim, and,
you are supposed to be covered if you use Amazon Buy Shipping Service and the package was scanned within the two day handling period.,I have had two A-Z overturned so far and have two more pending appeal now.  I believe most will lose money, but amazon will erase metrics for December.  Don’t grant refunds, kill customer with kindness but I just ask them to wait.,I sent alleged third-day priority presents to my folks, as is my wont, direct from my home.,They were picked up on Thursday.,As of yesterday afternoon, they were still pending.  Not a good sign I think…,Does Amazon read these posts? How do we bump? They did so well back in March and things went mostly smooth then. Now that ishhits the fan they have ghosted us.,That’s the way it’s supposed to work, but that’s not how it’s working.  Amazon is upholding appeals and dinging our accounts regardless of their published policy.,It’s going from bad to worse. Now we’re seeing packages that haven’t moved from pre-shipment for over two weeks. To the customer it just looks like we never shipped the package at all.,We had two packages stuck for weeks with no tracking at all (several others were stuck with no tracking for 4-7 days). We filed cases on both of them with USPS, using the phone line, last Friday evening just as they were closing. On Monday afternoon, we spoke with a supervisor at the local carrier annex, where the carrier who picked up the packages would have taken the boxes. She said the boxes were not at the annex because they do a full sweep every morning and every evening.,After we talked for a bit, she offered to send an email to a contact at the LARGE processing facility (that sorts and distributes mail for a multi state region and is one of the largest in the United States). It’s Wednesday night. One package has already moved along, and is on its way now after being stuck since the end of November. It should be delivered this week.,The other one still does not show tracking, but today I received an email from a supervisor at Consumer Affairs for the region where the package is going. He said the package is likely in a truck at one of the most overloaded airport facilities in that area. He said that facility has been working through the packages, and he has put this tracking number on his personal list to follow up on constantly for additional movement. Tomorrow, I will make a call again, to try to find someone at that airpot facility who can be messaged, in order get more movement.,So, the thing is, you can get stuck packages moving. But you have to start by filing cases and following up on it, so behind the scenes people start looking for your package and move it along. WIthout that, it is just sitting somewhere waiting for its turn at the scanning machine.,I see a lot of sellers here writing in anger and frustration and helplessness. I get all those feelings. But business leaves no room for feelings. So take heart,  that tt is definitely not “going from bad to worse”. And then take action – file a case, track and submit update requests diligently every 12 hours, follow up on your case, talk to supervisors, ask them to make calls/send emails to find your package. And inform your customers of all the efforts you are taking on their behalf, urging them to wait a few more days.,USPS workers are working long hours to get packages to people. Senior clerks at my post office have been working from 5:30 am to 11:30 pm the last couple of weeks working at the post office first and the carrier annex to get things moving. One of them told me yesterday she has been so busy she has been forgetting to even get a drink of water or a meal for 8 hours at a stretch and then realizing it when she gets a really bad headache. These are our friends and neighbors, working to help us all. We can help their effort along – instead of getting mad, point out the package that is stuck, file a case, and help start a search chain by starting at the first facility where your package would have gone and enlisting their help in trying to figure out where it is stuck. They are not mailicious people. They have been working very hard all year against daunting odds.,Instead of spending time here on the forum venting your frustrations and fears about stuck packages, use that time to make a list of all those packages and then get on the phone with USPS. File a case. And then set aside phone time on the next few days to talk to individuals in local offices so you can follow up on the cases. Your job is this – get the packages to customers before Christmas. Getting angry here and yelling at Amazon is not going to get that done. Calling USPS and filing cases and tracking updates and following up on them is the only concrete thing you can do right now. I humbly suggest that is the path to follow.,Same. Hundreds and hundreds of dollars are being refunded by Customer Service with thrusted fists as if it were OPM. Other People’s Money. Oh, wait, it ,.,Just think of the customer’s delight: free merchandise. “Gee, thanks Amazon for making 2020 a little bit better for me! I think I’ll order , one!”,Such an enormous headache to have to deal with – and I’ve been closed since the weekend. Now I wish I would have shut it down sooner. I’m not reopening any time soon – my Amazon model for money in recent years involved SFP, which dies forever in about 40 days, so I need to make a new plan anyway. I am actually thinking of just staying on vacation – have to figure out about canceling the Professional (lol) plan and what repercussions if any that would have should I ever come back to this rat dance.,This past week I have had 3 A-to-Z claims immediately granted in the buyer’s favor and my account dinged and funds removed.  All shipping was purchased from Amazon shipping.  My post office is very short-staffed and we have to place our packages in a bin (during this time-frame I had over 100 a day) most are not scanned but sent to the next hub where they just sit before moving onto another hub and finally scanned.  Each claim granted, I kept in contact with the customer, contacted USPS, and filed a “missing package” claim, packages were tracking only to stall for a few days before being scanned again sometimes at the same location.  Each time the package was delivered a few days after they won the A-to-Z claim.  Why is Amazon penalizing us for the delays when they are striking out feedback for shipping delays stating , “The fulfillment issues associated with this order were not due to the seller” on the very packages I was just penalized for!  So frustrating!,Did you try to appeal and copy paste their policy in the response?,Yes, I did and they still denied my claim.  The one I just received a few hours ago I will wait and appeal after the package is delivered.   USPS shows it should arrive Saturday.,I just received this response on another appeal that I filed the same day after Amazon granted the buyer the A-to-Z claim.  The package was still in transit and still tracking with the last scan on the 15th the day the buyer filed.,
""Hello,,Thank you for taking the time to provide us with additional information regarding the claim on order 1. Upon further review, we have decided to uphold our original decision.,Why was my appeal denied?,
We have reviewed all available information and determined you have not provided sufficient evidence to prove delivery.,For more information about the A-to-z Guarantee policy, assistance in navigating the A-to-z Guarantee Claims page, or how to avoid claims in the future, please refer to our help pages: ,Thank you.,
-Amazon"",We have had 3 of 4 a-z overturned so far.   Not sure about why the one was not, but it was a less expensive item.   The larger ticket items have been overturned and refunded by Amazon.  Here is the email I send when appealing.,
I am open to suggestions for any changes, but figured I would share what has worked so far.  I am also going to add a previous order id and a-z claim number to a successful appeal to hope ward off any future denials.,We would like to appeal the decision of the A-Z claim 1. We were never notified of a claim issued against us. 2. we used amazon buy shipping option with the address provided by the customer. 3. the product is in the USPS system and apparently stuck at a transit center. 4 we have no control once the product is in the system and scanned by USPS 5. we answered all emails in a timely fashion with options for customer. 6. again, we were never notified of a-z claim buy customer.,This should not count our metrics since the claim was filed against amazon policy for improper notification of filing and notification from the customer.,USPS and UPS are behind in shipping and we have had multiple a-z claims overturned due to the points mentioned above.  Please see the following for reference:XXXXXXXX,to just_for_fun_s…I am over here by palmerton area. So everything goes to the LV sort facility but it was often then going to Harrisburg and even Lancaster! They have things of mine not anywhere but picked up in palmerton and departed since Dec 2. They have a bad habit of dealing with new stuff sometimes and burying old things. Its really really bad and now all this snow makes it worse.,Pockets54…I stopped using scan forms when all of this started back around the election. I feel like our only protection that they have our items is to watch them scan everything. My mail carrier stops and is wonderful, she scans anywhere between 50-100 plus packages a day for me and doesn’t complain. With things sitting for days and weeks I would never take the chance of leaving them in a bin. If they missed one it looks like you did not ship it. And scan forms if you ever noticed say “package acceptance pending” even when they have it. When they physically scan it it says ""picked up in "" your town. Then departed your town…not that it matters much when a customer opens a claim, but I have found that at least this way the customer knows I definitely gave them their package.,DONT USE SCAN FORMS! I was trying to be nice and use scan forms until I realized it always says package acceptance pending. if you can get a carrier scan by your mail carrier, that is uploaded at the exact time of the scan and says “picked up”. Big difference in how it displays in tracking. I dont care if it takes 20 minutes to scan my packages, I have to do what I have to do to protect myself with this mess, there was no way I wanted packages to say “package acceptance pending” for weeks. Thats what it looks like when you use a scan form.   Until it gets to the next location, which is now sometimes weeks or more.,this is true.  We stopped using them about a year and a half ago when our carrier scanned 250 packages DELIVERED upon pick up.,
Within hours we had many a to z’s against us, and at that time we did not use Amazon shipping.  We lost all of our money.  Carrier thought it was funny.,Moving forward I’m going to make them scan every package, however I want to move away from them totally.,
I have 550 pieces of mail picked up from me on a sunday (they gave me a special pick uup) sitting in a container in Philadelphia.  FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY.  That’s 550 refunds or a to z claims.,I hope everyone that sells on line takes rath against USPS and files claims or whatever action they can.  I’m sorry, if they knew they couldn’t handle the volume, THEN STOP TAKING PACKAGES.  Many sellers will never get out from under this."

We have become lazy Americans.,Nail, meet nuke.,Well, hi neighbor!  I grew up in Livonia.,
I’m saying this while knocking on wood, I still haven’t had a customer message me about a late order.  Kind of unbelievable seeing as it seems to happen even during normal times.

Lord if Amazon is the most trusted company, we’re all in even deeper trouble than i thought.,Hi.  Is there a link to where he did this, the new postmaster? Just curious, if so, does seem like intentional sabotauge.,Here’s something showing how USPS actually backfills some of this information.  This is an image I posted earlier.  This was when tracking finally started to track my package, a week after I actually dropped it off.  Note, there is no SCAN from “Shipment Received” showing:,
,Today, I checked tracking for the same order and magically the SCAN form scan shows up:,
,Not saying it’s nefarious, but it’s just weird how it happens like that.  Somewhere in that system, the scan was hiding.,Just for fun s I could not agree with you more on that last part…the emails that I have received, although I actually appreciate receiving an email far more than when they just skip that part and go right to the A-Z Claim, have been beyond rude. I am like hey I am trying to help here I certainly did not intend for your shipment to be weeks late when I paid for 2-3 business day delivery. It can be very difficult to remain level-headed at times…but really what is frustrating me way more are those A-Z Claims that come with no previous communication whatsoever from the customer, and seeing them automatically granted immediately.,Philadelphia reported there are 3 to 5 tractor trailers FULL OF PACKAGES that have been sitting since December 3rd.

I am not even getting the opportunity to try to save myself here…I feel so helpless., difference whatsoever in transit time.

They need to notify customers of the severity of USPS problems,"Selling on Amazon,Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns","I didn’t know Lake owned Amazon.  Is that Jeff Bezos?,I believe this only applies as long as your order does get delivered within the delivery window.  I thought if it is marked as a late delivery, then the bot looks back at your ship date and will mark it as a late shipment if it doesn’t show as “Accepted” by your expected ship date.  I could, and certainly hope I am, wrong.,
On top of that, if these don’t get delivered for weeks and we start getting a ton of A-to-Z’s, I’m not sure we’ll be protected with Buy Shipping because the “Accepted” scan wasn’t there in time.,
In the past, we have seen deliveries that once scanned as “Delivered”, all the previous scans appear out of nowhere.,This leaves me with even less confidence.  Now, it looks like I just dropped it off today.,
,USPS sees a very different path of the package than we do, whether you check through the buyers’ order page or the USPS website.,
In the situation of an aggressive buyer, if you contact your delivery supervisor they can tell you exactly where the package is enroute.,As long as your label was printed on time, your metric is not affected,
At this time of year nothing is unusual.,Even if the order is delivered late? The bot doesn’t look back at the first scan USPS makes?  What about if an A-to-Z is filed?,In terms of Late Shipment Rate the only thing that matters is that you have updated the order with tracking information either manually or by using Buy Shipping.,In terms of coverage against INR situations involving packages where you used Buy Shipping, the package is supposed to have been scanned by the carrier by the final date of your shipping window.  It does not necessarily need an acceptance scan, any scan from the carrier that proves it was shipped on time.,Late deliveries have no impact on your account, regardless of whether you shipped on time or not.  If a customer opens a claim solely for late delivery, you may lose any shipping charges you collected from the buyer, but you should not lose the amount you charged for the product if the package was delivered before the claim was opened.,Of course , owns Amazon.

Now he just chills out here in the forums.,Last week, we received 2 messages from customers advising us they have received the packages without being contacted! we were like what?? I am sure they received this message…,Well, that helps with half of our problem.  Here is the latest updated tracking. It shows as just being accepted today. All of the orders that shipped, with Buy Shipping. were picked up by our carrier last Monday. I watched her scan what I thought were our SCAN forms but it might just have been the Package Pickup request form.,
I’m guessing with this tracking, we won’t be protected from any INR claims, considering the ship by date was Dec. 9.,
,I feel your pain. I have a lot of those too. Look at these gems. The one in TX… Austin and Lufkin are roughly 4 hours away from each other.,I saw that.  That makes it look like you shipped late, regardless of whether you actually did or didn’t.,
This only matters if a claim a filed, in which case you would lose if the package was not delivered before the claim was filed.  However, there are reports of people losing claims even when the tracking shows they shipped on time, so you have to decide whether it’s worth the effort to have your packages scanned in or having SCAN forms scanned when you drop off/have them picked up.,Personally, I have everything scanned in or a form scanned, so at least when a buyer inquires I can show them I shipped on time and that it’s the carrier, not me that is causing the delay, with the hope they will be more understanding and patient.,I have a little under 700 orders as part of my ODR calculation.  So, I can only afford 6 neg feedbacks or A-to-Z’s before I get suspended.

Both intercepts are still showing they’re ‘In Progress’ on the USPS website.,I’m in Livonia it’s the same issue here, tracking looks like we shipped it late and everything is severely delayed.  Hell I have orders from late October still showing that and when covid first started I had an entire weeks worth of orders that took two months to start moving, not exaggerating…two months, it was hundreds of orders they all randomly popped up in Chicago one day, of course that was well after we had already re-shipped or refunded everyone.  We buy shipping through Amazon but directing them to file an AtoZ only works half the time it seems and the appeals get denied, no rhyme or reason to that either.,Previously when scan forms were scanned it would say “picked up”, now it’s saying what you displayed and from the people I talked to at USPS it’s being done on purpose to avoid liability.  When a customer themselves talks to some idiot in a cubicle at USPS trying to rush them off the phone they specifically tell them “we don’t have it yet” and then they come flip out on us of course.  I’m very friendly with all the local guys who pick up from us and even the supervisors, they are hard workers and they actually do care none of it is their fault they are just doing what they are being told.,A lot of bad stuff happening with our mail right now here in Michigan, it’s pretty shameful.

If you received one of these message, I do apologize. This was done by Amazon’s automated systems and is beyond my control.,, this is not an indication that the package is lost. I’m sure you’ve heard of all the issues the carriers (USPS, UPS, FedEx) are experiencing this holiday season, and there are significant delays throughout the country. A recent New York Times article estimated there would be 7.2 million more packages needing to be shipped each day this holiday season than the system has the capacity to handle. You can imagine the impact that is having.,Adding to that are the number of package handlers who work in the mail distribution centers who are suffering with COVID infections, or quarantining as a result of exposure. The net result is that some packages are going to be delayed, and a small amount of them will suffer significant delays. It appears that yours is one of these, and I am so sorry.,Rest assured that you will be taken care of though, and your order will be made right. If the package does ultimately arrive, you can return it (unused, of course) for a full refund if it is too late for your needs. If it is confirmed lost (it’s too early to determine this now, which is why Amazon’s message was so misguided), you will also receive a full refund.,It’s too soon to identify any package as lost currently because there are many, many orders , that are still showing as in transit/delayed in the carriers’ systems.,I hope you can be a bit more patient and give the mail personnel time to get caught up. They are working hard, despite the latest COVID resurgence, to support timely holiday delivery for all. As they work through the backlog, your package will either arrive (and you can return it if no longer needed), or we will be able to confirm it is indeed lost. Few packages actually do get lost though, it is far more likely you will receive the package significantly late, and then can return it if you no longer need it.,Again, I’m sorry and appreciate your understanding and continued patience,,

I was so terrified of losing another claim so I refunded them. But I can’t keep doing this. I barely slept last night. I make my living here and support three kids on my own. I’m definitely going to try and get away from Amazon after all of this is over.  It is appalling to me that they are getting away with this. And nothing will change so I guess its time to leave. I shop on here a lot too, but not anymore. I’d rather pay a little more somewhere else and give my money to a company that doesn’t treat people like this.,You shouldn’t have to do this at all. Did you exhaust all your appeals for this A-Z claim?,Hopefully I’m not the only seller willing to go to arbitration to make Amazon honor their own Buy Shipping INR policy.,hello is this the support group for USPS abuse, i’m present.,I don’t see the problem, honestly. A little customer service is all you need. , My orders show the same thing, packages shipped on Dec 7 still show nothing more than ‘Package has shipped’. When buyers ask, you just explain the issues the PO is having and reassure them that the package was actually shipped and they should see the tracking update shortly.,Here’s a sample response I sent to someone who suggested that I hadn’t bothered to mail their order yet -,Please don’t worry. It actually , been shipped, the reason you aren’t seeing evidence of that in the tracking number yet is that, due to the incredibly heavy volume of mail and packages they’re handling, USPS is skipping many of the outbound scans you would normally see and just moving the packages through without taking time to scan them. It’s usually about 3 days after actual shipping when the first scan shows up.,Our area, thankfully, hasn’t seen as many long delays as some areas. I’ve heard some USPS processing facilities in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Chicago are having delays of weeks. Besides record-breaking holiday volume, some are also dealing with having to shut down temporarily due to COVID outbreaks.,My guess is you should receive it Monday or Tuesday, based on the latest info about USPS delays that I’m aware of. Things are changing fast, so it could be a little longer than that, but I’m pretty confident in Monday or Tuesday.,Seller,When buyers reach out to us, we’re the authority figure and they’re seeking some guidance. Is what they’re seeing suggest what they think it does? (That we’re schmucks who haven’t bothered to ship their order) When you respond in a reassuring way, it puts their concerns at ease. That’s all most people are looking for. It also helps if you can share some of your expert knowledge about how the carriers are actually performing. We as sellers have a better sense of this than the average buyer does, and you can adjust their expectations, while still reassuring them at the same time.,By responding this way, it also gives the buyer insight into the problem, which might ward off some angry messages to , sellers they’ve ordered from. Win win all around.,Will packages arriving after last deliver by date affect seller account’s health/performance rating in a negative way? Even if packages were shipped out on time?,Part of the problem is when they click on the tracking number they are linked to Amazon’s abbreviated tracking information or sometimes totally rewritten information… in other words, not something that shows with the USPS tracking info at all. For example, Amazon tracking shows packaged delivered and customer does not have it. Well, if the customer actually was forwarded to the genuine USPS tracking link they would have seen it was delivered the previous day at exact time in the customer’s mailbox. I have found that packages that were once hand carried to the customer’s door are now being placed in the mailbox (when they will fit). Amazon needs to dispense with writing tracking info and simply link customers to the carrier’s tracking information! USPS nor any other carrier is not going to provide instructions saying your package may be lost so ask for a refund or replacement. This is a nightmare of Amazon’s choosing.,We’re not talking about a drop box. We are talking about a carrier pickup. As soon as you take it, you are responsible for it. Anything else is poor business practices.,Tell customers to ask for a replacement so we can bog down the mail system even MORE.,
Great way to makes things worse for the entire country, Amazon!,We have sent out dozens of refunds today alone. I can’t wait to see what this coming week brings…,Yes I am sure.,
We are picked up twice a day and USPS uses one of those big huge trucks to pick up.  The pick ups are not from our regular mail carrier.  There are several ecommerce shippers here in our center so they pick up here twice a day at this time of year, once daily between February and September.  .USPS offers this service if you can guarantee more than 80 packages a day.,
We have never used a scan form - the driver will take whatever is in our back loading area twice a day.  Most of the times these packages don’t see a scan for 2 or 3 days because they are never taken to our local post office, they are taken to a distribution center to be sorted.  Some are scanned there, some are just moved forward.  At this time of year we are lucky to see a scan 3 days out.,
Since our packages by pass a post office we don’t get that original scan you get with a scan formor during that initial sort.  We have never had a late shipment rate under 99%.,
So yes.  I am sure.,As long as you have printed the label on time, your late shipment rate will not be affected.,
Read my post above - our packages don’t go through a typical post office, they are picked up in bulk and taken directly to a distribution center.  We often don’t see a scan for 2 to 3 days.  At this time of year, we see some scans at delivery.,Where is Amazon’s management through all this? We are in the middle of a huge crisis and all we get is silence.,Yeah, 11/30/20 seems to be a black hole of shipping.  I have over 25 packages still showing not delivered for that date.  I ve had so many issues since then too, shipping USPS 1st class, that Ive just decided to pull my popular $13 item(<35k in BSR in toys) off of AMZ until the new year, not worth the profit margin with the lost items, refunds, and lost postage.  I even tried to recoup the ones with shipping insurance, always denied.  Just not worth the headache at the moment and whatever repercussions AMZ will hit us with for late/no deliveries.,
PS, I hand deliver these to my PO and watch them scan them all.,USPS 1st class and priority are both getting hung up in the post 11/30/20-Present wormholes.  I still have priority shipments that havent been delivered for 2 weeks and over too.  Only thing about using priority, you do at least get included insurance, but Ive tried to file claims and no luck there either…so…  both are a crap shoot at this point.,It would be nice to change the handling time in shipping settings, because all of my products are shipped in one day.  You need to go to each product’s edit listing on the offer page to change the handling time.  Thank you.,Thanks for responding. Just as I feared.,We’ve gone in and extended our shipping window for standard shipping orders. Anyone who wants it guaranteed will have to pay extra and we’ll ship those with Fedex/UPS. We’re still going to be biting into our profits though seems we have no choice. We can’t afford having more customers complaining."

They need to notify customers of the severity of USPS problems,"Selling on Amazon,Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns","It’s really not a stupid USPS concept.  Imagine someone sending a $1000 package insured, never was scanned, but then filed a claim.  That would be a dream for scammers.,

Most of these refund requests we’re getting were shipped on that date.,Consider yourself lucky if it’s only your first.,We even had a customer yesterday writing to us ‘Can I have a refund because my package arrived late?’ It was only 1 day later than specified, but I guess she also received a message from Amazon advising her to request a refund, so why shouldn’t she?,I have had the same problem and also USPS updates are not showing until they get to a main hub near there destination very strange. I do know they are short handed due to Covid and I was told no over time and that some sorting machine have been removed from may USPS locations.  I do not no how true all of this is but it would explain alot of issues with USPS.,The possibility of having one’s Selling Privilege revoked is actually what worries me the most about this situation - as our friend RacingRox points out upthread, Amabots that police this kind of thing are only as good as their programmed parameters permit, and Lord Knows there’s precious-little evidence that the parameters set for the programmer’s efforts have much of a tendency to take full account of all-possible scenarios, or of the unintended consequences that a failure to do so often present.,Still, it must be admitted (albeit, perhaps begrudgingly, given the track record of previous years) that Amazon actually , demonstrated a greater degree flexibility in this area than was it’s pre- , wont, so:,Also doesn’t work for Amazon fulfilled orders. Still have orders 2 weeks old sitting in the,
“unshipped” list.,Can anyone advise if Priority packages currently seem to be moving faster than First Class?,There seems to be conflicting opinions on whether there is any difference on the speed between the two in general. Our shipper told us that the only difference is that First Class only works up to a a certain weight though others have said that Priority IS indeed prioritized for faster shipments.,If anyone has insight I would really appreciate it. We’d be willing to absorb the extra cost if it will make a difference and mean less complaints (and less chance of negative affects on our account metrics).,Actually, these Amazon’s statements are A CONFUSING LIE. In April and May, when USPS had similar, serious delays, EVERY ONE OF THE PACKAGES LACKING A SCAN AND DELAYED WERE EVENTUALLY DELIVERED. NOT LOST. Got that, Amazon??? Amazon, you are a dangerous, duplicitous, fraudulent machine.,So annoyed we have 30 orders just from November 30th stuck at USPS.  As a result, I updated my USPS shipping templates to collect shipping costs so I can affordably ship everything UPS/FedEx.  Amazon shut my listings down for potential pricing error.  These items are like 7.50-$15. It’s like wtf.  My max price is not below the price + shipping costs.  Again all items under $15 with $8 shipping cost on the template."
Why is Amazon notifying customers that USPS packages are lost and to ask for a replacement? They need to notify customers of the severity of USPS problems,"Selling on Amazon,Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns","For the examples you sent, you are correct but I can show you 15 or 20 that don’t fit your scenario.,I know what is happening to us and our customers with Priority mail and those are the examples I am concerned with.,I wouldn’t do this. The USPS backlogs are taking place at the distribution centers and Priority Mail is substantially delayed just as First Class Mail. Good customer service on your part yes, but now you will likely have two packages delayed going to the same customer and you may never get one of them back.,Last week I saw a UPS delivery guy delivering packages from a rented U HAUL truck.

“”,
Hello from Amazon Selling Partner Support,,I understand your concern regarding delay in delivering your products by carriers across the US.,On checking your Orders I could see that you have done your portion perfectly such as shipped on time and provided tracking details to the buyers.,Further checking Buyer Seller Messaging, I have found that you have educated the buyers in Professional manner and explained the situation in detail about carrier delays as well.,In case, if the buyer requesting refund only, ask the buyers to raise a return request and initiate refund once you have received item.,For return requests that do not fall into the Prepaid Returns Label program, we recommend that you respond to return requests within 24 hours.

“”,I spoke with a very knowledgeable person at seller support a few days ago. I was inquiring about something else but I mentioned the USPS delay and how it would affect refunds etc… She recommended I send a message to buyers letting them know about the delay at USPS. I had never thought about doing that and was surprised she suggested it. I’ve extended all of my shipping and handling times to the farthest they can be and I’ve added expedited shipping through UPS that seems to be helping sales not halt. Best of luck to you and I’m sorry to hear of the headaches and stress this is causing.,Now add a Noreaster on Wednesday on East Coast, uggh, I spoke to a number of companies like ours that ships a few thousand small packages a week this time of year, who cant afford Fedex UPS for little items.  1 USPS is slammed, we all know that at this point.  2 - The young people at all these companies we try to hire, dont want to work, dont want to work if they show up to work, complain about not getting a job, at our jobs, while not working (I guess they only want to be famous bloggers)  and if they do work they mess up or quit quickly because its work. 2020 is whacky, more sales great, more, more problems than ever bad. Bottom line you ship your item right away is the only fact we can control, sadly thats not the fact to metrix.  Holiday wish list 1 - All shipping metrix after we drop item off should be a metrix for the USPS or carriers only, not us, ha ha wow imagine if that was true.  2 - Postive feedback rating for all orders completed with out complaint after 6 months so companies who ship 1000’s of packages only get 47 positive feedback for the year.  3 - No more insane product violations for licensed products the auto scan bots mess up and violations for names like Fred, I cant sell any of my Fred Flinstone products because Amazon bots eliminate them all as product violations of the name Fred, and that just one example.  4 - pictures of dogs on our long term products that sell every few months after 4 years. 5 - 1000 more wishes Im sure  - still  thank you Amazon for the food on my table and the roof over my head.  Good Luck Stay Safe Stay Well All.,They should also add to that message: “We are also in cahoots with Amazon and giving them top preference on making sure their packages arrive on time while we hold yours in a back room for up to 2 weeks before they start moving again.”,Here’s the one I send customers…,I would take whatever seller support tells you with a grain of salt.  You will get different responses from every one you talk to about the same issue.  NO, what AMAZON should do is put a message out to THEIR customers on behalf of all 3rd party sellers letting them know they should expect these delays.,We had over 40 today.  Amazon is screwin us.,I’ve been getting a surge of customers demanding refunds because they received this very message.  It’s a real thing.,2020 can’t be over fast enough…,And Amazon has the nerve to send us surveys such as , do you feel Amazon supports your business, do you feel CSR’s are responsive, Amazon will make your business grow…,Give me a break Amazon.  Exclude me, better yet just a few more days out from 90 days last sale to I exit this mess.  Moving completely to ebay.,Yes, I’m rural and they’ve been using rental trucks for months. I didn’t connect the dots though with why packages keep getting delivered wrong.,USPS uses this stupid concept that a package is not their responsibility until it arrives at the PO and is “accepted” by the USPS. While the carrier has it, it is “pending acceptance”.  Amazon and everyone else takes this to mean “not picked up”.,To add insult to injury, the USPS system does not appear to populate ANY tracking info until either a acceptance scan or a delivery scan occurs. So if someone in the USPS is stealing/losing packages that haven’t been “accepted”, they simply vanish. And to the customer it appears as if you never shipped it.,The USPS is a horrible carrier to do business with.,My experience with the policy is that they will only fund the refund for INR IF the package is marked as “delivered”.,I own a restaurant AND sell on Amazon.  Fun times :/.,They funded a customer out of pocket for and INR where the tracking number hasn’t been updated since the 28th.  I didn’t even know my customer filed an A to Z until I got an email from Amazon saying they refunded her."
Why is Amazon notifying customers that USPS packages are lost and to ask for a replacement? They need to notify customers of the severity of USPS problems,"Selling on Amazon,Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns","Nearly every single message I’m getting about items not arriving via USPS, the customers are saying that Amazon has notified them that their package is likely lost, and they ask for a replacement. If I sent replacements which I don’t have, they’d just get stuck in transit was well. Amazon needs to step up and notify customers when we as sellers purchased USPS postage through Amazon buy shipping that their package is not lost, but that it is delayed due to unforeseen strain on the postal system. USPS only added this to their site this morning “ALERT: USPS IS EXPERIENCING UNPRECEDENTED PACKAGE INCREASES AND LIMITED EMPLOYEE AVAILABILITY DUE TO THE IMPACTS OF COVID-19. WE APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE AND REMAIN COMMITTED TO DELIVERING THE HOLIDAYS TO YOU.” it still doesn’t fully explain the true severity of the delays, Amazon can’t continue to ignore this, Amazon needs to step up and help change customer expectations and the reality that packages are sitting in hubs and trailers, they are not lost, USPS is just overwhelmed, as is Fedex and UPS.,I was not aware of this until the past 24 hours when messages started pouring in, I had only gotten one other in the past week and thought it was a fluke, I was still at a high OTD but it’s dropped in the last couple days, but then yesterday I got 5 INR messages and 4 so far today, but I know now that I have packages that are stuck in transit as far back as Nov 25th. I was under the impression that things that had shipped early would make it, I thought carriers were prepared to meet most of the demand. But the Midwest and Colorado have become black holes for all packages, all areas severed in the midwest, or that have passed though are stuck as “arriving late”,All of my call backs about package traces, are generally coming from the Indiana hub, and I’m told they will try to find it, but that they have just too much mail piled up and it will be very difficult. Amazon needs to address this as they did the delays during the first covid shutdows back in March/April.,I’ve changed all my remaining in stock items to 5-8 day delivery so they all read as “likely won’t arrive before Christmas”  I’m just wanting Amazon to step up and stop notifying customers that their orders are lost, they are not lost, they are stuck in trailers, containers and hubs, they will arrive, just not when expected,Anything Amazon does will displease buyers or sellers. The transportation system is in melt down. Other than the portion controlled by Amazon logistics, Amazon cannot count on any carrier they use or their sellers use.,I assume they weighed whether to take action and decided that this way was the way to go because it offered the buyers Amazon’s support and any costs would be borne by sellers who could not adequately manage their buyers.,In the same position, I might not send the message, but I never ran the most trusted company in the US.,As bad is it might feel to have to deal with this situation, it is far better than owning a restaurant.,That seems to be the reality, and it makes me really angry to think about, Amazon keeps their profits up and passed the burden to us. It’s ridiculous that right now Amazon shipping is still telling me first class mail can make it locations by Friday, which is 100% impossible.,, I would humbly recommend drafting a really reassuring email as a template advising customers of the holdups and delays and that you have initiated a package trace request to get their package moving, and then immediately sending it to customers whose packages are stranded for weeks.,Reference that they may see a message on the Amazon website that the package is lost, but that it is not lost. It’s just an automatic message Amazon has put on. Tell them that all the carriers are just running behind because of an unprecedentedly high number of packages and unprecedentedly low number of staffers due to the virus surge. Reiterate that the package will get to them.,Do it before they see the Amazon message and decide the package is lost and they should ask for a refund.,It seems entirely reasonable for customers to believe the package is lost message, since they have not heard anything from your end for weeks and the website is showing no tracking. You need to counter that.,It’s always been my impression that Amazon doesn’t want you to contact customers for delays until they contact you, I don’t want to do anything that can cause me more issues down the road. I’m currently at  95.96% on time Thursday I was at 96.7%. If it’s ok for me to notify customers of delays I will totally do it, I would be more reassuring to see a seller being proactive, rather than simply reacting to a message,USPS is telling them that, and it is still 100% impossible.,Our friend , posted a screenshot, about an hour ago & provided by a member of the Buyer Community, of what that customer saw on their mobile device regarding this:,That makes me sick to my stomach to see, in the words of the Tiger King, I don’t think I’m going to financially recover from this.,Are we still allowed to send customers this?,You may be eligible to request a refund under the A-to-z Guarantee if “You have not received your package and three days have passed since the maximum estimated delivery date or the tracking shows a delivery confirmation, whichever is sooner.

Now I think that SCAN form doesn’t mean that you ship particular package.,Amazon is not using the USPS recommended transit times and has not been for some time now.,Exactly, Amazon doesn’t care if they delay prime orders sometimes for weeks, they even just schedule a new delivery day, but if sellers have delivery issues out of their control, they better be ready to pay up,The message that , linked to is the reason why I was telling you to contact buyers proactively.,I personally WOULD NOT send them the A to Z message right now. Amazon A to Z is not working like before. Amazon is docking sellers left and right on A to Z claims. People are noting that in thread after thread.,I think reaching out to a buyer and letting them know the package is delayed because of unprecedented volumes but is still on its way to you, is just good customer service. It should not be the buyer’s job to research and write notes and chase after Amazon customer service. Keep them in the loop, so they can worry about something else – as is everyone has a long list of things to worry about right now, they do not need to add an Amazon order to the list.,I have messages like that from both Amazon and Old Navy, currently. I see the messages in my inbox, look at them briefly and say, okay, so it is still going to get to me before Christmas, no big deal. In contrast, I have spent a considerable amount of time chasing after Office Depot yesterday and today, with not even the courtesy of ""We are sorry your package delivery is delayed.

A CONTSANT onslaught of customers getting the same email from Amazon and asking for replacements/refunds.  I have a template made up, which seems to settle many of them, but some are not patient what-so-ever.  If you refund, they will 99% chance receive their order for free in the coming week or two.  This is stressing me our SO MUCH.  It is ridiculous Amazon is not setting good expectations with customers.,We understand that Amazon is obsessed with pleasing the buyer but this is certifiably insane.,
If Amazon wants to do this , should be funding the refunds in our humble opinion.,It’s not good for FBA sellers either.,
We have quite a few refunds issued by Amazon for “Delivered Late By Carrier” from which there is no,
reimbursement ,  given.,I’ve talked to 9 buyers in the last 24 hrs ,Agreed.,In both scenarios (FBM and FBA), Scamazon is playing the “pretty princess”, who does no wrong, while placing the fiasco on The Seller, in the case of FBM and on The Carrier, in the case of FBA."

Thank,Also is this new or always been this way: Amazon may strike-through feedback in the following cases:,You’re in luck, Cakes - Amazon does indeed offer that capability for BSS (‘Amazonese’ for “Buy Shipping Service(s)”); you can begin to learn more about how to leverage that feature from the SHC’s (my shorthand for “Seller Help Content”) ,.,That revision of the SHC’s , is not “,”, but it was added by the Editorial Team , - in May 2018, as announced in that month’s very first News Headline ,.,Thank you soooo much.,My account has been deactivated because of usps, late shipping  metrics ,  November and into all of December usps were late on picking up packages  to be sent out,
And the ones that were out for delivery never got to the buyers on time or haven’t received them yet and it’s dec 31 st,
So they shut me down because 35% of my shipping was late ,I had more then 50% of my sales refunded to my buyers because of them,You are most welcome, my friend - Happy New Year to You and Yours!,Have you checked your shipping settings?,I did max those out but I want more of a cushion. We ship everything in 1 business day but I need the handling time longer to compensate for longer shipping times. Do I make sense?,I know what you mean (I think), but there are two different areas to update the handling time.,The first way is in the product listing. When you edit the product, you can change the handling time there.,The other way is within the shipping template that’s assigned to the product listing. There’s a checkbox for “Handling Time: Same Day”. For the longest time, I didn’t realize this box was checked, which was overriding the handling time of 3 days that I manually entered into my product listing. You don’t see this field when you’re just reviewing the shipping template. You only see it when you actually edit it. Once I unchecked that box, then my product listing showed the 3 day handling time that I had entered.,But we’re they scanned ?,They just lose your inventory and it’s never found again so no reimbursements. FC transfers take forever. I used to be strictly FBA but not anymore. Check in times are bad for products. Good Luck !,At this point, I am cautiously optimistic that all the backlog is getting into the mail stream and new orders are getting back to almost regular shipping times.,
Back to Active Inventory for 2021.,I changed by delivery time to 5-8 days for the lower 48 under edit. Now how can I change my handling time from 1 day to another amount in mass amounts?,The thread below may help answer your question:,Does the Buy Shipping policy protect you if you intercept the package before delivery?,(post withdrawn by author, will be automatically deleted in 24 hours unless flagged),From Amazon Seller Support. They sent me the template below, though I’ve yet to be able to find it on my own in the ‘add products via upload’ section.

Anyone else shut down shop until USPS is caught up?,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","We shut down temporarily to address an internal issue about the 10th. Then, right before I was going to put everything back on, I started seeing all of the threads talking about USPS delivery problems and Amazon’s suggestion to ask for refunds. I decided to leave it off. I’m turning it back on right now. I’m sure we lost a bunch of business, but we were so busy handling our own site and eBay, I figured it wasn’t worth the headache.,
Only thing I do regret is not having the time to adjust pricing for some of our hotter items for FedEx 2day delivery.,I know up north they are having huge problems with covid19,Got a Priority Mail shipment stuck in VA since the 16th. Customer furious.,No, we sell mostly seasonally related items, so this is an important time for us.  We have had many first class and some priority items (mostly flat rate boxes/envelopes) delayed, but in comparison to the sales and those that got through, I do not think it merits closing down.,
Talk to me again when I get a bad feedback, that’s going to really upset me, as we have not sent out a single package late and we have often upgraded the shipping if we had the margin, and sometimes even when we did not.,
My messaging to buyers with delayed mail has resulted in them being very patient and understanding.   I have let them know that they can just wait to receive it and then return it at no charge…and that I also put on a USPS trace so that should a package be declared lost by USPS, then they will get an immediate refund.  Once explained like this, no one has come back demanding a refund on a delayed item.,
Bottom line, this is my livelihood and I do not understand how people can afford to just shut down business during some of the best selling weeks of the year, but we all know our own business and needs best.,
Happy Holidays to all, we will get through this together…,How can a “collectible” toy be “brand new” and available at Target?,I don’t sell toys, so that’s why I’m asking.,Nothing has moved USPS for me from the 16th. I wouldn’t use yet if you have other options.,
I am on the east coast.,I’m not reopening yet. I know USPS back log is not cleared out yet. It’s just not worth it in my opinion. My tracking keeps tanking even though I shipped same day as ordered so aggravating !! Amazon does not have our back…,Nope, not when you ship using Amazon’s postage, and ship on time.  And by “on time” I mean, for God’s sake, ship it the same day or next.  Don’t make the customer wait the entire ship window.  That just pisses people off.,I just put my account on vacation because we’re supposed to get snow and ice tomorrow.  The snow isn’t too bad but the ice makes things unpredictable.  I’ll reactivate it when the weather looks better.,I put my account in vacation mode today.  I need a mental health break!,WOW,Yes I supposed I was lucky. But I’d rather take that chance than to give my money away without trying.,My last seasonal FBM order was 12/15. After that I moved all seasonal items to zero quantity and Im so glad I did. I have already had too many packages not arrive in time. All FBA orders are still being sold.

In hopes of getting the US Senators to vote YES to the $2000 stimulus bill that has passed in the House. I wrote to my PA senators. Bob Casey had this on his contact page (and we thought we had it bad):,I always ship the same day or next. When I took the mail out yesterday, I already had mail in the box and couldn’t remember if we had gotten it on Saturday or not. But I put my 7 outgoing orders in the box at 11 AM. Around 4 PM the flag was still up and I got a sick feeling in my stomach thinking of what 7 late packages would do to my metrics. Late last night I remembered that I was supposed to get some packages yesterday so I checked to see their status. They had been delivered at 4:52 PM. For sure a substitute driver and my carrier would never be that late! We still can’t get our car out from the snow we got on Christmas day, but hubby has to get it out so I can go to the doctor tomorrow.,I got tons of packages stuck somewhere unknown and are way too late. I decided to send my shop to Amazon warehouse. Kidding! But definitely will do FBA more.,
Will Amazon protect loss because customers return due to arriving late? i.e. Will it cover return postage?,We put our account in vacation mode on December 10th and most likely will leave it there permanently. For the last ten days my wife and I have done nothing but respond to Amazon customers (some understanding, most extremely rude) about their shipments. We have eaten thousands of dollars in refunds and will probably get hit with thousands more before it is over. Amazon has not only failed to help, they have encouraged their customers to demand refunds by lying to them and telling them their package is lost when they know it is just delayed due to high package volume and a lack of workers due to COVID.,We might continue to sell FBA, but I have no interest in ever shipping to an Amazon customer again.,I’m in MD. Temporarily shut it down on Dec.16th. Waiting until USPS gets caught up…which unfortunately seems like a long wait. Too many angry customers due to USPS slowdown…thought it would be cleared up by now.

Too bad we get blamed for ruining Christmas! ,I didn’t put my shop on hold and wish I had.  The lost or in limbo orders are mounting up. The thing that annoys me most is the arbitrary “deliver by” date that Amazon places on orders that customers feel is gospel.  Holding the seller responsible for the inadequacies of shipping services is ridiculous.,USPS problems started showing up for me last week of November. I talked to 3 postmasters at sorting stations in different parts of the country and all three told me basically the same thing - The temporary help the they hired for the season didn’t show for work and many of their regular employees are out sick for extended periods of time.,The problem with eBay is if you have your handling time set to say, 15 days to cover for the actual delivery times for 1st Class Package or Priority, eBay does not reflect that in the updated estimated delivery date they show to the buyer when the package gets its first scan. The buyer can file INR if not received 1-day after the EDD.,

We have been completely up front and honest with our customers throughout the pandemic, we haven’t played guessing games, engaged in half - truths etc. and I will say that the majority of customers have been surprisingly understanding and content to wait it out for the most part and Amazon has thus far held up their end funding the A to Z claims customers have filed either on their own, or at our suggestion when there was no other path forward.,No USPS.

I sold a $60 dollar toy and the person wanted a refund because they thought the brand new item had been previously opened. I just kept repying for him to return the item for a full refund and he eventually stopped replying. Another was a $300 collectible toy (brand new), which the buyer found for a better price on target.

UPS is also not a practical option because their normal costs are a couple of dollars more (in an area where there’s a lot of shipping-cost sensitivity) and technically they also have a surcharge on the packaging type that the USPS doesn’t that amounts to more than the total cost otherwise. They appear inconsistent in enforcing this (some returns have gone by UPS), but there’s still ambiguity. Changing the packaging type would just be exchanging extra costs on the shipping side for extra costs on the materials side.,Now I’ll just be returning to pre-Christmas season mode and stretching out the handling times and projected delivery times and probably dropping expedited shipping. After the July-August period when things started to really get bad, I went to 9 days on the handling and close to the max on the transit time. It didn’t cost too many sales. Will try 4 days handling on this go-round with most things actually going out within 2, but I may have to bump it up.,How long have you sold on Amazon? You really think Amazon will support you? I am sorry to say, don’t count on it!! Their automation has no clue how do deal with exceptional times. Buyers will file an A-Z claim, and we will lost almost all of them!,
I asked Amazon about this, and they just tell me to contact USPS and report it. USPS will just laugh at you if you can actually even reach someone. As long as it arrives in 4-6 weeks, they are satisfied. This is direct from an office manager!,
So good luck with Amazon, I hope you have better luck than I do. They might kill my business if they do not begin to support sellers better with USPS Crap.,
USPS should be blown up and restarted as a new company! They have millions of shipments setting around in distribution centers.,
I had a worker tell me that offices and distribution centers are shut down due to the virus, and workers are afraid to touch or scan items. I have hundreds of shipments that are not being scanned…some ANYWHERE!! I had a shipment from PA to Bronx NY go to TX, then to NJ distribution center, then back to TX, all because NO ONE WANTS TO DEAL WITH PACKAGES during COVID. They systems are horrid, and that is the most polite I can be with them.,Fed Ex left a perishable package out on pouring rain (an all-day rain). Driver should be fired!,Usps picked up for me today.,My shipping standards are similar to yours, but if the buyer does not get their shipment in 2 weeks or less, all that is meaningless. My standards are galaxies above those of USPS (they don’t give a *%$# as long as most of their shipments arrive in 4-6 weeks), and USPS could sink my business due to their shut downs, fears, and just inability to know how to handle Holiday increases.,
I probably shipped 800 orders this month and about 5% arrived on time, 20% arrived by Christmas.,
My high standards mean nothing if buyers don’t get their orders!,I would have to say that eBay has once again done a much better job with communicating the situation with carriers to buyers than Amazon. They even integrated a disclaimer into their “check tracking” feature. Amazon is so wedded to get-it-there-yesterday as a part of the business model that they can be like Baghdad Bob with customers.,Fortunately the news media also has been covering the record volumes and problems they’re causing, and that has caused most buyers to be blessedly understanding (there’s always that notable exception or two).,I totally agree. I had an eBay customer who had an order shipped to her old address. She had moved. eBay was easy to work with, and closed the case, as I had shipped the package the address she provided and had proof of delivery.,On amazon I had a nasty buyer who was PO because her mothers last minute gift was not there. She left me a 1…said I had shipped it late on purpose. Total lie. I was surprised that the robot struck through the feedback. I am so sick of entitled people.,Well high standards…I think most of Amazon sellers have high standards, and go beyond to treat the buyers nicely. However the buyer on amazon feels pretty entitled …so don’t think you work any harder that the rest of us.,We have entitled sellers on here also.,
Thank God that 2020 is almost over and we still have a couple tough months to get through.,How is your On-Time Delivery Rate looks like? Mine is down to 89%,Yes, as of two weeks ago. A hit for $ but better than a hit on metrics or worse chance of account suspension. Have been in touch with all my buyers on the Bay whose packages are taking too long, keeping them informed of Order status and it has gone quite well overall. Had Amazon allowed us to contact buyers things could have gone much better. There would still be pills but good communication goes a long way toward happier customers. Here’s to a better 2020 for all.,I have never encountered an instance where the USPS was held accountable for not meeting “their obligations for delivery” when it comes to everyday, ordinary mail.,As far as I can tell, they have no actionable “obligations” unless insurance or “promised-by” delivery dates are involved.,Even more so in these uncertain times, I would think.,If you are still selling, at least go to setting and shipping.  You can easily change the shipping time to the max, which should cover the USPS lag.  Handling times are not as easy to change from the website, you would have to use the spreadsheet method as far as i know.  Correct me if i am wrong.,My son closed down after he hit what he estimated to be $1000 in losses after a year that he was making less anyhow as so many thrifts were closed and his other business is dead in the water (process serving). So he quit while he was ahead. When I talked to him on the phone the other day he told me that Columbus, OH has two warehouses on the other side of the city from each other and they have their own driver’s. I really believe it. I ordered something for my little one yesterday, not thinking it would get there until next week or year. I got a picture of it on their porch this morning! I got my first request for a refund today as an order is dead in the water. I sent her to ask Amazon and then reminded her that if she gets a refund she needs to send the package back when it arrives or repay for it and also mentioned how honest I thought most sewers are. I don’t understand how many buyers, get their refund and then with the item shows up, they think they got a freebie instead of that they are stealing from the seller/Amazon."

I’ve refunded two orders that subsequently were ready for delivery, but I used package intercept so no one gets anything for free. So far I’ve received one request for refund thanks to Amazon’s helpful “order is lost, ask for refund” [so , Amazon has our back on this /s]. There are a few shipments that are in limbo now - if that number increases I’ll go on vaca for while.,I shut off all the items I normally send Usps on the 11th and am continuing with only items I send UPS for the remainder of the month. UPS is usually $2 more for smaller packages but there are no headaches or stress with it, better tracking, faster delivery times, and much better customer service.,nope still rocking and rolling… so far everything has arrived  quite a few late but no issues of money being returned because of late… did have a few arrogants that demanded but packages arrived and i probably made them feel stupid with my tactful responses it like do you watch the news or look at your tracking it clearly states it will arrive late… we ship same day till 8 pm delivered to the carrier… so our shipping standard is way above amazon…,Didn’t skip a beat…still selling and we really haven’t had too many issues.  The occasional A-Z and “where’s my package?” was expected and has been manageable so far.,I can’t afford to close shop. Amazon is my only source of income. I have had way more, “Where’s my stuff?” messages this year than ever before but most people have been understanding that everything is going to be delivered late.,Good luck with that, I have had two AZ Claims, where items were shipped through Amazon but bogged down in USPS. They were both shipped the day of the order but were missing scans from USPS.  Amazon awarded both of them and charged me.  One was delivered the date they ruled on my appeal.  I have been messaging all my buyers and keeping them informed on the location of their packages, hoping to avoid more claims.,When I use USPS for FBM I never trust them to scan and either use the form if it is more than 5 items or make them do it and give me a receipt if less. I use Amazon shipping not my USPS account and am in Metro NYC. So far all late deliveries on my books (media mail - economy free shipping  migrtated template have not been marked against my account.

Anyone else shut down shop until USPS is caught up?,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","Yes.

ANYONE ELSE FIND AMAZON SUPPORT IS NON-EXISTENT IF YOU ARE THE SELLER AND PAYING THEM?

Worst decision I made thinking they would be the “customer service” I thought. WRONG!..,No?

Also, I’m not talking about $10 her and there…I have lost $100 her and there…and if you use their UPS you cannot file claim because it is under THEIR ACCOUNT…so I don;t know if they received funds back from UPS and just kept it!

I had some other biggest stuff that was listed for a year and a half, and someone bought 4 related items for $1,400. Had i been closed, they may have never sold,One of the nice people from the post office that called me on one of my myriad of delayed package inquiries told me they are being told that this may not all get sorted out for 2 months.  We were discussing a package that shipped out on 12-1 via priority just 2 states over.  I could have walked the package there and gotten back home by now.,I’m not sure shutting down until the post office clears their backlog is a valid option.  I have left my handling time the same, but maxed out the shipping/transit time for every zone.

We ship on time and use Amazon Buy Shipping.   We are hopeful that if the packages aren’t delivered on time, then we will be protected by the Amazon Buy Shipping policy which states that a seller is not liable if there’s problems with delivery.   That should include late delivery since we are using a carrier that they are recommending us use in our Buy Shipping option.,So far, most of our customers who have had delivery issues are content to wait, or content to return the item once it arrives for a full refund if no longer needed.   Our metrics are still in the “Good” zone, and we ship about 40-60 packages per day.,We had initially bumped our handling time to 10 days and set transit time to the max 5-8 days. However, we felt this still was not enough to present the buyer with a reasonably projected max delivery date. Therefore, we set all inventory to 0 for the time being. Outside of Amazon, we are shipping with UPS and on-time deliveries are the norm.,I put my store on vacation from the 15th through the 18th.,I figured before the 15th I had a decent chance of getting packages delivered on time if they were sent UPS, and after that people would know that their package would not make it on time - because Amazon was telling them that it wouldn’t.,In between was the period of uncertainty.

UPS 3-day packages, sent on the 14th, were always delivered within three days, and UPS ground made it within 5 to 8 days.  The slowest package of the bunch shipped on the 14th was just delivered yesterday.,If I were wiser - or more paranoid - I would have shipped UPS for the entire month of December.  I still have two media mail packages, shipped on the 4th and 5th, that have not been delivered.,Regardless, a short staycation was good for my sanity; and maybe even for my ODR.,We sell items people need, not want. We take our chances with the delays and set 8 day handling time and max econ shipping for our MF items.

I stopped around the 10th because of troubling reports for shipping. Yes, I have been affected by it all but not as much as I expected. Stopping earlier than planned helped mitigate some of the losses I think I would have had.

My guess is that what usually happens is out the window now.,This is not an option. They charge $14 for this service. That is too much.,Too much when you shipped $20 item, there are sellers who are out $50 or more, those may try to take that route.  My average sale  is $26 so this option usually does not work for me, I just thought I will throw in this idea for the sellers who are out high ticket items.,HAHA Funny one! Wrong date tough, USPS is raising rates for everyone on January 24th, no matter where you buy postage. There’s no way to avoid it!,This is good in theory but when you have a 100 or more packages a day go out who has the time to track all of them by the end of shipping time.  Each package could have different arrival dates and shipping destinations.,This option does not work for me because we sell $30 items so paying $14 will be a loss. What I can not understand why a seller has to struggle so much about this. It should not be this way.  If the package has not arrived because the carrier has issues or problems we should not be penalized for it. If I do not receive something I would never blame the seller. If I pay priority mail I should be able to open a claim with the carrier and if I paid for First class with no insurance, me as a buyer, I should be responsible for the loss. Small businesses are struggling already with the pandemic and this situation is making the problem worsen.,I don’t understand the math. If you do nothing, then the buyer gets to keep a $30 item and you lose $30. If you successfully intercept the package, at a cost of $14, then you can resell it leaving you $16 ahead -vs- doing nothing.,I feel your pain hun! I am in the same boat. I am a small one-person handmade seller and I have literally sacrificed time away from my family this holiday season busting my butt to get my orders out to customers and due to the massive USPS issues I am out so much money, time away from family, my ODR is now over 1% and I have to come up with a plan of action for “how to prevent orders from getting delayed in the future”…like Ummm, ok, yeah…let me think how I can control USPS and their delays during a pandemic where 50% more packages are going out during a holiday season because people can’t spend actual time visiting family and friends…yep, this should go great. They are now also holding over $18,000 of my money while my “account is in review”. I am so disappointed in AMZ and how they are handling this. Everywhere else has notifications up stating the massive and unprecedented delays this holiday season and to allow additional days to deliver items but AMZ had absolutely nothing up. I even had customers wondering why they weren’t at all made aware prior to ordering or made aware there were delays affecting their packages. I obviously did a ton of copy and paste emails explaining the situation but it doesn’t help that half these people don’t even see them and have no darn idea where to even access emails from sellers. So unfortunate. So disappointed,I am sorry but your math is not correct. The initial cost for this item is $12 then now we have to paid an extra $14 to intersect it and to resell it again on ad/ keywords is around 20% to 30% per item so I do not see the $16 ahead you are referring to. Second, after paying $14 chances are that Us Mail never find the item and gives you any excuse to steal your money, they denied all the insurance included on these shipments, I can not believe a government’s company do this to small business. Also, I prefer my client to receive the items after waiting for so many weeks. Also, they can leave negative feedback for never receiving the package.,But if you intercept the item and it is returned, you will not lose the initial $12 cost of the item. As far as ads go, the 20-30% you provided is quite high. Regardless, you will still spend that same amount on the next sale whether its the item you intercept or not.,They only bill you if the intercept is successful.,IMO, there are way too many sellers failing to intercept packages. This has emboldened Amazon’s customers to demand refunds and get products for free. Regardless, I understand time is money and in some cases it is not worthwhile to intercept some packages. But in your case, I most definitely would not let the buyer get a free product when I would be better off financially if I intercepted the package.,It seems like there must be a news story in here somewhere–Amazon is making record profits during the pandemic, but is screwing small sellers over USPS delays and list packages,,Appeal worked for us for the single A-Z calim.

consider,While it will cost you $$ to get the package back, that intercept and shipping the package back on high value items may be worth the effort,Just throwing this idea in here for those who are not familiar with it,Happy New Year Everyone!,Just wanted to elaborate where the SafeT claim is mentioned, in case you need it,on that page scroll all the way down and you will see:,  The Seller Assurance for e-Commerce Transactions (SAFE-T) process allows you to file a claim for reimbursement if you want to appeal Amazon’s decision to issue a refund to a customer. At Amazon’s sole discretion, you may be issued a reimbursement in cases where Amazon determines that you were not at fault. To know more, refer ,.,I tried the package intercept (buyer had already been refunded with my money) .  put in my priority tracking # and USPS site said it was not eligible.  of course, it is…  I even called the PO in the town that the package was going to.  they said they could not intercept it.  so that was that.,did everything right  (shipping, PO acceptance scan but late delivery) but refund was seller funded,
have already had the claim denied, appeal denied, support case: no change & closed),
going to try the safe-t claim.,
if that fails, saw a suggestion (post 155, I think)  to file with the FCC in washington,
not letting this go…,I attempted to open a Safe-T claim on a denied A-to-z claim order and received this message;,This order is not eligible for SAFE-T claim. Only Seller Fulfilled Prime orders, MFN Prepaid Return Label orders, Easy Ship orders and VAS orders, are eligible for SAFE-T claims. Please refer to Amazon SAFE-T Claim Policy for more details"
A-Z Claim granted against me but it's not my fault -Damn Postal Service,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","Ok, I found where to change transit times, but the max transit time for me is 5 to 8 days. I have orders that are going on 14 to 18 days. The max is 8 days.,This is to be expected on amazon because part of the value this platform adds is quick shipping, most customers expect their item to arrive quickly without frills. I suggest sellers be proactive and reach out to Usps to investigate packages that are late so the buyer can at least see updated tracking…use ups or FedEx if possible their delays haven’t been as bad. Also reaching out to a customer about a delay before the item is due to be delivered is also helpful so they don’t feel like they’re in the dark,In the same boat. This order, however, was received on 12/21, shipped by FC mail the beginning of Dec.,“We have granted an A-to-z Guarantee claim of $32.26 on order 113-4378715-*****. We have debited the amount from your account and have counted the claim against your Order Defect Rate.”,This is the only AZ claim we’ve received. The buyer was fully refunded, has the item and a hit to our order defect rate, which was spotless.,we have had over 58 packages lost from the week of 12/7. USPS is covering many of the priority packages we have filed claims on directly with USPS. Must be filed 15 days after postage was purchased and before 60 days. We have uploaded screenshots of the Amazon order showing we had to refund customer. Uploads where the refund to customer is not showing they have been denying. Several larger packages miraculously became “delivered” within 2 days of claims being filed.,
Amazon is NOT covering lost packages on A to Z claims if tracking just stops even if buy shipping was used. They are only covering delivered packages that the customer claims they did not get.,
As always, thanks Amazon.,I’ve appealed. I used Stamps. I wish I had seen your post before I appealed. I doubt I’ll see any of my money refunded, or the defect rate changed. Has anyone had success with claims against USPS? Thank you,You are just damn lucky that you have an access to the USPS clerk, where I live (Brooklyn) there is only 1 USPS worker, the angry line outside the door of the office and the only option is to drop prepaid packages to the big mail hampers hoping that all pieces of the mail will be scanned.,
As a result 1 package was never scanned, lost or stolen, A to z claim was opened and in 1 min granted, ODR took a hit, 4 other packages have been scanned and 3 weeks later still are traveling in the cyber space, we had to refund around $300 to avoid new A to z claims.,
Amazon does not care that the packages got lost or stuck somewhere, it is so easy to delight customers at the expense of the seller, really easy and enjoyable and also to add ODR penalties to the injury.,We are exactly in the same situation. I have like 60 orders from Dec 7, 8, 9 still showing in transit. I have issued around 3 refunds so far ($50 each) and one client opens an AZ claim ($50). To make things worse, I opened claims on US Mail since all of my shipments include insurance. Well to my surprise, Us mail denied all of my claims since they only honor lost orders no the ones showing in transit even though 3 weeks have passed since we ship them. So how sellers can survive in this type of environment where only the sellers are to be blamed? It is understandable Covid 19 is affecting the post office, it is also affecting amazon staff and it’s operation but why the sellers are the only ones paying the consequences. I hope that Amazon can provide some kind of protection to sellers specially to those who have shown good ratings for the past years.  I will ask Amazon tomorrow if they can pause account suppression and remove any negative ratings on sellers while the post office gets back on their feet and deliver on time as they used to.,only 20? you’re lucky. but no Amazon should have been a bit easier on us since USPS screwed the pooch royally AND increased their prices by 40 cents a package.,The only appeal is if it says delivered. Then you are covered. I even had to appeal those.,Jersey City NJ is the  worst. Any of our packages going through there always get delayed … especially media mail…  scanned in scanned out  push back into overflow continuously until we inquire about it.,I was told that again today by USPS.  I was told if a claim is filed then the item delivered, to provide them with all the information.,I agree it’s pretty bad. I have two packages there also going over 3 weeks now.,The problem with Jersey City is Kearney , Teterboro and Newark was closed . All their packages were going to Jersey City .,I have had so many packages lost this season I cant keep track. I have refunded every customer as it is not their fault USPS is TERRIBLE!!! I honestly think we are over 30 lost orders so far in the last 2 months. Tracking shows them all as dead or lost… IS there anything that can be done? All first class packages… Just ridiculous…,Same here the weekend of Thanskgiving thru the 7th is the issue.,All shipping companies are affected not just the USPS.   UPS and FEDEX are in bad shape as well.,From LI here as well. USPS is absolutely awful. I’ve had 3-4 claims decided against me even though I’ve purchased labels through Amazon and tracking shows it is in the USPS facility. Amazon doesn’t care at all. Very frustrating,Here’s a good one from Amazon (today).,Just denied the appeal of an A to Z claim because CS says I did NOT provide sufficient evidence that the package was delivered.  The Post Office Tracking shows DELIVERED but for CS that is not good enough.  So what do they want - a sworn affidavit from the letter carrier?,Why was my appeal denied?,
We have reviewed all available information and determined you have not provided sufficient evidence to prove delivery.,Did these morons ever think to simply look at the tracking record?  A trained monkey could do that.,What in blazes is wrong with Amazon and getting worse as the days go by?,unfortunately, you picked usps as the carrier, so Amazon will penalize you for late delivery. Getting labels via Amazon just means you wanted their discounted shipping. In the end, you made a commitment to an Amazon customer to ship and deliver on-time. With FBA, Amazon holds themselves accountable when orders deliver late. But you’re the fulfiller, so you picked USPS - so the buck ends with you.  We keep thinking we’re customers of Amazon’s as sellers and the sooner we realize we’re in a David & Golaith partnership with Amazon to serve Amazon customers the better. Folks don’t separate issues with USPS from Amazon - so Amazon is going to penalize partners (Seller Fullfilled) when we pick shippers who miss the mark.,Same issue here. I changed over to buying shipping from Amazon after a case last month where I copied over the wrong tracking data.,Book shipped on time. Scanned twice in California and then again in Philadelphia on 12/10, and after that NOTHING. I had no idea there were issues with the Philadelphia hub.,Buyer correctly wants a refund, but Amazon should cover this one.,They auto-granted, I appealed, they denied the appeal.,I’ve been trying to find a phone number, and NO LUCK.,USPS Delivery Confirmation with Media Mail is not a tracking service–meaning the package is scanned enroute. Usually, it is, but there is no guarantee. I’ve even had a Postal Clerk tell me that she was not supposed to scan the code at the window for online postage purchases. Something about that’s why they offer the discount.,I will keep appealing, even if it is futile.,Yessireebob - and our friend , ain’t the only one of us plying that same oar in our Seller Community:"
A-Z Claim granted against me but it's not my fault -Damn Postal Service,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","Same issue I sold a book, the shipping was very delayed on customs, so the buyer asked for a refund, I send the email explaining the situation and to be patient, he got the refund and my account is at risk, you can check on the shipping tracking the book is now out of customs and going into the USA, it took too much due to the pandemic and I now need help for getting the money back for selling it as soon as it reaches the buyer, I am afraid he will not repay nor will ship the book back, I don’t want to lose money on this I am no big company I am a mother trying to sell things to pay for kids school in this very bad situation we are all living.  It was not my fault, I had to pay extra for international shipping than the provided from Amazon.,Amazon either needs to work with us Sellers this holiday season on these A-to-Z claims though.,It is insane and understandable, customers did not receive the package.  But we are in a Pandemic, vaccines are being distributed and there is a labor shortage.,Now, i’m just assuming, how does Amazon know if the buyers/customers are not putting a “hold” in their mail, for the purpose to delay the process?  This is rather concerning, because we can’t even know which customers are ethical and which are not and our hope is that all buyers/customers to have a higher level of integrity.,I met the same problem and loss $400 .,
Appeal no use.,How to report?,
Thanks.,If anyone could help me it would be great. So same thing is happening to me with one buyer, I got a A-Z claim for item not received when it is still in transit. I also bought the shipping from Amazon. They approved the claim and deducted the money from my account. I tried to appeal it and am still waiting. She will end up getting this item. So if she gets it and it shows delivered, do I get my money back or does she return it or am I just screwed out that money and the item?,Also, because I am a new seller, this is the only issue I have had and I am now getting warnings that my account could be deactivated:,
Your account is at risk of deactivation,What the heck do I do now?!!??,Depends which policy you’re looking at and what Amazon decides to enforce. It’s posted in several posts earlier where it exactly states in the A-Z claim policy item must be received by the latest estimated delivery date or the A-Z funding comes from seller account. Buy shipping policy states one thing and A-Z policy contradicts that. That’s why many sellers are losing claims and appeals even with buy shipping and shipped on time,I just had one of these A-to-Z claims against my account. The buyer did not receive the book by Christmas because the USPS workers at the Memphis and Jersey City distribution facilities did not sort the book so it could be delivered to Philadelphia. I have sympathy for USPS workers; they have put themselves at risk of getting COVID-19 throughout 2020 with their bosses having very little care for their wellbeing. Even so, some of these delays this year have been intolerable.,Who I am really angry at right now is Amazon. I did not get a chance to respond to the A-to-Z claim before it was granted. I went to lunch today with no A-to-Z claims on my account (I had not had one filed against me in 3 years) and came back to see that Amazon had granted the claim, refunded the customer his money, and placed an alert that my account is at risk of deactivation because my Order Defect Rate is now over 1% (since a very slow Christmas selling season on Amazon has meant that I have less than 100 sales in the past 60 days, though thankfully there are other sites where I have gotten many more sales this Christmas).,This is just one more example of Amazon being capricious, incompetent, and malicious. From the mess that is their catalog to their ridiculous price alerts and now to A-to-Z claims like this, Amazon has made their contribution to 2020 being such a wonderful year.,Please tell me you got them scanned and have the receipt.,I opened case.,

This case has been marked as ‘Answered’ and cannot be responded to.,We finally put our store on “vacation” setting. Nothing is going out until the USPS can catch up or Amazon is willing to work out something with us as sellers. You may want to argue that we’re losing money, but we had 92% of our Nov/Dec shipments granted the A2Z refund before we shut down. Yes, we are appealing along with everyone else, but nothing reversed as of 2 weeks later. Hope you have better luck!,My troubles also revolve around Dec 7th - but in Wisconsin centers.,The answer may be “yes” but it’s inhuman.,We are in NW Arkansas.  A local USPS empoyee told us that many offices (especially in the NE) have actually closed sorting facilities for various reasons and lengths of time, thus holding mail there until they get employees back in the location(s).  Example:  one employee tests positive for COVID-19 and all employees are sent home for 14 days (WITH pay, I might add).,We are aware that order fulfilment may be impacted by carrier related disruptions and have posted reminders for customers to keep this in mind before filing for refunds. If you are impacted by these disruptions, please update your new estimated delivery dates in a timely manner to keep customers informed.

We are outside of Philadelphia also.  These trailers won’t move until at least February.,How do you update your delivery times?  Not going to extend the handling time. I cannot find where to adjust delivery times.,We shouldn’t have to change shipping dates. The last time i did that Amazon threatened to close my account. Now customers are changing addresses to forward to another and when they don’t get it they file a claim and of course Amazon pays them.,That is against the law. They have to scan every package because of USPS insurance for the package.,And how come amazon doesn’t notify customers of these USPS delays? Other marketplaces and retail websites post on their website that there could be delays due to the virus.  Amazon should post reminders to customers.,Hi Susan,,While it’s great to hear a response from someone on the Amazon Team. This doesn’t address the countless issues that have occurred this Holiday Season. A-Z claims have been granted and counted against us sellers even if everything was followed properly. Tracking can show the item was delivered and Amazon still gave the buyer a refund and made us pay it. An appeal was also denied. What are we to do in these cases where Amazon allows the buyer both a refund and keep the item? We’re out the item and money now because whoever was reviewing the case doesn’t follow (or perhaps even understand) Amazon policies.,I’d also like to mention that Amazon is one of the few places where I haven’t seen any sort of mention of delays occurring in Transit. eBay for example makes sure the buyer is notified of any issues that could occurring. The USPS website also has a large red banner about the delays. Why isn’t Amazon informing customers about this properly and is instead actually advising customers to ask for a refund?"
A-Z Claim granted against me but it's not my fault -Damn Postal Service,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","We ship out of Ramsey NJ. NY and NJ have been so backed up throughout this year that the USPS was trucking packages out of state for sorting (per our USPS BSN rep).,Ohio and Michigan are far worse. There were news stories about 200 plus trucks backed up unable to unload at sort facilities.,Not really.    The Buy Shipping program is optional, the rules for A-Z are not.    You buy “protection” from the A-Z consequences for shipping issues.,Funny we had also had quite a few shipments from Dec 5th to 7th that were never scanned and delivered weeks later (late) with bottlenecks in the NJ area.  One parcel was stuck in Missouri for 10 days.  We’ve had no A to Zs yet …and expect that we might given the sales volume this holiday season-- but we’re getting quite a few return request for late delivery- if the parcel was not delivered by the last date that Amazon promised then we’re eating the loss. If delivered on or before the latest date then we are treating as no longer needed and customer is responsible for all shipping fees to and from.,Glad to see that for some, that Amazon us reversing the funds initially lost due to an A to Z.,What a crazy trying year in general - especially with USPS this past month and Amazon the entire year.,If you used Amazon shipping, appeal it and you’ll be fine.  That is how they deal with these situations.  If you don’t use Amazon shipping, it can be a problem.  Not fair, but…,I am so sorry to hear this. My business is going through the same stuff. All I can say is stop using USPS and use a different shipping method. As of date I have made 38 claims and complaints with USPS. They write back with the same nonsense about covid… blablabla. Start doing charge-backs on your shipping labels that haven’t been scanned in. It really ticks me off how usps can up the costs of shipping yet their shipping methods have become more and more unreliable.,Has anyone tried contact Amazon by phone?,
I have had 4 A-Z Claims are granted and paid for by Amazon thank god.,
However, I have (1) customer whos tracking like so many others has not updated since label was created. USPS website says my packages has been scanned into the distribution center however when you go into the Manage orders section on Amazon it does not state anything but “Package Has Shipped”.,I contacted Amazon today by phone and asked them how to proceed and he said that if the A-Z claim is filed and I do not win to contact Amazon directly once again and they will revert it. To confirm this, i got his name and customer ID so that if there is a problem I can dispute it and provide his information.,Hopes this helps.,If your first appeal gets denied and you can show you shipped on time with a valid tracking number scanned by USPS (not just a “pre-shipment” label printing), you can contact seller support and have them escalate your original A to Z claim.,I’ve had about 8 so far this season and only had to appeal one of them.  When we did escalate it they reversed the original decision.,DEFINITELY copy and paste Amazon’s “Buy Shipping” guarantee in the response as well as list the tracking number, date scanned into the USPS system, etc.,So far, we’ve had zero A to Z claims affect our defect rate, and all have ended up getting reimbursed.,Things will get better on 1/21/20.,We have had over 30 to date.,
We are in one zip code.  Shows scanned same or next day in another zip code then the package seems to go missing for several days.  We get the cut and paste "" you did not ship on time"" AND “package not delivered to buyer on time”.,
In understanding the age of those reviewing these claims and their limited ability to understand the written english word, it’s understandable that they are choosing the most popular reason to deny claims and using that.,
We are waiting til the storm blows over then contacting the jeff team with all of these claims.,
We are in Pennsylvaniai outside of PHiladelphia which seems to be a “hot spot” - literally dozens of trailers full of packages picked up in November still waiting to be scanned and moved along.,
Today our postal carrier came by to ask us why we are turning the trailer away when they come for daily pick up (he - the carrier- does not do our pick up and now we have switched almost completely to UPS, the balance are being taken to a local Post office window to be individually scanned) told us we need to learn to have patience, that many things are late and not delivered.  He told me he thinks customers are being too demanding understanding what USPS has gone through…  and he doesn’t understand why they should get their money back.   Took me a moment to be able to look at him and nicely wish him a good day…,I’m trying your verbiage.  Tried the other longer verbiage and 2 A-Z’s were denied.

Amazon provided us a guarantee that they will take care of the claims if we buy shipping from them.  Now they are not holding their part of the bargain.  Just design a system to go after every case, if most of us to this, there will be thousands or tens of thousands complaints and we will get righted.  If most give up - well, then we lose - the choice is ours.,+1, This is a disaster, I’m fighting over a dozen of these. Some are handles right the first time, some are won on appeal, some are lost with no explanation as to why, and some appeals are just closed with no explanation.

I got against my Order Defect Rate for several this months.,Nail, meet nuke.,No use to appeal.,I shipped a package from Richmond, TX on Dec. 2nd and it’s been sitting in Coppell, TX since Dec. 7th!

A month later he emails that it’s not what was described and I emailed him back showing exactly wat listing said and exactly what I sent him. Still, 1 week later amazon processes a full refund to him, I email amazon and get nothing in response. So, now I’m not only out my money, I apparently not even getting my product back either… Amazon sucks, never used to, they don’t even give you a chance to prove customer giving fraudulent claims, plus they now say my store is at risk of being closed.

Be prepared for a shocker.,I talked to my mail lady about the same thing-had a package I sent priority on the 8th and it is out for delivery today, finally 22 days later.  At least she does scan all of my items but she said they told her that because of the volume she only has to scan 5 items from the same person.  Which is a bad deal, I’ve had packages that have NO updates in shipping until it has been delivered.  Amazon should not give claims for over a month because of this reason but they don’t care what I think either.,Try to send an email directly to Jeff,This has been happening for a bit of time now.,

They said they are 30 days behind…,This is the policy as it relates to standard orders. The policies do not contradict but rather one is there to protect you from the other if you are eligible.,Think about it like a fast pass at an amusement park, the policy is you have to wait in line but if you have a fast pass you don’t.,That is the a-to-z policy but then the buy shipping policy overrides it and protects you from what that policy states if you follow and meet all requirements.,This is why in some cases a buyer using Buy shipping has to appeal an A-to-Z claim.,Yes and yes.

This includes 2 high value orders of $1000 and $1600…,I only ship 15-40 packages a day and since Thanksgiving we have been sitting in line to get acceptance scans ( normally we just dump them in a collection bin ),Also stupid question - Is there a way in Amazon to see all the tracking #'s purchased for a specific time frame ?  On the big E its very easy and simple to see what is running late.,What a nightmare for 3P sellers …so stressful,we are not even receiveing notification about A-Z claims before they are granted…just an email saying an A-Z was granted by Amazon and the money debited from our account…three this morning alone all still showing in transit and all shipped and scanned within required time by USPS…now I currently have FOUR appeals pending investigations ALL shows still in USPS transit and all were shipped week of 12/8…so frustrating!!!  2 are actually are IN the same town as the customer per USPS!,For high value items, you might be better off using UPS Priority.

The next day the buyer’s order was delivered.  Are we allowed to ask to have the item returned?,I thought so also.,I had never seen the page with the language someone posted above regarding on time delivery.,I am of the opinion that amazon is enforcing that part of the policy dependent upon shipping speeds or cost paid for shipping and also most likely an algorithm.,I hardly ever get claims. So if I get one per 10,000 orders it would make sense that they would pay that without hesitation. Also, none of the orders I had claims on had shipping charges.,I could see where the case could be made that if you promised a certain shipping speed (example overnight) and had to charge a high cost for that- and if you were not able to deliver- I could easily see where that would qualify as a sale that should be refunded by the seller if they already had not worked out the shipping refund to the buyer in communications.,I got one too and I realized that USPS did not scan it because I dropped it off Friday the 4th. The day it was due out. HOWEVER, it got scanned the 5th. So, my fault. =(…now I am trying to get things out a day before. I know that is hard but it will help with further claims, but lets hope I do not get anymore,I have to say some customer are real jerks. While MOST are amazing and understanding. There is always one or two that are horrid.,Just appealed the first one that has gone against us.  Although I think I did a good job, I wish I had seen that format in the link.  Good to have going forward.   Of the 5 that have been filed, this was the first one they debited from us.  Very odd.,Can you provide the tracking number? If it has the correct acceptance scan not the scan sheet scan then you should appeal with the executive team. We had to do this on two claims to get the correct outcome.,It is not the “Damn Postal Service”, but the Damn Postmaster General."
A-Z Claim granted against me but it's not my fault -Damn Postal Service,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","December 7 must have been a glitchy day for USPS. Same story, across the nation.,I have been fortunate. So far, I have only had 8 of these, one has been delivered, the rest are still tracking, BUT, are moving… Interesting thing, all of these issues are from orders shipped on the 7th. Anyone else seeing this?,This is regarding when a customer ‘can’ file an A-to-Z it is not about the Amazon Buy Shipping policy.,Buy shipping requires it to have been shipped on time with the real ‘accepted’ scan (not the scan sheet) scan by or before your ship by date.,"" , If you purchase Amazon’s Buy Shipping and ship on time, you are protected against claims where a customer reports problems with delivery. Amazon will cover the cost of these claims and they will not affect your Order Defect Rate."",The problem is most people are seeing the real accepted scan a few days (or longer)(or never) after the package is picked up or dropped off which eliminates the buy shipping protection because in Amazon’s eyes it was shipped late.,Yes. Appeal them all and let them know that you purchased the labels through Amazon and the delay in shipment or lost orders are not your fault.  Its about a 50/50 chance of winning but I have won most of my appeals.,Good luck,This snafu of Post Office delivery is due to the election and Trump’s lack of funding the US Post Office. If you search the News for mail delays there are packages piled up all over the US. I believe this was intentional to block mail in ballots. Now all my packages dating back for months have no tracking feature from the USPS. Everyone has given me a refund. I had a next day delivery December 10 and the package arrived December 29. The seller gave me a refund but I never expected to receive the item. And the vendor told me if I received the item to use it or donate it to charity or throw it away.,Also use a post office scan code - it forces the post office to scan everything in you drop off at once. (orders, order forms - select scan code - end of day code)  The post office will also love you for giving them one.  FYI - I found out through 100’s of howler emails that the post office is actually not scanning in some cases to save time and get orders on the road.  They are not lost, mostly moving but they can’t see them which is completely frustrating for both sides.,Thank you, I came to the forums for this same issue and will be using your response,sent a package in my own city, took over 2 weeks for delivery!!!,

When the return arrived post master was holding as I owed postage, 1st sign my items are less than 4 ounces since I knew it was items I sell I refused so it would get back to buyer so that it could be returned properly.  So its my fault! because I refused the item and they refunded the customer. You just can’t make this stuff up.,I feel your pain. I have on average 15 - 20 per day running at least 3 weeks behind.  For every 3-4 of those that get delivered each day, I get 1-2 more new complaints for people just wanting a refund and a free item.,Yes but this does not take into consideration the Buy Shipping Policy.,Did you check if the package had an acceptance scan on or before your Amazon ship by date?,
Did you use Amazon Buy Shipping?,Yes,We tell customer give us another 48-72 hours to see if we can locate from our side.,If customer states INR but tracking says otherwise, go to originating P.O., ask counter-supervisor to check the in-house side of the GPS, not the public’s view.

Customers located parcel-- pre-scanned and still on the shelves!!,New York went into Abyss on Dec 14th and Buyers do not care. Which I kind of get the issue here maps like this.  Sacks were picked by the post office on Dec 14th, and were not scanned until Dec 28 in Little Rock AR, how about that.

Why are we all losing these A-Z’s???,Slide 3 of 6 states the following,Buy Shipping can help you safeguard your performance metrics and Order Defect Rate,
• If you ship an order on time using Buy Shipping, and the Buyer leaves seller feedback entirely related to delayed,
packages, you can request to have the impact of Seller feedback removed from your metrics.,
• If you ship an order on time, but the package isn’t delivered by the carrier, you won’t be held responsible for,
covering costs of the associated A-to-z claim.,In the beginning of the delivery mess, one morning my packages were all scanned delivered instead of accepted.  Does anyone know how to find out if they are actually delivered? I had very honest buyers tell me when, but the drop shippers hopped on each one for an instant refund.,2 Priority sent Oct 7th filed claim Oct 21st. Received denial from Postoffice Dec 17th stating claim denied package was delivered Nov 17th  within their acceptable  guidelines,I feel like an idiot at times with all the risk involved, no help for us at all.   Some people are unforgiving and don’t care to return a package even if it’s 1 day late.,Same here, my mail carrier didn’t scan in a bunch of my packages on time. We have a storefront and they pick up from if it’s a lot going out sometimes they scan when they get back to the office looks like one didn’t unload the truck till the next day…I am really sad Amazon is not consistent and is punishing sellers over the USPS issues,Same and I think this is a mess when Amazon Claims to care about small business it should doesn’t mean the ones using it’s platform.,Have any of you noticed that AMAZON gives customers DELIVERY DATES THAT ARE INCORRECT?

USPS in possession of item,LOS ANGELES, CA 90044,Almost 90% of our orders in the last 3-4 Weeks have been LATE! (Can you imagine how Media Mail is being handled???). We ALL (including AMAZON) know NOT MUCH OF ANYTHING IS BEING DELIVERED THAT QUICK!!! Even the POST OFFICE has this posted on their web site:,
“Alert: USPS is experiencing unprecedented volume increases and limited employee availability due to the impacts of COVID-19. We appreciate your patience and remain committed to delivering the holidays to you.”.,Even ‘You Know Who’ has something posted on their web site saying “High shipping volumes are causing some delays. Please allow extra time”.,We been lucky/blessed to have customers with some understanding. Here’s the twist here AMAZON will give us a ‘ding’ saying that the package(s) was DELIVERED LATE…Why??? We have oversea orders that DO NOT have Tracking Numbers (Because there are NO TRACKING NUMBERS FOR OVERSEAS)…Amazon gives us a ‘ding’ saying that a percentage of our orders did not have valid tracking number…Why would AMAZON count TRACKING for oversea orders??? AMAZON REALLY NEEDS TO GET A REALTY CHECK or Is this a way to kick Sellers to the curb? HOW MANY SELLERS ARE GOING TO BE PUNISHED FOR SOMETHING WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER? LATE DELIVERIES HAS BEEN ON EVERY MAJOR NEWS SHOW, THE INTERNET & NEWSPAPERS!,Thanks. I am aware of what the buy shipping policy is. That is contradicted in the A-Z claims policy that states seller account will be charged if not delivered within estimated delivery time. Many claims are being denied now when using buy shipping and shipping on time. It’s not consistent at all,DEC 7 was the Pearl Harbor of USPS,I usually work an hour each day I am off just to check and respond to messages. Even on Christmas.,I am aware of the buy shipping policy which is contradicted by the A-Z claims policy so it is very relevant. As seen by other posters many claims are being denied when buy shipping was used and items were shipped on time.,I am in Allentown  and the philly hub had over 8,000 packages of mine in their possession with no tracking or movement. We ship 200-400 packages a day and completely destroyed us.  i found out that shut the hub down for almost a week for a covid cleaning, and told nobody.  i only found out because i know someone who worked there who got covid.,this nightmare started art on Nov 27 and is still going on . I ended up having to go to vacation mode to stop the bleeding. ended up loosing another 26k in potential revenue and have already refunded over 10k in claims.,I think the A-Z policy you pasted may be original policy that applies to orders that are not shipped with Amazon Buy Shipping.  The difference being what shipping is used.  The language definitely could be clearer and it does sow confusion.,You are right about this! I thought it was bad bot programming, but I had 2 ‘identical in the details’ claims a week apart. One auto-approved, the next auto-denied. The denial was reversed on appeal, but when the claim checks all the boxes for eligibility an appeal should not be necessary.,Appealing has done nothing lately, now you have to call in and appeal again to the post dispute department.  Some people have stated that works, I’m still waiting for an answer.,It’s getting hard to keep track of all these claims that should have been covered under buy shipping (not even the ones that didn’t get scanned properly, the ones that clearly showed they carrier was in possession of the product) they are denying against policy.,We had a few of those.  I sent appeal with simply stating facts that shipping bought through Amazon with valid tracking of the date shipped.  I included the tracking numbers.  I requested they remove the negative impact from our account.  I received a response the next day that the funds were placed back in our account and our Order Defect Rate would be corrected within 24 hours which it was.,Hope this helps,Totally agree. Thankfully I haven’t had any cases yet. My buyers have been understanding and now all my delayed sales have been delivered. Not sure what the difference in policy is but that’s what is currently posted. Whether it was for non buy shipping or not Amazon may be using that to justify denying some claims. Definitely should be clarified and consistent though. Many posters in the forums are having their appeals denied even when meeting buy shipping criteria,facts,Good luck, I’m in the Hershey area and everything I’ve had rerouted to Philly has been lost or is about 3 weeks behind."
A-Z Claim granted against me but it's not my fault -Damn Postal Service,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","Then you’re good. Only if they need anything from you or if buyer messaged you through buyer seller messaging would you have to respond. That would be return requests. If you missed those messages Amazon would just refund the money for returns you didn’t authorize,Forum_Friend,those go against your ODR.,That is not the buy shipping protection cited.   Buying shipping through Amazon offers protection.,The OP mentioned they bought shipping on Amazon.   Several others asked this as well.  Sorry but your link is not relevant to the discussion about Buy Shipping coverage.,Correct.,For Mike64220, here is the language:, If you purchase Amazon’s Buy Shipping and ship on time, you are protected against claims where a customer reports problems with delivery. Amazon will cover the cost of these claims and they will not affect your Order Defect Rate.,None of the claims amazon has paid have gone against my odr, and they still have not been delivered yet either,I have the same problem. But I lost my appeal. I don’t know where to make an appeal now. Because the A-Z claim channel has been closed. Who can tell me what I should do?, ""Practically all shipments mailed on Dec 7th and 8th still have 0 scans. "",Ditto from Long Island NY,Amazon’s a-z verbage contradicts the buy shipping verbage. Another example of poorly written policies.,The Md/NY/NJ postal hubs seem to be the worst. Like others, I have quite a few packages mailed around the 10th that went to NY to die.,Some of our food products leave us from our tennessee warehouse idk where you are up there but it seems like Chattanooga is a black hole. Stuff will literally not show any movement a few since dec 4th 1 since the 12th. We refunded a customer on Monday whose order hadn’t moved since one scan on the 12th then boom its in memphis today…the customer on their 1st email advised us not to use the pandemic as an excuse as it was over. Maybe I have been working too hard and missed the end?,Same here, from Baltimore.  December 7th.  Printed postage, placed on loading dock, and still nothing more than :“label printed” showing in system for all packages from that date.   Problems elsewhere, too, but that date is the worst,You can’t blame the big monopoly for trying to keep all their billions.  Amazon is flouting their own published policies to KEEP IT ALL!,You need to speak to a customer service rep. email messages will be futile. They are funding my A-Z claims except for 1 where the customer service rep told me I had to refund the customer and when I did they would not refund me because I issued the refund and not them. Really dumb. I’m still fighting that one. December 7/8 is the shipping dates where I have the most orders that have not been delivered.,This is the new way Amazon is screwing 3P sellers.  Amazon knows from the tracking number that you used Amazon Shipping (or did not).  If you used Amazon shipping you are supposed to be “covered” for INR claims.,But Amazon is granting immediate rapid fire refunds to any Amazon ""customer’ who files an A to Z claim (even if the tracking shows it was delivered) and dinging your ODR.  Amazon does NOT ask for your input (because someone in another country may have to actually do the right thing and protect you the 3P seller).  Since you cannot reply the claim is automatically granted and immediately paid (unlike refunds we process which take at least 24 hours).  And remember - Amazon takes a fee for processing the refund so you are losing even more money (and I do not believe Amazon refunds their fees they take on the sale either - bookkeeping provided to us is murky).,Now you can appeal - using the template another poster provided is excellent.  We keep it a little simpler - Dear Amazon - Please reverse this A to Z Claim for the following: 1 - we used Amazon Shipping Tracking # 9300 xxxxxxx etc.  2 - USPS show the package enroute with a delay in delivery (or) USPS has marked the tracking record as legally delivered.  3 - Since we used Amazon Shipping we are supposed to be covered for all INR claims such as this one.  Please provide us the protection Amazon agreed to provide by us using Amazon Shipping.  Thank you.,Now this changed the status of the claim from “Seller Funded” to “Under Review”.  How long that takes is anyone’s guess.  We have one claim “under review” for almost 1-week (item was shown as delivered and immediately after the time marked by the Post Office the scammer (I mean buyer) filed the A to Z claim.  The other claim appeal is 1-day old for now.,But the money on both has still been taken from us.  So 3P sellers continue to work at a loss because Amazon has Too Much Control Over Our Money.,Keep an eye on the tracking and when it is delivered to the buyer and if they do not send it back, report them for mail fraud.,no point in appealing…no one ever reads it…i got one where i sent a dvd to a customer in norway…it came back undeliverable, asked him to confirm the correct address…sent it out again…its sitting in a norway post office probably once again undeliverable as the address is wrong…i had tracking…showed it was sitting in norways post office since november 27th…but thats my fault,I’m also in that region and we have had the same issues all month.  We’ve had shipments going to Utah via Puerto Rico, going to Pittsburgh via Washington state, North Carolina via Florida, the list can go on!  But to top the cake, we have all 85 packages that we shipped on 12/16 still show 0 scans.  We don’t drop off our packages either.  They have their commercial account van pick up here daily so there’s no way to ensure that they scan them at the time of mailing.  I can’t get a hold of anyone at the Chester regional office or the Philly DC.  I recently had one of our local delivery vehicles drive by the Philly DC on the way to a customer and they took pictures to show me that they have people out sorting out of trailers in the streets with mail laying in the middle of the street!  What a cluster…,Yep…we’re right there with all.  Several of our packages are still sitting at the USPS Philadelphia Distribution Site.  We had one package just going from PA to NJ–it is now in West Palm Beach Florida.  We were told the Phila distribution site is so congested, they are simply throwing packages into any bin to ship “anywhere” just to clean out–so by shipping our package to Florida, it becomes Florida’s problem, not there’s.  We have several packages out of Philadelphia that are taking “the scenic route” to their ultimate destination.  It’s a terrible problem–frankly, we’ve never had such problems as this year and we’ve been selling in this region for about 15 years.  Next year–we are going to avoid Priority Mail and go UPS / FedEx, but for first class, well, we’re stuck.,Amazon is NOT standing by their guarantee policy! I have had 4 cases denied even though I shipped on time and purchased shipping through Amazon. I appealed but lost with no explanation as of why. THIS IS WRONG!,Same here - appealed but lost.

How can they still be 3 weeks behind!,Philadelphia Distribution center sucks on a good day and it’s an absolute waste of space at this time.,Problem is that in the policy for A-Z it states that item has to be delivered on by the latest estimated delivery date to be covered.

Like I said, I am a newbie.  Also, correction, he was asking for $2000 dollars and not $5000 like I initially said (sorry) but still it’s a lot of money and costs way more than what I paid for those items.,What does this mean?  I can no longer get the items that I paid for with my hard-earned money and BELONG TO ME?  I have no intention of selling anymore.  They can close my FBA account for all I care.

Compliance Request -- Amazon's latest complication to banish 3rd party sellers or?,Selling on Amazon,"How many of you also received this email with subject - Action Required: Compliance requirements for your product listings?,They had targeted stamp sets I was selling!   After “appealing,” I received this message:,Greetings,,We are contacting you as you indicated the product you wish to list should not be subject to the compliance documents. We have reviewed your request and have concluded that your product is a toy and subject to the compliance requirements. In order to list the toy on Amazon you must submit the documents requested. This toy may be removed if the compliance documents are not received.,Why is this happening?,The documents we are requesting helps ensure products are compliant with local laws and safe for customers.,Really?  “Safe for customers”?  NOT!   Another reason I will likely be pulling my products and selling elsewhere.  Anyone have another interpretation for this?,If they are a toy, they must comply with CPSC requirements.,Just Amazon covering their butt.,If your stamp sets were from a reputable brand and you were part of their distribution chain it will only be a minor effort to comply.,I have no clue whether you are panicking prematurely or buying crud from China which does not meet regulatory requirements. Some Chinese products come from reputable manufacturers and are designed for export and meet CPSC standards.,Thanks for trying to help.  As with SS, you are making assumptions, though, instead of asking clarifying questions.  Perhaps you are loyal to the “great” support available here.,You ask a question and then insult the person who answers you.  You will be lucky to get any more answers.,“Insult” is a big claim there and that was not necessarily my intent.  Look at the response.   Responders like Lake often insult instead of offering help.  Seems to stroke their ego.,Lake is a highly respected seller and forum veteran. You should strive to have half of his knowledge of the platform."
New items with price stickers,Selling on Amazon,"I looked for a thread on this topic.  Do most sellers sell a new item as new if it has a price sticker on the plastic?  I sell mostly video games and I am on the fence whether this is normal.  I usually sell them as “Like New” to avoid a headache.  I can remove a lot of my stickers with “goo gone”, but that can cause the plastic to stretch slightly and smell (pleasantly strange),It all depends on the surface to which the sticker is applied.  In our retail stores we use a heat gun or Goof Off depending on the surface and the type of sticker applied.  Cardstock, cardboard, cello wrapping, and plasticized surfaces all react differently.    ,You definitely cannot sell them as new. Well, I am assuming you are not getting them from an authorized distributor with stickers on them.,Thanks JwsMarket, I usually don’t sell them as new.  It hasn’t hurt my selling much.  I was just curious about if sellers sold new items with price stickers on them.  Most of my stickers are from Best Buy and no, I’m not buying from an authorized distributor.,Thanks SELLC, that’s some good advice, I’ll look into it.  A heat gun?  Sounds like it may be worth my while but I only have a dozen or so new items with stickers.,You can sometimes freeze them too. throw it in the freezer for 20 mins or so and see if it peels off easier. a heat gun can melt the plastic sometimes. You might be better off with trying a hair dryer first but beware if they are shrink wrapped  heat can affect the shrink wrap.  I would try the freezer method first. Can also throw them in a giant ziplock bag if worried about something from freezer getting on them.,Thanks Shadowwar, freezing an item briefly may cause condensation on the disc.  I am going to stick with “Goo Gone” probably.  Video game collectors are a picky lot.  They often want a perfect seal, and it seems as though sticking a game in the freezer won’t effect the plastic so it’s a great a idea.  Sounds like it has worked for you in the past.,No, this is prohibited by some obscure Amazon policy, which states; no product on Amazon may display the price on the packaging (or something like that).,I’m in a good mood so I am not going to search Amazon looking for it, just to cut & paste it and cite the link. Somebody else can do that today.,New means it is a sealed game and hasn’t been opened.  You don’t need a sticker price on it, it just has to be unopened.,
Try & find a stock picture of the video game.  I do that all the time.  Use the stock picture, without the sticker.,Surely you aren’t advocating copyright infringement?,Because that is sort of illegal and some people frown on that. Including Amazon, they have a whole section about copyright stuff and not to do that.,bburniske2,Try rubbing alcohol… if it’s particularly stuff, you can cut a small piece of a white cotton t-shirt, lay it on top of the sticker, too soak through the sticker, and then many times it just rubs off…,You just want to make sure that what the rubbing alcohol is not going to soak through whatever the stickers applied to…,On Amazon I primarily sell books-- everything else gets sold elsewhere, just a minefield…,I sometimes use a heat gun, the one I have is for stripping paint off of houses… but you really have to know your dust jacket makeup, to make sure it’s not going to Bubble any finishes, or soaked through – ruin the jacket…,Although they are excellent for taking off stickers off of boxes, which I use on other marketplaces, since nothing I sell on Amazon generally gets boxed… many things are one-offs, so it’s not like worth buying large amounts of specific box sizes…,Many times I use cubic shipping Solutions, and I do know how to cut down boxes… to maximize shipping cost which can be the difference sometimes in making you competitive…,Good luck,Ronsonol lighter fluid is better. Goo Gone leaves an oily residue. Lighter fluid leaves nothing.,The only time I have ever had a negative experience with lighter fluid was on the jewel case for a CD.  I won’t recommend that.,Rubbing alcohol as suggested above is not a good idea. Wrong base and much greater chance of collateral damage.,Thanks The_Sawle_Mill, it sounds like this is an official policy and I’ll adhere to it.,Thanks bookwormapril, I have some Zippo lighter fluid handy, is that the same?  Goo Gone surely makes a mess but works quick.,Thanks vespa, you’ve helped me before.  Seems as though you have a great business model and multiple platforms makes you diverse.  I mostly deal with high end collectors and have had a couple things sent back because the seal wasn’t perfect.  I’ve run into some pick book buyers too, so I’m not alone.,Don’t know. Ronsonol is manufactured by Zippo, but don’t know if they are the same. Ronsonol just states that it is a light petroleum distillate.,There’s an old chemistry adage: “like dissolves like”.  Meaning that lighter fluid works on the sticky part of labels so well because they are almost always the same base.,Used book sellers get lots of experience with this sort of thing.,bburniske2… there is a reason that a lot of the solvent type --things only come in metal cans, lacquer thinner is good too, but that would be a Last Resort… they might dissolve the dispenser vessel…,So if it has to come in a metal can it’s pretty caustic, especially to something that’s plastic…,You just don’t want to break down those clamshell cases, and have them fog, because of whatever you were using to remove the sticker…,I wipe off all of my dust jackets, with alcohol does a bang-up, fantastic job… it’s like washing walls – you only use white Rags - cloth, paper towels… older  OPP, plain paper, absolutely not it will degrade & remove color… ruining that vintage item…,Everybody has their favorites,  everyone’s mileage may vary… or maybe situational…,Alcohol also does a wonderful job on my 400 lb semi commercial stainless steel stove, + the stainless steel refrigerator front,  my three Bowl commercial sink, the microwave front… tile countertops , floors , bathroom fixtures , sinks  – most of the time I put it on the thing I’m using to wipe not spraying–since germs seem to be a factor these days…,You may have a hair dryer lying around that will work.

Can Somebody PLEASE Help Me?,Selling on Amazon,"I got my AmazonSeller account suspended because of slow USPS shipping during a pandemic AND the holidays LOL. I am broke and have no money and now Amazon is holding onto $400 of mine and every time I appeal I get the SAME message over and over again. I have gave them the longest, most detailed paragraphs possible and they still send me the same thing, why do they do this to me?

Either way it’s the same reply lol, they really just don’t care at all. They want to take the little money I have to my name. The original suspension letter just says my ODR was above 1%, which isn’t even true, we test all of our items once we receive them back.

The more experienced sellers on this forum, who have helped other suspended sellers get reinstated, generally want to see the contents of that notice.

Going through Seller Support or anyone at AMZ does no good.,I don’t know how to share a screenshot, but my ODR is 4.92%. 1.64% is from A-Z claims, which are just the slow shipping times when customers got mad during the holidays. I made sure to give them their packages for free anyways because I don’t even wanna dispute the A-Z claims. 3.28% is from negative feedback. I don’t know why it is so high though, I am doing my best and all of my packages are arriving. Sometimes I get a few returns on some TV Antennas because they work differently in all areas. Maybe this is why?,Okay, That isn’t good. You don’t need to always dispute an A-Z if you want to file a SAFE-T claim because you don’t want the metrics impact and you used Amazon’s Buy Shipping for example. But let’s drill down on the data to figure out what is happening with the very concerning 3.28% negative Feedback first. From Seller Central Mouse over , and select , from the resulting drop-down menu.,Start with the Negatives (which should be listed in chronological order), don’t be dismissive of any Buyer messages, make a list, chart whatever and try to categorize or generalize the reasons given over the last 90 days (and 180, and 30). Then do this with any neutral Feedback. ,Now go to your product reviews and filter for negative Reviews for the past 90, 30, and 180 days. Categorize or otherwise organize the negatives.,Then in Seller Central mouse over Performance again and select Account Health from the drop-down menu. Now take a close look in the Policy Compliance area and record each of the categories that are not zero. Click the link for each on that isn’t zero.,Then report back to on what you have discovered. Guessing isn’t going to do you or us any favors, let’s really work to find out why nearly 1 out of 20 customers who buy from you are unhappy (i.e. root cause(s))., If you are using a Windows 10 machine see if you have a button on your keyboard near the , key labeled ,. This is the Screen capture button, it will either load an image of the screen to your clipboard or save it to a file on your hard disk.

"New FBA seller, Purchased Invoice from supplier",Selling on Amazon,"I am in the process of trying to get an approval to sell on Amazon, but Amazon is requesting a “purchased” invoice from supplier or manufacturer.

However, Amazon still would not accept the invoice document states "" ,""  Frankly, I don’t want to risk of purchasing the products from China to get a “,” invoice, but only to get reject by Amazon , for whatever reasons.,
Has anyone dealt with this issue before and what ways to resolved it.   As you know, its difficult to get in contact with Amazon via phone.   If any one could help, I appreciated.,Regards,,Sorry, that is the risk of selling on Amazon. Amazon is not the only game in town. If you product will sell on Amazon it should also sell on many other marketplaces. Amazon will also limit your new ASIN to probably a quantity of 200.,You should also know that depending on the product, Amazon may not like your China supplier.,You should also be worried that your random product from China may infringe on someones trademark or patent. Are there already 100 or 1,000 listings on Amazon that look just like the product you plan to sell?

Fix Stranded Inventory - Listing error,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","What is the deal?,I suddenly have 6 titles (I sell books) listed on the Fix Stranded Inventory page.  The reason for all 6 six is “Listing Error”,I finally was able to create a case - one FNSKU at a time.  I’m hoping this error will be fixed, but I am worried as several of these titles are fast sellers with good prices.,Does anyone have any insight.  Is it happening to anyone else.,Did you find a fix too this issue?,Yes and no.  It has appeared and disappeared about 7 times over the last 2 weeks.  At one point is was 28 items.  Seller support was useless.  Right now, it is fixed.  Who knows what will happen tomorrow.,I had a similar issue with Listing Errors and seem to have it fixed by removing “FDA Approved” from my product description.,Hello! I shipped out a box a few days ago and it is still in transit.  The entire contents of this box are appearing under my stranded inventory as well.  Were you able to figure out if it fixes itself once received?  Thank you!,Sometimes it does.  Sometimes it does after I go through a bunch of useless instructions from Seller Support.  Right now they are gone, but I don’t expect it to last.  I said more about it here - ,I spoke too soon.  I now have 25 stranded listings.  All 25 are from 2 shipments that have been delivered but not checked in or received.  All of the listings are listed as “inbound”.  None of them can have a removal order created.,It is a flaw in the system that needs to be fixed.,This has just happened to me I have 31units of stranded inventory. I still don’t think they have gotten fully through and accepted by amazon yet. I’m also using accelerlist if that has anything to do with it.,Add me to the list 18 books I sent in are all stranded for the reason.,I’ve been trying to get stranded inventory returned since July. Three removal orders have each cancelled the items I’m trying to have returned. Support keeps saying to create a new removal order. Something is not right.,This has happened to us multiple times. It seems to work itself out eventually. Currently have 28 items stranded. Seems to happen to all media items.,In case you haven’t read the other threads on this subject.  You probably have them because you are enrolled in the “head start” program.  You can opt out of the program."
Buyer threatening me with a lawsuit?,"Selling on Amazon,Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns","Seller Support has been known to get it wrong.,I think the worst and most likely retaliation would be negative reviews and feedback and/or a charge dispute (i.e. chargeback).,Not from me, the buyer has a right to request a refund, which is not the same as just handing out refunds. And Sellers have an obligation to notify Buyers when the package will not arrive by the promised delivery date. Seller’s in my opinion are also obligated to advise Buyer’s if their order will not arrive when it should that they have a right to request a refund. Which again is not quite the same thing as automatic refund for a missed delivery date. And to be very clear I don’t think Buyer’s are entitled nor should they keep ‘free’ product becuase it arrives late.,Often the application of law in a specific situation is silly, unreasonable, and/or just stupid and impossible. But that doesn’t really change much. Buyer should have a little human decency and show a modicum of understanding for situations that are extremely unavoidable. Such as carrier delays due to overwhelming seasonal volume increases, or a massive blizzard in their location. Unfortunately, some people just aren’t particularly decent or nice. And in this instance some morons in Washington, didn’t write a very well rounded law, with provision for extraordinary situations.,Did the morons in Washington ever get anything correct ?,There was that one time, when they recessed. But then they changed their minds and went back.,Thanks for the info.  I thought I was going crazy trying to find it.,
I remember it was also released by Amazon as a topic in the forums but I have not been able to find that one either.,I noticed the language of the commitment to cover INR claims if we purchased buy shipping has changed in the news articles and pages that I have previously bookmarked which is quite frustrating and disturbing.,For example, the phrase in the 2016 news article stating, “In fact, you won’t receive a notification about it” doesn’t show up in existence anywhere (that I have found), so I assume Amazon has retracted this commitment since I have in fact received notice of A-Z claims for INR.,They also no longer refer to it as INR claims and simply state “problems with delivery” in their buy-shipping commitment.  I am assuming that is what is causing all the issues for sellers now with the USPS mess.  This ambiguous language is allowing case handlers to state that tracking has to show “delivered” in order for their to be a “problem with delivery”.,This person can’t complete a sentence.  I would be truly shocked if they “had a lawyer” to even contact!,Our curiosity over the FTC rule continues so perhaps, as you seem to have a lot,
of knowledge concerning it, you will be able to clarify our comments below.,We can not find this anywhere on the official FTC web site.,
Specifically ,   date.,We do see that merchants are required to notify buyers if the merchant can not ,  within the advertised ,  date, or 30 days if no shipment date is advertised.,We see no wording to the effect of ,  under this rule.,What we do find under the rule is that a online merchant is required to ,  either within the advertised shipping frame or 30 days if they do not advertise a shipment date.,It appears the merchant is also required to refund the customer if they can not ,  within either the advertised time, 30 days or customer agreed delayed time frame.,The rule makes no mention whatsoever, that we can see, that a merchant is required to refund a customers purchase if it is not , to the customer within the above time frames by the shipping service provided that the product has been shipped and received by the shipping carrier within those time frames.,It appears to us that the FTC is not holding merchants responsible for the delays that a shipping service may encounter nor requiring merchants to have a guaranteed or promised ,  date.,If you are of a mind to clarify this we think it would be helpful to a lot of sellers including ourselves.,We think most merchants (sellers) do not mind canceling and refunding an order they can not ship.,
(that should rarely if ever happen),The contention is, as we see it, the assertion that merchants must refund late arriving orders that they have shipped on time or run afoul of FTC regulations.,Clarity please. ,Some of what our curiosity led to.,Excellent, desperado, thank you!  So we are only responsible for how we ship, not how we deliver.,That is how we read it.,
We read the entire rule, which is more comprehensive than the screen shot above,,
on the FTC website.,We are waiting for The_Sawle_Mill to respond for clarity however.,
They seem to know a lot more about this than we do.,You have a good grasp on that particular consumer right, now take what you have and investigate truth in advertising. Amazon A-Z guarantee and the delivery window also are applicable. Since at the time of checkout customers were provided with a Delivery Window and quite frankly the law doesn’t care if you delivery the order in person, pay the USPS to deliver the order, or give it to Santa Claus for delivery. Since the Seller and not the Buyer selected and paid the carrier, the carrier is an agent of the Seller and the Seller is responsible to the Buyer for when the carrier blows it. If the order isn’t there when or before you said it would be you have violated the truth in advertising portion of the law. The Buyer is entitled to a full refund for not getting the product or service that was promised. In this case USPS or Jolly Saint Nick (who exactly is irrelevant) didn’t deliver the promised service  and the Buyer is entitled to a refund upon request.,May 1, 2016 is when the current INR policy was placed on the Amazon site.  Prior to that date, there was nothing.   ,Thank you for clarifying that the FTC does not have a rule that punishes merchants for deliveries that are delivered late by the carrier provided the merchant ships as advertised, within 30 days or within an customer agreed upon delay period.,We agree.,
It just has nothing to do with the FTC concerning delivery times.,We would hope that responsible sellers would refund a customer when it becomes clear that the package has been truly lost or damaged but not just because it is running ,.,
They can then file a claim with the carrier.,The information on the FTC website concerning Truth In Advertising does,
not address , times.,
It only refers merchants to the prompt delivery rule pictured above.,While the law does address a lot of categories, we found no evidence that,
a delivery window was considered an advertised guarantee that if,
not met would run afoul of the law.,A delivery window is an estimate based on reliable averaged,
data over time.,
It is not an advertised promise.,That is why it covers more than one date.,
It may arrive a little early or it may arrive a little late.,
It is not an advertised guarantee.,Even Amazon does not guarantee delivery dates in many circumstances.,From Amazon concerning “guaranteed” delivery dates for products that are eligible:,
(not all are),“The guarantee does not apply if we miss our promised delivery date because of an unforeseen circumstance outside of our control, such as a strike, natural disaster, or severe winter storm. Also, delivery scans might be inaccurate.”,
(or we might be in a pandemic and its holiday time),Reading this suggests that Amazon is running afoul of the Truth In Advertising Law,
but they are not because delivery times do not apply to the law as far as we can see.,We agree in so much that if the customer does not , the product they are entitled,
to a refund upon request but not just because it is delivered later than the delivery,
estimate at time of order.,A responsible seller will refund such an order without the customer having to request it,
when there is ample evidence that the customers order will not be delivered.,Agreed,
Amazon policies are always applicable to sellers even when they differ,
from actual laws.,Thanks for helping us clarify this issue for ourselves and other sellers.,
That’s probably enough learning for today.,
Our brains are hurting.,The problem seems to be, sellers do not understand how Amazon works with INR claims when purchasing shipping thru their site.  We have always sent the letter posted above.  It only states Amazon’s INR policy.  No Fluff, no I’m sorry, no I’ll look into it for you.  It looks like sellers who apologize, or offer to look into it, or banter back and forth with the buyer, or give partial or full refunds, are not supported with the plan.  Amazon seems to believe the seller lead the buyer on that they would handle the situation, and Amazon simply lets them.,This week we had 3 INR’s paid from out account.  These were submitted by Amazon Seller Services on behalf of the buyer.  They did not follow the proper instructions we sent.  They were each appealed, and to our surprise within 2 days the payment was returned to our account.   ,Remember that some Sellers are also being screwed over by USPS in particular (but all carriers in general) under the ship by in the previous law. Since tracking is supplied, if a carrier doesn’t show an acceptance scan in tracking in time to complete the delivery within the Window. Then Sellers are clearly proven to not have shipped when promised. (Fair? Absolutely not),While I can see where you are coming from, remember that the totality of FTC laws and regulations is titled “Consumer Protections”. It isn’t fair, but it should be interpreted broadly to mean that when in ambiguous the law should favor the consumer and defer to the Seller. (Again, fair? And again, not really),And of course the all encompassing and overriding factor that can’t be overlooked has been well articulated by our good selling buddy , who has observed;,Which seems accurate. It may not be reality, but Amazon operates on taking care of the customer first and foremost rapidly and with automated sterility. If there is a dispute to resolve about Amazon or the Seller bearing the cost of a customer complaint (and let’s be realistic this season it had to have been millions), Amazon feels that can be hashed out later and privately. When Sellers put themselves right now above the customer, Amazon is not sympathetic. A Sellers immediate cashflow, liquidity, upcoming obligations, etc. are not of interest to Amazon (although they maybe very pressing to the Seller). And Sellers need to understand that no matter how pressing or concerning their fiscal picture is to them, Amazon neither knows nor cares. But the faster Sellers (and Amazon) can resolve the deluge of Customer Complaints, Returns, and Refunds (which is extremely heavy during the average post Holiday period and should be assumed to be significantly larger this period), the sooner Amazon can turn their attention to resolving the ‘small, petty’ disputes between Amaozn and their Sellers."
Buyer threatening me with a lawsuit?,"Selling on Amazon,Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns","OP,,we use a variation of this replay SELLC mentioned to customers with INR (item not received) or DNR (did not receive) claims.,""Since you paid Amazon directly, and the package was shipped with Amazon’s shipping account, Amazon would do the refund, but we can tell you the steps and they are pretty easy:,The “package didn’t arrive” reason will not appear if still within three days of the delivery window so it may not be possible to do this until tomorrow, but that would be an option at that time."",The last line has to be adjusted, but it works very well for us.,The only issue is that this system does not go live for 48 hours (I believe) after they first message and 3 days after the last scheduled delivery date.,This is where there is occasionally some pushback.,What do people tell customers about these delays?  I tell them that I think the delay is for insurance purposes or so we have time to investigate and that seems to help.,What do other people say about the delay?,Just a hunch, but I doubt this buyer is actually going to file any kind of lawsuit against you (and what lawyer would even accept a case like this?). Good luck to them. I know it’s frustrating when buyers get so upset and confrontational but the best option is to just let them vent and avoid argumentative back-and-forth. Just stick to short, simple facts and reply kindly each time. Sorry this has happened.,You can sue anyone for just about anything. Frivolous litigation isn’t really enforced by judges right now. However, in the case of a buyer not receiving an order in a timely fashion, a decent attorney should have better than 50/50 at winning on the grounds of injury/damages because of the Federal Consumer Protection laws concerning truth in advertising. With a little digging and only a touch of subpoena abuse, they might even be able to get fairly hefty punitive damages in the right court.,report it to amazon.  Let amazon handle it,   tell them this is a terrorist threat and you will have it handled the correct fashion.,I have a couple of items in my inventory and I get spammers and scammers threatening me.  Click the report button and call amazon.  Let them do their thing.  Ignore it.  They have documentation.,Sue for what,  Lawsuit,  not even worth it.   waste of time.  Move on.the judge would laugh at them.,As you know, many people are part of the 92% of the population–that are takers, etc…You can clearly tell him that the address that is provided—IS CREATED BY THE BUYER when they order an item. If you purch on Amaz, you know this. So any errors–are his fault. Also, I’ve had several pkgs re-routed via Air to Midland, TX…Most like this is due to aircraft logistics, as many aircraft are not flying the routes they used to. (pre-pandemic). AND he needs to know and be more considerate that a pandemic and MAJ CHGS and disruptions to our world, transportation, etc…are gonna happen. And he needs to be patient—not demanding. Filing a lawsuit is simply just laughable and stupid (92%)…The costs for that are incredibly higher, over $300+. AND USPS is extremely slow. It took a mo. to mail pkgs to CAN, when it usually is 14-18 days. All the mail is backed up, I was told not enough help to move the mail.,Great answer but Seller Support is telling sellers to ask the customer to wait till they get the package and to refund on the returned items and not before. We have some from early Dec. that are moving again and will get delivered.,Most are accepting the answer and some are threatening BBB, attorneys, Amazon retaliation,. These are 9.99 to 39.99 items and we have 100’s still out waiting to get delivered.,Boy—you got that right! Buyers need a LONG course in patience and kindness. Not sure they know what those words mean.,We are curious about this constant mentioning of delivery time guarantees and the FTC.,We recently placed another order with *line and paid for 1 day delivery.,
(they offer no other options),Their web site does note that delivery can be delayed 1-3 days under,
the current circumstances.,It has been 4 days and no delivery.,We are disappointed but we are also reasonable.,We keep hearing the suggestion that *line is now compelled by , to immediately,
refund us, even though we know our order will eventually be delivered, because they missed,
their published delivery date.,While this could be true, we find it beyond ridiculous and are 100% certain they will not refund,
us for this reason.,We also surmise that if we attempted to file for a charge back with our bank, the bank likely would not,
grant it because *line could prove they shipped the items to us and that the items were eventually received by us.,Filing a case with the FTC over this issue, we find unwarranted, ridiculous and frivolous.,It seems to us that this line of defense for Amazon debiting sellers for late arriving shipments to customers, or advising sellers to refund for the same, is only relevant on Amazon.,We are reasonably certain that if we tried any of the above with *line they would simply close,
our account and stop selling to us… and we would deserve it.,Thank you everyone for the variety of answers! We even have a self-made Amazon lawyer in here.,

I drop off these packages (no matter how many that day) same day of purchase. Thank you all for the immense help.,I wouldn’t sweat it. Just do things by the book on Amazon. It’s highly unlikely you’ll get sued. There are a million remedies before such stupidly expensive measures on their part would be taken. Any lawyer worth their salt would laugh them out of the room. Unless you did something illegal. If it was just a delivery issue, yeah, don’t worry about it. You’re probably talking to a 13 or 14 year old kid. Really.,I would beg him to go out of his way and sue me.,I placed an order with a knife company on their website Tuesday morning at 11:00 EST,
The website clearly states all orders over $59 include free  2 day shipping (more like included in the price of the items )if placed by 2:00 pm EST.   That = delivery this week on Thursday( that’s perfect because I like receiving items the week I pay for it ),Order shipped from Georgia to a business address via FedEx home delivery. Georgia to my location ground is 3 days if no delays.,False advertising,The empty barrels often make the most noise.Threats should be reported to Amazon but do not be concerned and if you look into the legalities of this type of thing you will know why i said this.,No, we don’t do dropshipping; we import all of our items. Amazon gives me an address, I ship to it. I don’t mess around and change anything; it isn’t even worth thinking about that.,The quote comes from the 24May16 News Headline “Amazon now funds not-received claims on orders shipped via Shipping Services” - which as of the 25May16 revision , hosted @ , - which is no longer active at this time; I am not aware of a replacement (it appears that the rebranding of “Headlines” to “News” resulted in a decision to remove access to content older than 2018).,The actual text I copied when this Headline was new is:,“Amazon now funds not-received claims on orders shipped via Shipping Services,
May 25, 2016,
Effective May 1, 2016, if you’ve shipped an order using a label purchased from Shipping Services and buyers claim they didn’t receive their order and file an A-to-z claim, Amazon will cover that claim. In fact, you won’t receive a notification about it, and your Order Defect Rate will not be affected. Learn more about Order Not Received Claims.”,If memory serves, we also received e-mail notification on the 24th, but I’d have to dig around in our mail archives to verify that.,This was the criteria for many years; if I recall correctly, it appeared on the now-deprecated (also in the first ½ of 2018) Seller Help Content’s , to which that aforesaid Headline referred, as well as on the two-known iterations of the Customer Help Content’s “About A-to-z Guarantee” (@ , and ,.,Those CHC pages have recently (apparently, in the last two weeks or so) been revised, as have the Seller Help Content pages applicable to the A-to-z Guarantee Program; there’s a new ‘index’ page, , - the titles of four older pages have all been renamed to include that “(also referred to as “Claim(s)” in this help page)” legalese, and there are also 6 new “FAQ” pages linked there.,I’m still wading through updating out our own records of Amazon’s help pages re: A2Z in light of these recent changes (as a result of the slew of reports in the ASF that Amazon appears to be dropping the ball in holding up the BSS-coverage bargain in the wake of ,’s Delivery Carrier problems), and I haven’t even gotten to these new FAQs, so I’m not sure as of yet - but it at this point appears to me that the verbiage regarding 30 days is no longer extant.,That is disappointing we agree but are you demanding a refund, filing a charge back,,
filing a complaint with the FTC or filing a lawsuit?,Probably not because you seem a very reasonable and honest person.,It seems Amazon has bred customers who are exactly the opposite.,That’s all we were really trying to address in our post above.,Hope you get your knives soon.,Absolutely not.,I certainly won’t be doing more business with them.  ( a friend recommended them as a high quality lower priced knife , Next time I will stick to the high quality high priced knifes),This.,Jurisdiction is law school 101. What is the dispute? (Item not received.),
Where is the dispute located? (Where the item was to be delivered.),
Could it be argued that the location is where the purchase was made? (Maybe, but,
the stronger case is where the delivery, as promised, failed.),I’m Not A Lawyer (INAL.)  This is not legal advice."
Buyer threatening me with a lawsuit?,"Selling on Amazon,Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns","Just my two cents, but this should have been handled better. If I am following along correctly, your customer placed an order on December 14th and was shipped on the same day. On December 30th the customer contacted you and informed you that they had not received their order (they had some irrelevant information about where it was per the USPS tracking system).,What you have failed to mention is what the Amazon promised delivery date was for the customer at checkout. If we assume that the delivery window is past, then the customer has an Item not received complaint (in the event that the delivery window provided by Amazon is not yet past then please disregard). In this instance not only was your response irrelevant but also did not conform to Amazon policy and you have set yourself up for some potential problems with Amazon.,First, the agreements between you, Amazon, and the Customer is that the order will arrive when promised. This is part of the A-Z Guarantee, you are obligated to disclose to the customer that due to an issue with the carrier, in this case the United State Postal Service, their order did not arrive when promised and that they are entitled to a full and complete refund. You then have two options.,You do not have the right contractually or legally to tell the customer quoting irrelevant policies manipulated in such a manner as to make it seem like this isn’t your problem. You have opened yourself up to a potential chargeback (which you will lose), and you also have most likely caused a future A-Z claim against the order to no longer reimbursable by Amazon, after it is granted. Both of which will have a negative impact on your Seller Account metrics.,Had you used either of the appropriate options, you could have messaged and/or mailed the customer a pre-paid return label and explained that when the package arrived, since they had not paid for the merchandise, they were not entitled to keep it and to please either refuse the package or ship it back unopened using the supplied prepaid return label or if they wanted to keep the product to contact Amazon and have them recharge their card.,I am sorry, but in my opinion, all you have done is frustrated a customer, who is feeling cheated and made them angry, while exposing yourself to a loss that you unnecessarily. Yes, the customer has every right to sue you, and they would win. Thankfully, the costs would be prohibitive, and their attorney will advice them to dispute the charge with the credit card company and to file a grievance against you with the FTC (which you relly don’t want to deal with).,I’ve had so many threats … i’m numb to them- It is amazing to me that people are so indignant.,I’m sorry your order hasn’t arrive yet, i’m not the postal service… file an A2Z claim, it’s that easy… geez.,We need the ability to block problem/scamming buyers.,
It causes a lot of stress on the system to allow dishonest people to operate their scams on Amazon without punishment. It what system, in any country, are criminals allowed to operate without consequences.,I live my life by 2 ideas nothing bothers me anymore ( I used to be mad all day long , I used to take all this personally ),1)Life is great , , happens,
2) G-d is great , beer , is good & people are crazy.,Correct me if I am wrong, but if I customer really wanted to sue you, they would have to file in the -jurisdiction of where your company is based? I have received threats from a few non Amazon customers who purchased on our web site. I just ignore them and laugh it off. It’s usually over them having to pay return shipping or not giving them a replacement on an item they damaged through misuse.,Reading your response and finding it very helpful.,
I have been trying to find the link for the above quote regarding the May 1, 2016 announcement but can’t find it.  Could you please share the link to it.,(post withdrawn by author, will be automatically deleted in 24 hours unless flagged),That is incorrect. The customer has every right to file in their own jurisdiction. After all the product was shipped to and did not arrive at that destination. If the defendant petitioned that the jurisdiction was incorrect a judge would never permit it to be refiled in the defendant’s jurisdiction, they might dismiss and require it be filed in Washington, if the arguments and evidence were compelling for the defendant. However, most likely this would be a small claims court and that is always in the plaintiff’s jurisdiction.,Thank you for this idea.  I have been saving “Templates” on my Iphone for years and it never occurred to me I could streamline the process.  Actually I should thank my neighbors for setting off fireworks from 10:PM to 2:AM last night which allowed me to stumble across this response.  Either way - Thanks!,Yes–we too, after giving a refund (just to shut him up) --we had abuyer email us that they wanted to leave us the worse review because we were thieves, fraudulent etc., and they wanted to advise other buyers to never purchase from us as his item arrived late (after christmas), although we shipped December 3rd --because, as he wrote “you sellers were totally responsible for the USPS late shipments this whole holiday season.”,No Response Needed.  and then “Delete” was our “response.”  Not worth our time, or energy to even respond.,MAYBE you a can talk to a HUMAN VOICE at AMAZON, but it will be like asking for Jesus without praying…You might through or a call back. REPORT THE BUYER MAKE SURE YOU TELL AMAZON TO CHECK HIS/HER HISTORY so they (AMAZON) can see if it’s a normal pattern with this buyer. STAY ON TOP OF THIS! You might get an ugly feedback…but even that can be removed via by NOTIFYING AMAZON! Hang in there it’s gonna be one of several fights you will encounter. Welcome to the Sellers Club  ,Two quick things about lawsuit threats, even if you’re guilty. 1) Out of state buyer can only sue you in your state, and your county. Very expensive…unless he/she’s rich and just wants to target you. 2) Two he must PROVE his case, without guarantee you will pay his legal exepnses. Unless you’re talking a multi-thousands of dollar deal, don’t lose sleep. All he can do is give you negative feedback and go kill his neighbor’s cat, not yours,CORRECTED:,

You might get an ugly feedback…but even that can be removed via by NOTIFYING AMAZON! Hang in there it’s gonna be one of several fights you will encounter. Welcome to the Sellers Club  ,Why are so many sellers reporting that when they bought shipping through Amazon, Amazon is not honoring INR claims and they are counting the A-to-z against the seller and deducting the funds from their accounts?  What’s the catch?,Personal experience has been VERY different. I have never been sued in my State. Are you 100% sure about that? If so I need a better attorney.,OP, can you intercept the package and have it returned to you.  Someone on this forum said you can do so.,
You can request that the destination Post Office hold the item for you or have it returned to sender.,Tell them to sue, and you’ll counter sue for them wasting your time. Hey, I ve seen it happen.,NEVER HIT NO RESPONSE unless u want 2 get bitten =take out a case u b covered,His lawyer, haha he can’t afford a lawyer, and most people who threaten to sue can’t either,Can you please explain how this person would win a lawsuit for an item that was delayed by and then delivered by USPS?"
Buyer threatening me with a lawsuit?,"Selling on Amazon,Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns","Hello everyone! I’m a new Amazon seller here for a month now (100 items sold only). But this is the first instance of a buyer threatening a lawsuit on us for USPS’s mistake. He originally told me that we sent it to the wrong zip code because on USPS’s tracking, it said it was forwarded. In reality, it was forwarded because it was in the wrong sorting facility.,Dec 30th (9:49 am) Buyer: “It said it got the wrong zip code and been forward back I want my money back I knew I should of got the other one from the other company had a feeling this was gonna happen go to wrong address an I don’t get it”,Dec 30th (9:53 am) Us: This is your label that Amazon gave us, is this not the correct address? (With included Amazon label via PDF).,Dec 31st (5:14 am) He sends me the entire USPS tracking info.,Dec 31st (5:15 am) “So since you wanna be disrespectful I really want my money back now I already notified amazon bad business u can contact Usps since u blaming them why it’s lost I’m alset”,Dec 31st (5:18 am) “And I will file a law suit I don’t care if it was a penny you not gonna rob people during a global pandemic then be disrespectful about it make sure my lawyer gets this message u sent to an he gonna have everything from AK int Trading”,My strategy in the beginning was to just wait it out, sometimes USPS is slow; especially in these series of events. Then, if it didn’t move; I would just give him the full refund, because it wasn’t even worth fighting for it. I even contacted USPS via their website. Then it gets delivered today and I get this nasty message in my inbox. Not sure how I’m “robbing” anyone.,Not sure what to do besides just reporting them for threats.,Always keep everything short and sweet.  Report to Amazon like you already said.  This won’t be your first or last of problems.  Do not engage in non essential communications, hence “No Response Needed” button.,You have to know Amazon’s policies.,When you follow Amazon’s policies, there is nothing to worry about.  The buyer is just making a fool of himself.  Now if you banter back and forth with the buyer.  Amazon has been known to simply refund the buyer from your account when they complain to Amazon.   ,Thank you for the response! Yes, all of my shipments are bought through Amazon, because I did my research and always fall back on Amazon’s shipping. Didn’t banter back, because it just went super overboard. I just reported it and left it up to Amazon; not worth arguing over.,Good.  This is the letter we send over and over.   ,I also had a customer , to sue me, just a few weeks ago.,It was a good laugh. No response needed.,I had a customer threaten to sue me because we only gave him a $0.01 refund. The item he returned did not match what we shipped him, the evidence is still sitting in my returns department.( normally we give the customer 30 days to provide a prepaid label if they want the item they sent us “in error “ to be sent back to them ),Oh yes! I was reading your post because I wanted to see if anyone else had this kind of experience, haha. It was a good laugh reading it this morning.,How can this be your fault? With buy shipping you have no say in what the address is, it is whatever the customer tells Amazon.,What is your success rate with this?,I just had two identical A to Z cases decided differently.  Both were shipped on time and used Amazon buy shipping.  One changed to Amazon funded after appeal, the other upheld after appeal citing “non receipt”.  Didn’t miss any communications with the buyer - did everything by the book.,Guaranteed they won’t file a lawsuit, again I can guarantee you 100% they will not file a lawsuit. Sorry for retarding customer waste your time.,Trackings have been wild, but when they go around what should have been a center, there is either a backlog or covid issue.,
Buyers are less than patient this year. I set my shipping times to the furthest possible… Orders from the 15th on said deliver by 28th. They hoped 24th and were upset when they got it by the 28th. One buyer wanted to return her item on the 15th  because it arrived after xmas (they celebrate a week early).,
This year, shipping has been delayed so often. I wish Amazon would not send buyers  emails to request refunds because the item is late. I can’t count the emails I get every day and I think one or two are not rude or angry. Most are misspelled and good grammar is optional. And the items are usually delivered the next day.  Most items are delayed about a week, but are delivered.,
All in all, holiday season has never been quite like this one.,Just to add, you make something like this a template, then you can add placeholders that are filled in with the correct info,[BUYER_NAME],
[SHIPPING_CARRIER],
[DATE_SHIPPED],
[DELIVER_BY_DATE],
[ORDER_ID],
[PURCHASE_DATE],
[SELLER_NAME],
[SHIP_BY_DATE],
[SHIPMENT_STATUS],
[SHIPPING_TRACKING_NUMBER],Edited. …,Do a Refund…& Hope It Doesn’t Happen Again… Are You Dropshipping? Was there a mistake on the address?,Amazon has covered them all.  I tend to see there is a difference in how they are placed.  When a buyer calls Seller Services asking for help in an INR complaint.  They tend to just refund from the sellers account, thus causing the writing on an appeal.  If they file thru their order page, Amazon has funded directly from their account.   ,Good idea.  We stock many templates made this way with fluff in between.   ,You handled it well. (Although I’m less inclined toward refunds for late deliveries). When starting out the rabid buyer emails can seem intimidating. But after you’ve been selling for a while you learn to enjoy the nutjob buyers for a laugh. Post them to the board here, we all like to share our holiday fruitcakes!,This person is a typical Amazon scam artist.,I would send a short message saying something like:  “I’m sorry you are unhappy with your buying experience. If you wish to return your item, please go to your order page and request a return. Amazon will issue you a prepaid label and as soon as we receive the item we will issue you a full refund”  Then don’t answer any more emails.,

How to sue Amazon/arbitrate to get funds back,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","Hi guys it has been a horrific past year for me. I lost everything after Amazon suspended my account. I had tens of thousands of products stuck in the warehouse and 20K withheld on my seller account. After 120 days of my Amazon account deactivation, today I finally received an email regarding my funds appeal after countless attempts:,
_ _,
,
_The funds in your account will not be disbursed to you. This is a final decision made after reviewing the information you provided. _,
_ _,
,Now I just want my funds released since I don’t have anything to pay my rent and food. It is a huge mistake to put all eggs into a basket. If anyone has gone down this path of legal action, please share your experience so that I can be better prepared to conduct the process.,I don’t mean to sound harsh but the forums is not the place to look for advice on this issue. Only a qualified attorney can help you with this. However, I did read somewhere that absent a serious error,  ,  only  ,  permanently when a seller earned those  ,  illegally. So if the funds were obtained illegally you may not have much recourse.,You can go to YouTube and in the search bar on that site enter , and there is an attorney who has some videos up there explaining how some of these things are happening.,Sounds like you infringed on a major brand. Sort of like Popsockets is like sort of selling fake Nikes.,No idea what RyanMedical has to do with a phone product. You may be lucky that the brand did not come after you in court.,You signed a contract agreeing to binding arbitration.,Especially considering this is Amazon’s personal forum…,Seek competent legal advice, arbitration is going to be kinder towards Sellers than the courts and will cost far less than litigation. Arbitration is legally binding and so you are entitled to be represented by counsel in the matter. You attorney can also more easily get the details concerning the hold and explain to you if it is wise or possible to recoup losses and/or damages. Most competent and ethical Attorneys do not charge for an initial consult because they want to be sure that you can pay, that your case is legitimate (and has a chance in hell), and if they want to work with/for you. If they charge you even $1.00 they are legally obliged to represent you in the matter.,Amazon does not release inventory or funds, from , your orders, even if some of the orders had nothing to do with the complaint.,hi , all these sellers are correct if we cut to the chase and tell use what was it exactly  you were selling maybe someone will be able to give better advise ill be waiting to hear what the products are,I totally agree. However, I was authorized to sell Popsockets products as I applied to become an official distributor. Even that, I never actually sold any product related to Popsocket and all of the revenue was generated from other listings. The only thing is that I submitted a screenshot of email as my letter of authorization since I do not have the official document,Then you don’t have documentary evidence of authorization. You have more grievance against your supplier than Amazon."

Has anyone been approved lately? I filled out this form over a month ago and still have yet to get any confirmation or denial. I’ve had several listings that were removed that were added several weeks ago under this new Policy (which was never communicated to sellers well).,Quick update, another product flagged as restricted due to this new policy, this time one that was almost a year old…,It’s a Sellers Forum, and I agree let’s keep it on Selling. The only time Covid should come into the topic is if it’s an issue with selling. If it’s a general rant about just Covid, then there are other forums to bring that up, just not here on this forum.  Some people need to take a breath and not read more into what’s there and clearly not what the OP is talking about.,Apparently you did not understand what my post is about. Amazon has introduced new policies regarding products sold in certain categories (For if you decide to read: ,). The New listing creation form is required for selling products in the catergories.,Next time read as my question clearly pertains to the ability to sell products and “selling” as you so put it.,Apparently you did not understand I was responding to the moderators post. Not yours. Next time LOOK before you get all self defensive for nothing.,Creating a new thread would have been appropriate.,The bot based process of of detecting these products is full of flaws and there are a vast number of cases open in the system,I agree the pressure out there and unfortunately some fraud has just spiraled and we too are suffering.,a customer who stalked us found our home left messages on home phone that the police felt were threatening  and filed reports on ,  yet she has been allowed to leave feedback and say we sold her a used pair of sneakers after she tried  them on and wore them and then tried to keep them by saying they were used and she wasnt touching them to return them.,Amazon is aware of filed reports on her buyer messages and then phone call threats etc and the case is closed it seems they just allowed the hit to me and were good sellers.,We however are suffering the consequences of being stalked and threatened all so she could keep a 175 pair of shoes.,We sellers need some help with feedback and some other things just like buyers got extensions on returns etc.  We are all havuing trouble and I am sure Amazon and there skematics and Algorythms could not possibly account for this but we do need some human intervention,Very good points! Thank you!,We are concerned about the Purpose of Amazon Policy about COVID-19, which did not protect seller’s account, on the contrary it hurt seller’s account,especially the Counting Method about ODR.,According to this policy:,
“Beginning June 1, we will restart tracking and enforcing selling accounts with high cancellation rate, late shipment rate, or order defect rate per our established order performance standards. Any order performance defects showing in your Account Health page from prior to June 1 will not be used to evaluate your account health.”,We understand this policy was intend to protect seller’s account to avoid to affected by COVID-19. But the way of Amazon count the total orders in 60 days Time Window about ODR, make thing to became bad. This policy did not protect seller’s account, on the contrary it hurt seller’s account/ or make seller account at risk.,Why we said so?,ODR: It’s all orders with a defect (defined below) as a percentage of total orders during a given 60-day time period.,For our ODR(Window time April 12- June 10), now the Numerator is 2. If no ""Amazon’s protect policy about COVID-19 "", the Denominator is 405, then our ODR is 2/405. But now because Amazon’s this Policy, the Denominator is 78, then our ODR is 2/78(Because Amazon only count the total orders from June 1).,So we request Amazon to think, why this Policy did not protect seller’s account from the affect of COVID-19, on the contrary it hurt seller’s account.,In one words, If there was no Amazon temporary policy about COVID-19 to protect our seller account, our account was health. But now our account was at risk and lost the buy box at same time.,We request Amazon to revise this mistake Counting method about ODR. If Amazon was intend to protect seller account from COVID-19, why not ignore the defected orders(Numerator) that impacted by COVID-19 , but reduce the totals orders(Denominator)?,If so, we hope there was no  Amazon Policy about COVID-19.,that is just horrible … i’m sorry you and your family had to go through that …,i am curious though, how did this customer find your house and your phone number?,Bump."
[Mod Post] Regarding the novel coronavirus (COVID-19),Selling on Amazon,"Hello Sellers,,Amazon is concerned about the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), as seen on our , posted February 7.,We are seeing an increase in the number of off-topic coronavirus posts made in the forums. Please be mindful and refrain from posting about the coronavirus when it is off-topic, as per the ,.,Additional information: ,.,Best regards,,
The Moderators,Can you please define for us what is on topic?,Is it okay to start a thread on sanitary packing techniques?,
How about a thread on the safe handling and buying of items at a garage sale?,I think you would be ok with doing that.,There is no way that a starting a thread could be “off-topic”.,Since it is the topic ,Hey ,
I think since it is the main topic of everyone’s day to day conversation it is to be expected to a degree.,
We hope that Amazon will keep sellers informed of any closures or changes that are going to be made because of this virus and it will  help stop the gossip and off topic conversations. Personally, I have seen too many “Warehouses are closing” and doom and gloom alarmist posts and appreciate your post but also send a tremendous amount of inventory to you and am hoping that Amazon keeps us all informed of any changes as they arise and not leave us in the dark.,So it would seem to a reasonable person.  But there are lots of off-topic posts in many threads, and they seldom get remarked upon by mods.,It seems odd that a mod would focus on off topic CV-19 posts and not other off-topic posts.  I was wondering if this was a roundabout way of saying “No CV-19 posts.”,What I was trying to determine is if CV19 posts are permitted at all.,That’s very true.,I understand that CV-19 is an important subject that impacts sellers on a daily basis. However it seems that occasionally when folks get off-topic with CV-19, things tend to occasionally get ugly, very quickly. Including wildly inaccurate scientific information, as well as comments which could be perceived as racist.,While the propagation of misinformation isn’t explicitly prohibited, it’s certainly not helpful and it can be dangerous. However, insulting groups of people is prohibited.,So like I said, I have no idea what Amazon’s thinking is. But, it’s my best guess they might want to shut things down more quickly on these posts, before things go too far off the rails.,Or when you’re posting on topic threads about it those seem to be an issue too.,Thats kind of what I thought when mine got locked. Seems the rules change daily in here now. Or maybe they change according to the poster.,Thank you.  I am glad to see that Amazon is doing its part to reduce panic and the politicization of health matters.,Having said that, Costco appears to be limiting its traditional handouts of samples in some of its stores.,Now THAT is a crisis.,I think Amazon just wants us to not talk about it. Just “The Man” trying to keep us down!,Amazon news reports claim they’ve cracked down on the price gouging. Amazon sellers who open threads to claim otherwise might draw undue controversial attention to the issue. Amazon has solved the problem, no need for discussion.,My thread was locked too. “Seattle Postal Worker tests positive for Coronavirus.” A little too close to the Amazon headquarters perhaps.,We are long past that.,Amazon announced on March 3rd that one of its Seattle area employees had tested positive for the virus,I do not think the topics themselves get threads locked, but the wild speculation and misinformation that always appear.s does  Plus the topic seems to bring out a lot of aggression in people.,Addressing the problem is not the same as solving it.  Amazon is so huge that there is no way they can simply eliminate price gouging.  I suspect I could do a few simple searches and find examples in minutes.,It was an attempt at satire, hence why the smiley was added to my post.,Sorry, I missed it.  I would suggest , as a sarcasm emoji, lol.,All I know is I wouldn’t be buying anything from CHINA, Italy or South Korea.  I would also like to mention eventually when the post office closes offices…you will need to find a place to ship your stuff either fedx UPS ,IPS with Doug Hefferenan or somehow besides USPS.  the show must go on.,I used them to ship some Penguins to the zoo in Albany. What a mess.,They are also out of toilet paper which escalates the crisis in our view.,Sorry to bring this up but I have noticed a backlog of pending orders in my account. Is there any shortage of hands at the fulfillment centers because that is what it looks like with these amount of orders waiting to be fulfilled."
Amazon marking products as expired when they are not expired,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","Earlier this week we noticed that Amazon marked three of our SKUs as expired when they still have another six months of remaining shelf life (products are a one month supply).,We immediately sent a message to seller support, to which they replied:,Just now I receive an email that they’ve initiated a removal order for the “expired” products. I still have yet to hear an update from support and it has been three days.,I cancelled the removal order but don’t know if I did it in time.,What’s the deal with this? I shouldn’t have to get these products sent back to me only to ship them directly back to FBA. This is ridiculous.,Looks like they are using the same rules as the Passport Office.  Amazon expects the product to have a 6 month shelf life after the product is received.  Your products are on the edge of falling under that amount.    ,You mean Amazon isn’t following their own policies? Shocking,“At the time of check-in at the fulfillment center, all products must have a remaining shelf life that allows sufficient time for the product to be consumed in full plus an additional 90 days.”,This is happening more and more.  It’s always been a problem that Amazon’s system doesn’t always have the correct expiration date for products.  Now it’s taking them more than 30 days to send someone to look at the actual product for the expiration date.,IMHO they don’t have the manpower to do this.  It’s not helpful to the bottom line.  Perhaps that’s why it’s not top priority.,Automatic removal orders happen once products have been unfulfillable for 30 days.  Yes, we’ve had a few items returned to us because Amazon wasn’t able to verify the expiration date before the 30 days, and we were unable to cancel the removal order.,I guess my rambling today is just saying - yes, others out there are feeling it too.,That’s the bizarre part… they’ve only been unfulfillable for ~4 days. I was surprised to see the email for an auto removal order…,Do you have auto removals set to less than 30 days?   IIRC there is a setting.,We received the following message from support on 11/3, but there are still multiple units set as unfulfillable due to expiration date. Does anyone have suggestions on a next step?,After opening yet another case with support for a total of five SKUs, we were assured that all unfulfillable “expired” products would be moved back to fulfillable within 30 business days.,We were also assured that a disposal order would NOT be created in the meantime.,Can you guess what happened this morning? That’s right… a disposal order was created.,The sad part is this was all so predictable.,Bumping this because I still have inventory completely tied up that I can not even create a removal order for. In addition, I still have not received inventory from a removal order I submitted weeks ago. This is infuriating."
FBA sales notification,Selling on Amazon,This week I stopped getting notifications when my products sell on FBA.  Is this happening to anyone else?
How-to: Crossed-out price on the offer page?,Selling on Amazon,"Dear Community,,First of all: Happy New Year everyone!,We have a question that the support couldn’t help us with: ,For the new year we want to raise our prices. In the meantime, we still want to use the old price; the crossed-out price should indicate to our customers that they will soon have to expect a new price.,We know we have to make changes to the list price (MSRP), but we don’t know where to do this. In the inventory (“Edit”) we do not see such an option.,We are the manufacturer and brand owner of the products on Amazon.,Maybe someone knows the answer. I’ve attached a screenshot with any example.,Thank you for the help and take care!,Best regards,,
Angelo, ,I believe you edit the listing. Under the OFFER tab, about 1/2 way down,you will see 3 fields. Sale Price, Start Date, End Date. Fill those in and the listing. Then save and exit. The listing will appear with the temporary sale price and a crossed out reg price.,The display you are posting is created by going to your ad for the item, and putting the item on sale.  Now with that said, sometimes the ad displays with the strike thru posting, and sometimes it does not.  If it does not, the sale price is simply placed in your listing.  It is most likely bone by a bot.   "

The listing information described below may affect your ability to sell certain products.,As part of our ongoing efforts to provide the best possible customer experience, we are implementing approval requirements for Merrell products in the Shoes, Handbags & Sunglasses category.,
Effective on 2021-01-08, you will need approval to list the affected products. If you do not obtain approval to sell these products prior to 2021-01-08, your listings for these products will be removed.,
You are receiving this message because you have sold affected products in the past. There is no penalty associated with this action.,
If you would like to seek approval to sell the affected products, complete the following steps to start the application process:,We appreciate your cooperation in this important matter, and thank you for selling on Amazon.,Regards,,
Amazon Services,That just means the brand owner has contacted Amazon and said they only want manufacturer approved sellers offering their products on the Amazon site.  To prove you fall in that category, you simply need to provide your retail account invoices showing you purchase directly from the manufacturer.  If you are not buying from the manufacturer directly, your sales will be blocked.  It is simply an advanced warning of what is about to happen.    ,Great, thanks a lot "
Why is my product not selling,Selling on Amazon,"Hi sellers, I am new to selling on amazon and I listed my first product about 20 days ago but it seems like no body’s really interested in it. can you guys give me some advice about what I can do to make it sell more.,
ASIN:  B08Q5H6Q1V,Thanks.,The only thing I noticed was some incorrect English, and no space after punctuation.,Personally, I’ve never known anyone, family member or friend, that has ever worn a sleep mask. Maybe these aren’t so popular anymore??,Thank you for the reply but there are some sellers who sell couple hundred units a day of the same product with different colors or styles I just don’t understand why…,Well… First you need to correct some of the English. Your bullet-points contain some improper English that should be corrected. My suggestion is to make the statement in your bullet-point instead of explain. People don’t want to read huge blocks of text. Try to shorten things up a bit…,It doesn’t matter what other sellers have got going. You are asking about your selling. They probably have been on Amazon for awhile, and you are just getting started.,Clean things up, and hope for sales. You are Just Launched. Things take time.,Maybe because there are tens of thousands of virtually identical sleep masks on Amazon many that have higher rank than yours as well as a lot of reviews.,You can not just pick a generic product to private label and expect to get sales when there is a ton of competition unless you invest a lot of money into advertising.,PS, the obvious stealth incentivized review (real buyers that purchase for personal use don’t post photos of the item still in the package for items like a sleep mask) would be something that would make me avoid your product even if it was lower cost than similar products. Both of your reviews were also left on the same day (Christmas Eve) by buyers that have never reviewed another product. That is also suspicious.,Manipulating reviews is a sure way to get suspended.  Your reviews are obviously fake.  It takes time to build good metrics.,There 1195 masks ranked ahead of you.,
,Somewhere in there, may be your solution.   "

Customer threatening to sue me,Selling on Amazon,"Item showed delivered, but customer claimed he never got it.,In the first message to me he admitted packages have to be delivered “to the side door” or he won’t get them.,Claims he told UPS and Amazon this “hundreds of times.” I told him that it sounds like his problem is with Amazon and UPS, and not me, because I never got any delivery instructions.,He immediately leaves negative feedback and complains to the BBB. Tries to use this as a threat, but it’s already done anyway. Tries to use it as leverage, saying he will retract the BBB complaint if I resolve the issue (Amazon struck through the feedback).,He’s clearly fishing for a refund from me, without actually saying it outright. He asked me to “open a case” with UPS. I showed him with screenshots that that is not possible, because shipping was on Amazon’s account, so he needs to contact them.,He says Amazon won’t help him. Told him to file an A-Z. He does and loses. I tell him to try to appeal, and he says Amazon won’t even talk to him, and even closed his account (lol).,At that point I start marking all his angry messages “no response needed.” There’s obviously nothing I can do for the guy, and I’m not refunding him because he failed to enter the delivery instructions properly.,I have no idea why he was denied A-Z, or why Amazon closed his buyer account, but it doesn’t look good on him.,Anyway, he has sent me this message now, threatening to sue:,
,Anybody have any idea what I can expect from this, if anything?,Continue to ignore him. It sounds like Amazon has had enough issues with him that they will no longer sell to him.,Ah yes there is legal term for this… Owwwwww,Ignore it, nothing you can do. You are not responsible for mistakes on his end and you have proven to have met your obligations in sending an item as instructed. I find it strange they closed his account, might have had issues with amazon in the past.,No one who has to have stuff delivered to the side door has a “legal team”.  It’s bluster.,For Amazon to close a buyer account he has to have been doing something shady for a long time. That side-door scam only works for so long apparently.  Ignore him unless he lives in your town and can take you to small claims court, in which case you may have to show up.,          ,
,If Amazon had closed his account, he would not be messaging, you. Just keep wearing your mouse button out using the “No Response Needed” button. If the messages are getting to be numerous, 10+ add the “Report Message” button then the “No Response” button.,Of course, you do, this Buyer has a pattern of fraud and abuse and Amazon doesn’t want them as a customer (Which is extremely rare), enjoy the victory and envy of many other Sellers with dreams of having a bad customer fired.,BINZER,If he was serious about the side-door nonsense all they had to do is on the second line after his name right deliver to side door delivered a rear door deliver to wherever…,I occasionally have things like that --a big Sharpie I put in bold block type to note to the carrier…,Rear door, side door Etc… Many times people are subletting…,Smarter ones just have a PO box… with a street address anybody could deliver to…,Just chalk it up to pandemic craziness, roll-off off with it…,There are people these days they’re so not in control of their lives, they’re reaching out to just mess with people, because they can…,Only on Amazon…,, any update?"

But in the last week, I have only filed cases online, and every pkg for which I have done that has gotten the package moving. When filling out the case, I include a description of the outside of the package – packaging type, any unique markings, package contents. I had a pkg from 12/8 going to oklahoma city with no tracking except pre shipment recd. I opened a case and the OK sort facility supervisor emailed me the next morning to say USPS had not even recd the pkg from the shipper.,I quickly wrote back, explained that I am the shipper and that our origin sort facility was way overwhelmed so pkgs were being ridirected unscanned. I described the pkg, requested help in locating and delivering. 3 hours after my email he found the pkg at his facility, and entered a scan. It was delivered a day later. So, the online cases are working. Be informative, ask nicely for help.,Here’s how to file cases online:,– Scroll to the bottom of the USPS site,
– Left side, under ‘Help’, click on ‘contact us’,
– On the resulting page, enter a tracking number,
– Directly below the tracking info it generates, there will be something that says, need help with this package, contact us. And then a ‘Get started’ button. Click that and it will open a box to start a case.,
– You need to fill out tracking number, mail class, pkg type, pkg contents, value, “other tracking info”, sender’s address, recipient’s address, and then your contact info, and submit.,
– For the pkg contents, it’s a drop down category list. If my item doesn’t match any predefined category, I select “Unknown” and then I just explain it in the “Other tracking info” box.,
– I put detailed info in the “Other tracking info” box – when and where did USPS receive the pkg; what does the pkg look like ( if I used a priority mail branded box, I bstate that and say which specific box it was so they can look up size and shape); if there are any handling instructions on the box – fragile, glass, liquids, temperature etc I mention that; anything that makes the pkg unique, say for example a long tube wrapped in brown paper with priority tape and priority mail and fragile stickers. Etc. After the description I make a request saying this was to reach there for Christmas. Could you PLEASE locate it and have it delivered before the year is out? I would be so grateful for your help.,We still have dozens of packages unaccounted for, but today we gott several calls and emails in response to our cases, all from supervisors at different destination facilities saying pkease call us back, we want to help and need to ask you a few questions to further research the item.,I also got a call today from a manager at my local consumer affairs offering help given how many cases are open.,So, they are trying. And everyday we are seeing packages where we opened cases getting delivered.,So, file cases. It’s faster to do it yourself than calling. You need to bring the stuck packages to their attention for them to go dig them out and move them along.,We are starting to see somewhat more decent delivery times – not normal, but 7-10 days for priority, about what it was during the Spring pandemic surge –  for packages sent out this week. And lots of middle of the night and pre dawn scans.

And winter storms lue ahead in large swaths of the country. I suspect it will get bad again. If they can maintain at 7-10 days for delivery, we will be grateful, because we can plan around that.

It’s 2.80 buying from the platform’s shipping. - and the only one I lost - was not scanned.,If Scamazon had to refund all these orders, they would be bleeding financially.  So much better to pass the bleeding on to their “Selling Partners”.,I saw an Uncle Charlie in that trailer. True?,So far, I’ve only had 1 A-Z against me. Lost it due to USPS not scanning on time. I’ve gone through and filed claims on every late/missing/non-delivered USPS Priority Mail package and almost all have paid out including shipping so far.,Not feeling great about the current situation so I may wait an extra week to come back, especially if Amazon isn’t covering Buy Shipping INR claims like they used to. I can have the postal clerk scan in every package but if Amazon isn’t going to cover a 2 week late package I am not gonna sell…,Wait until it’s DELIVERED then you’ll REALLY see how the package is moving…,I had a whole freakin rant about this.,

“Hi, I ordered it in plenty of time to arrive for Christmas. I also ordered most of my items this year for my family of seven. This was the only late item. I think blaming it on COVID is a convenient excuse. I am the customer. Your product arriving late shouldn’t be my problem. I would like a refund.

The few I’ve done have worked overnight in getting the lost found and/or the stuck unglued. I was amazed at how effective this small step was. And buyers, I’m sure, appreciate the ship updates.,And the only one responsible for insuring that 9 year old’s Christmas wasn’t some 3rd party seller on Amazon. Parents need plan B’s, too. “I’ll have some manipulation with my coffee, please.”,A large part of the reason UPS has been able to manage packages better is that they stopped moving so much of Amazon’s FBA volume.,We have around 50 orders missing from the 7th.,This seems like a good thread to vent about USPS.,Ok, go a message from a customer today that has been waiting three weeks on an order and has not received it.  Wants a refund.  Reasonable.,I look at tracking and it was stuck in Alabama for a week and a half.,Not surprising this year, you may think… except we are in Minnesota and the customer is in Oregon!  How the ---- did the package find its way to Alabama?,But that is not the worst one.  A poor customer, sweet lady, in Louisville, KY just wants her (now late) gift.  She ordered three weeks ago so that is understandable.,The package coming out of Minnesota makes its way quickly to Indianapolis.  Ok, we are in great shape, Louisville is less than two hours from Louisville!  But, that is where our story takes a dark turn. Because then the package is then sent to Saint Louis, which is 4 hours from Louisville, wait what?,Ok, so then it is stuck in Saint Louis for a week and a half.  Ooooh, that’s not good.  But just when we were about to give up, we see a scan and the Post Office sends the package to… Memphis.  Ok, it is good we see movement, but Memphis is almost 6 hours from Louisville so… we keep getting farther way.,But it leaves Memphis in just 36 hours and the package motors up Interstate 40 through Nashville and then up Interstate 65 to Louisville.  Yeah!,Wait, no, the truck is still going through Cincinnati and Columbus and all the way to Pittsburgh.,Now the package is in Pittsburgh.  It had to drive through Louisville to get there!!!,
Arrrrggggghhhh!!!,Pittsburgh is more than 6 hours from Louisville.

Painful.,Safety is an illusion.,We buy our shipping through Amazon for the sole purpose of them paying for lost deliveries.,Other than a few packages shipped on the 22nd and the 24th, pretty much everything before Christmas has been delivered. Most things are arriving in a somewhat timely fashion,Why? Were you being chased by the bogeyman?,Maybe the Supervisors can come down out of their offices and help?  As a 3rd Generation Small business… guess who works the most and hardest during Holidays and busy times?  Me, the owner followed by management level employees.,My local post office has more Supervisors upstairs than employees working at the post office.,It’s never safe when you have to ever deal with Amazon Seller Support.,And truthfully, by completely dropping a ball on their UPS Mail Innovations. The PO I worked in for the holidays saw several sacks of packages from them, and we had, on average, 2 packages in each sack that were not for our location, and about 1-2 sacks per week tagged for us, but clearly meant for another city about an hour away. So about 5% of packages were misshipped, and 5% of sacks also were tagged in error.,For the others, the log jam has broken, and I would prolly expect things to return to normal in the 2nd week of January, after the election in GA is over. All POs in my area are getting everything out on a daily basis, and we’re still getting Xmas level receipts on the trucks. (Admittingly, we are also seeing the Priority packages with estimated delivery dates of 2 weeks ago just come in too…),I talk with the Post Office almost daily now and they feel they are clearing the backlog but I do not see it; We mailed 50 packages with the USPS on 12/7 and 12/8 (all 1st class and Priority) and they have only delivered 41 of them (81% on 2-5 days transit times, not good).,It is spotty though, I have sent mail from the East Coast to AZ and it got there 2-3 dis and them mail to the next town over too 2 weeks.,It seems like USPS is playing a game of Pinball, trying to see how many times they can bounce the ball (package) around. We have seen this with a few of our packages as well. One of the packages that I am still able to recall was going to south Florida, yet somehow made its way all the way up to Detroit, Michigan. There just does not seem to be any rhyme or reason with how some of the packages are bouncing around from one distribution to another.,I think the only “priority” we are getting here in GA is the dozens of voter mail and candidate endorsements we get flooded with daily, everything else is in a stall. I was appalled when a first class took 2 weeks to arrive from my local PO at the Atlanta hub (45 min away!) getting its first scan too.,And here I did the opposite. UPS was taking longer than usual to deliver. I ended up losing the product and money for delays in their shipping. Usually USPS will delver with in 2 or 3 days,They may never catch up! But why close your business because of USPS. UPS is still shipping and FedEx will get it done. ,With the exception of 1 order, Amazon has been handling refunds and eating the costs for all of the A-Z claims I received for postage purchased through Amazon. I do wish the customer service peeps would stop telling the customers that their packages are lost and to contact the seller for a refund though.,Backlog is still there. New mail sent late last week is moving at an acceptable speed.,

I shipped a toy on 12/6 and got a message Christmas Eve stating “i will have a very disappointed 9 year old tomorrow morning”  Geesh!,Don’t you love how people forget we still have a pandemic going on? I’ve had the same thing happen. People feel better tearing you apart because they didn’t get an item “that ruined their holiday”.

The last update is that it’s in Memphis and that was on Dec 7. How could I explain that to the buyer? I would be demanding a refund myself.

"Amazon is not honoring ""Amazon Buy Shipping""","Selling on Amazon,Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns","I know that the general consensus advice for lost or “delayed” shipments for FBM orders that were purchased via Amazon Buy Shipping is to direct the customer to open up an A to Z claim.

We virtually always ship on time, and in the following cases, we did ship on time.   Well, I’m here to tell everyone that isn’t aware of this at this point in time that Amazon is not honoring their own A to Z guarantee regarding sellers that use Amazon Buy Shipping, and you can expect to have your metrics hit for lost or delayed packages.,Like all of you, I’ve been dealing with an avalanche of pissed off entitled Amazon customers with lost or delayed shipments.   Usually I am confronted by 2 to 5 word messages, such as “refund now”, or “didn’t receive give money back”, followed by what I imagine is a hearty grunt and furrowed brow.  I kindly tell them the typical apology for the USPS issues, and then tell them process to open up an A to Z claim, and multiple times recently this has worked just fine - Amazon funds it and that’s that.,Here are two cases, back to back, where the facts didn’t matter:,Amazon’s Decision:,It is factually untrue that there is anything wrong with the tracking information I provided them, because it is the exact tracking number they gave me when I purchased the label via Amazon Buy Shipping.

Purchased postage through Amazon and shipped on time. Package was delivered but late. Claim was instantly closed against me. I was lucky enough to also receive a letter from my regional manager from USPS along with my postmaster stating USPS is having issues. They are not doing acceptance scans on some packages and that along with the delays is not my fault but is theirs and for me to provide this letter to Amazon to inform them if needed. I appealed and received a generic reply. I contacted Amazon for a second appeal and received the same generic reply.,When I get time I will continue to contact Amazon on this. Right now we are focusing on other orders. Thankfully at this time I have not had a lot of issues but it is stressful knowing Amazon will not protect you even though they have a policy that states clearly that they will.,I still am a little letdown that they have not provided some sort of relief to sellers. Maybe it is the case just for me but this month has been far worse than the mail issues that Covid brought when they stepped in and helped sellers then. I cannot speak for everyone but for me while I had issues they were nothing like this.,Good luck,One of my appeals was changed to Amazon funded, the other was denied and maintained as seller funded.  The cases are virtually identical.,Seems pretty clear that there is an unfortunate lack of consistency in the application of Amazon Buy Shipping policy.,I’ve said this before:,
It Is  completely  Asinine that Amazon’s INR Guarantee is only part of the A-z claim process.,

This is a buyer’s choice through the Amazon message system. The buyer chooses to opt-out of messages from sellers. Amazon leaves that up to THEIR BUYERS. Therein lies your issue. Amazon does not want you, or other sellers, trying to ‘manipulate’ them. This is a violation of Amazon policies anyway. You cannot contact a buyer regarding their feedback or review. This is looked at as manipulation.,Along with what , noted, here’s the real problem:,A large chunk of buyers have no idea how Amazon really works in terms of it being a million businesses latched onto a mega-platform.  They think they are buying from a giant - Amazon - directly.,This is why buyers take advantage of the returns policy and many other things.  They think they are just hurting a gigantic corporation that has all the $ in the world.,People are too busy, stressed, broke, sick to want to communicate.  They just want their stuff.  It’s the same reason why the feedback / product review rates have dropped off 50% in the last 12 months.,Anyway, maybe I am wrong, but I doubt it.  I’ve conducted some external research on the topic to verify my theory.  ,Happy New Year,Correct regarding product review; not correct regarding seller feedback.,But when the buyer sends a message to a seller, that seems to be a implicit statement that the buyer is willing to communicate with the seller. The opt-out should be set aside to let messages from the seller come through.,A better way to handle this would be letting the buyer choose an option that a seller cannot , a conversation.,If a buyer sends a message, the reply will not be blocked.  Doesn’t mean they will see it.,Even just a dot or flag! ,The Buyer can , view messages right in their account–Amazon could easily save themselves time, money, and resources by making this feature maximally more useful with minimal investment. ,I truly don’t understand their refusal on this small matter.,It’s not as it if would encourage sellers to badger the buyers.

No penalty , eh ?  How about a bunch of buyers trying to get refunds based on the false message that the item is delayed or lost ?,I’m in the same boat as everyone else. My VTR is now at 10.58%. This seems to be a reoccuring problem on Amazon going back to 11/19. Is this anything to be concerned about?  I’m also getting a lot of buyer emails asking for refunds or advising me that Amazon informed them their order is going to be either “extreamley late” “lost in transit” to that effect they are asking for refunds.

Refunds requested on 1 item, automatic refund on 1. I keep bugging customer service to get some resolution my case has been forwarded, but not follow up. I understand this is a systemic issue but rather than acknowledge this is an Amazon metrics/shipping glitch or breakdown, I’m sent a notification that the negligence is on my end, even if this is an automatic response. Some human beings need to work on this and communicate with sellers to a) acknowledge the problem b)assure sellers that Amazon is working to CORRECT this problem.,Update- So I contacted Amazon through email regarding this issue and their answer as best I could understand(it was written in poor English) was that I enter the tracking information too far in advance after shipping the package. Typically what I do is I will ship my package at the post office on the way to my other job. I will then work eight hours, get home and then confirm the shipment and provide the tracking number. I have been doing it this way to avoid an extra trip for years, so apparently there has been a change that no one thought was worthwhile to share with us. If this is the true reason for my VTR tanking, and I’m skeptical, that doesnt explain why some people have had the same issue but have said they confirm the shipment immediately after shipping it. ,It’s comical that they suggested that you enter the tracking too far in advance . The fractured English response that I got was that there was such a delay that the tracking did not get to the customer ahead to the product being delivered !  The truth is that I would go to the Post Office and come right home and enter the tracking immediately …,
So, I asked them to transfer me to someone else who could clarify what the heck they are doing differently which they didn’t find necessary to let Sellers know…,
Meanwhile, as my VTR is at 18% while Valid Tracking Usage Rate is 100%,Yes, I got the same message today from them TWICE! Since things are slow what I’m going to try and do is not upload the tracking numbers until I verify they are scanned an in transit. Normally we drop everything off and go and the tracking numbers are assigned the night before. Someone said they think Amazon is pinging the tracking numbers as soon as they are uploaded. So that is my plan of action for the moment.,That is the problem – we are in a guessing game .,
That being said – someone on the forums suggested that  one needs to wait until the item is scanned into a ‘central facility’  So, I have been waiting over night and making sure that my items have scanned into or out of ( in my case ) the San Jose hub,I Started buying Postage on AZ Recently if that means anything.,My Tracking Numbers are All Given and Delivery is not only on time but very fast…Yet my VTR is 7%!..,I checked all the packages individually for tracking numbers & delivery and everything is Normal…,This Metric has had a Serious Glitch for some time.,I vacationed my books since I don’t like getting warnings from AZ…,Back about Labor Day. And  Hope the Glitch is Fixed by Then…,VTR problems have been an ongoing problem, at regular intervals, for several years past:,In the meantime, you will still owe the $40 a month ( if you have a Pro account ) . I’m sure A will find and fix the glitch soon, since so many sellers are having the issue . I’m still in and fingers crossed …Have a nice vacation --See you after Labor Day"
Valid Tracking Rate plunges on some glitch on Amazon's end :-O,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","My valid tracking rate is typically 100% . This morning , while checking , I see 82% !! I downloaded the report and went through all of the items in question and verified that there is an exact match between my USPS receipts and the tracking number that I sent to each order by shipping confirmation. All of the orders in question shipped during a 4-day period June 20, 22, 23 and 24 ),
I suspect that the glitch may be that  Amazon may have the carrier incorrect ( ie UPS instead of USPS ) . I opened a case and fingers crossed they can restore my Performance to 100%,
Anyone else or just me ?,Did the orders get scanned the day you shipped them?,how would amazon have the wrong carrier when you enter it?,It’s the only thing I can think of that would make them invalid-- anything’s possible with Amazon,Not sure what you mean-- I shipped from 3 different Post Offices and everything delivered in 3 or 4 days…,It happened to me. How can we get this resolved? I hope it is a glitch.,First scan was late in occurring.,More likely of you drop off in a blue box or at a PO which does not scan at the counter.,Use a scan sheet.,I go to the counter always . I checked with the clerk and she said that once she issues the label to me , that the book is in the system.  I always get a paper receipt and save them all .,Unfortunately, USPS has multiple automated systems and the type of scan generated by buying a label differs. The could be in the system and not recognized by Amazon until they have another scan.,I recommend not buying at the counter. Other than for media mail which is the same at the PO as online, there are benefits to buying online.,They include better pricing for priority mail. Priority Mail Cubic Rate, First class parcel rates to 15.9 ounces, and if you buy from Amazon, INR protection.,Hi elephant,,
What exactly is your situation as far as VTR ?,My valid tracking rate fell to 28% today. Yet I know that all my tracking info was correct. It’s surely a glitch on their part. They’re sure slow to fix it.,28% – wow – I’m sure if this nonsense goes on, my VTR is headed there and below … ,I also posted this on the ""Shipping "" Forums, but , there are folks here who might benefit  :,
Thanks to Everyone who contributed to this thread . I have reviewed everyone’s comments and just want to check if I’ve got this right – Let me know if not-- Sandy,My practice of issuing Shipping Confirmations and Tracking immediately upon return home from the Post Office has been the same for many years.,
Apparently , Amazon timing of verifying tracking numbers has changed , without notification to Sellers .,
Theoretically, Amazon is able to ‘handshake’ with United States Postal Service ( USPS ) data base only once the item reaches some central hub. Previously, Amazon has verified tracking numbers after some period of delay, perhaps 24 hours after submission , to allow for transit time to a central hub.,
Now, it seems that Amazon is attempting verifying tracking immediately as they are submitted.,
Since I purchase tracking at the local Post Office and submit immediately afterwards, Amazon is unable to verify, and so, flags those tracking numbers as ""Invalid "" .,
Since these tracking numbers are considered invalid, Amazon is not forwarding the shipping information and tracking numbers to the Buyers.,
To add insult to injury, it has come to my attention that when Buyers attempt to track their order , they have been getting a message from Amazon that the item may be lost in transit !,
I discovered this when a few dishonest Buyers contacted me asking for a refund due to lost item , when , in fact their items were delivered in 3-4 days from the order date.,Same situation at this end.  I’ve gone from 100% tracking to 50%.  I pulled out USPS receipts and check 25 of the tracking numbers.  All were accurate.,I would prefer to not get kicked off Amazon.  Any suggestions on how to highlight this issue to Amazon?,My VTR is heading to 0%  ; 100% for years up until 1 week ago --now 40% and no response from Performance  in several days .,I am having the same problem.   My tracking is now at 81.33.   I rechecked all orders for tracking and they are all correct.  Anyone know what has happened with Amazon?   Thank you all.,It’s a guessing game at this time .None of the 3 cases I have opened with A , have an explanation . Ironically, some of the sellers on the forums suggest that the problem is that we are submitting tracking , . Obviously  , something has changed on A’s end and they have not informed FBM sellers.  As I’ve posted,  my VTR was 100% for years up until a week ago and the slide has gone from 82% , 75, 52, 44 …,
Recently, I have noticed this statement , hard to know how it translates in plain English ,When your tracking is flagged as invalid, Amazon does not forward the tracking number to your Buyers.,
Here is what happens , as reported to me from one of my honest customers :,
,
,
So, you can see why I have also received messages from a couple of dis-honest customers trying to get a refund due to their item supposedly lost in transit …,I seem to have the same problem as many sellers now have. My Tracking Numbers are not being documented correctly by Amazon. I have religiously logged my tracking numbers onto each item sold for years now. Suddenly, I am now getting a message from Amazon that my Account is in danger of being suspended for the lack of tracking information. I also have rechecked my orders and all appear fine. I have worked very hard to have my 100% feedback rating and 100% received on time orders and have no desire to lose my account  after doing as Amazon requested…logging in ALL the tracking numbers. What else am I to do? Is Amazon taking notice of this problem? I have yet to see anything that tells folks how to resolve this problem.,Why on earth would AZ kick you off, when they clearly state that having a poor VTR has no penalty?"
Confused with upc,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","Hello I am new to selling on amazon. I am confused with the usage of the upc.,Can I use 1 upc for multiple items?,Can i make my own upc?,What is the best way for going about this?,Any answers are honestly appreciated.Thank you.,No, one ASIN, one GTIN, one product.,Yes, you can. However, this would be pirating it is illegal and Amazon states that they will suspend your new ASIN creation privileges for this and can suspend your selling privileges. This is never a good idea.,You need to either join GS1 US or license an individual GTIN the cost to license a single GTIN is currently $30.00,For additional information please read the following Amazon Policies.,Your product might qualify for a GTIN exemption for more information regarding GTIN exemptions watch this video from Seller University:"
Christmas Eve,"Selling on Amazon,Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns","Will the designation of Christmas eve being a federal holiday include the  Post office not being a available shipping option that day ?,No,So far, USPS has not updated that they will follow it.,thanks for the reply,thanks for the info,My local office will close at Noon on 12-24,I have a bunch of orders that all have a Ship by date of:	Thu, Dec 24, 2020,These are larger and more expensive items that would usually ship by UPS… so how do I avoid wrecking my on time shipment metric, since UPS won’t pickup tomorrow??,Why is Amazon even putting on a ship-by date of 12/24 if you can’t ship that day?,They use the USPS schedule for their ship by days.  I was sure to get any shipments that normally go by UPS that were showing a ship by of tomorrow shipped today.,Check your local store hours tonight; physically take your orders there tomorrow before closing., As a seller it is your responsibility to set your shipping templates up for the correct handling times.  We have ours for 2 days but ship same day until 4:00 EST.,The standard templates has 2 day handling. Orders with a ship by date of December 24th would have been from the 22nd . If you don’t have a pickup on the 24th they needed to go by the 23rd.,It is to late for that now.  Bring them  to a UPS store.,
Consider this a learning experience. Next year make arrangements to get your orders out on time.,We use FedEx and we work with our FedEx contractor to make sure our orders are picked up on time. (We closed on a Monday one week , 2 weeks in advance  we made arrangements for a Sunday pickup so we can get the weekend sales out in a timely manner),Ours closes at 200,
Sfp orders,Amazon had 3 of our orders with a ship by date of 12/25/20 which is a NATIONAL holiday and we shipped these orders/status update on 12/26/20 and have marked these orders as late.,Amazon refuses to change these orders to on time - I hate selling on Amazon and am close to shutting down our store as tired of their b.s."
Is this a scammer? Literally word for word return request from a week ago,Selling on Amazon,"This is literally the word for word transcription I got last week when a customer requested a return. They don’t seem to respond to anything you say in your message. I am gonna report this buyer but is there anything else I should do to flag them to amazon as a scammer or a bot??,Edit: I’m saying that today I got another message that is literally the exact same, making me think the same person is operating multiple accounts OR there is some sort of scammer forum out there that created this template.,Exactly.,OK, so where is this scammer forum? We need to go shut it down, There is a reddit sub where you can hire people to get refunds for you. There are Facebook groups with templates. There are groups sharing “what worked” on SnapChat, TikTok, WhatsApp.,We can’t shut them down, but we can be consistent with applying Amazon’s policies and encourage fellow Sellers to do the same. ,Making the Seller community aware–as you’ve done by posting ,!–is the best strategy for cutting off scammers’ supplies of victims. ,If you are using Amazon buy-shipping just respond with a template directing them to open a claim.,They are trying to bluff/bully you into refunding without them having to open a claim as they are well aware that opening too many non-receipt claims that Amazon has to pay will lead to trouble.,Some of them send this template with just about every order – it has no bearing on whether or not the actual recipient has received the book.,Yes. In the previous message I had used the A-Z template reply I found on here, instructing them on how to request a refund. Then they replied with that scammer reply, so I reported the message, and literally copypasted the exact same A-Z template as my reply to them (lol). Get  ****ed, moron. The last one I won, I’m hoping for another win here. I always use amazon buy shipping and I always ship on time with a scan at the office, but I keep seeing horror stories on here about amazon breaking policies so I always hold my breath,(post withdrawn by author, will be automatically deleted in 24 hours unless flagged),, this Forum is public–please remove that link!

Brand Name change,"Selling on Amazon,Help For New Sellers","Hi guys,I’m new to amazon and I’ve already approved the shippping plan and created the listing,I opted to copy the ASIN of a product already available in the Amazon catalogue however I’m now not able to change the brand name, wouldn’t want to get into any trouble with another seller,What should I do?,Your question has no answer.  You are simply selling a product already listed on the Amazon site.,When you stated you already created a shipping plan, does that mean for FBA?  If so, remember, smart sellers always sell the product FBM first, for 2 reasons.,Hello,Thanks for the response,Yes I’m doing this for FBA, I’ve done the research and it seems like there’s demand for the product so I’m comfortable to give it a go,That is dangerous.  There is a difference between test selling and doing product research.,When you test sell products, get a dozen samples, list them, and see how fast they sell.  See if there is enough profit in them so support the FBA scheme.  Then you can apply your actual results with that FBA hype chart that shows how much better FBA is.,Demand research, valid or not.  There are a lot of software companies and products out there that claim they show you products in demand, but it is necessary to understand how they work.  Some just report selling trends of past purchases.  Using these, there is a lot more not presented, like where the product is in its natural life span.  Some report to to know the next best up coming thing to sell.  Many of these sites, while not known to the user, are basically paid to push a manufacturer’s products, good or bad.  Just keep that in mind, so you really know what you are doing.   ,Understood, thanks for the tip!,Is there any merit to my original concern below?,Did you list your item on someone else’s branded listing ?,Yes, and you could be banned for life, if you proceed with your plan.,You really need to learn the policies on this platform, or you won’t be here ling.,It sounds like you have some generic widget from overseas and listed it on a listing where another seller has added their Brand to the same widget.,You will need to recall the product once it arrives and is process at FBA. Then you can create a new listing, relabel the product and send it back it.,Otherwise, your account could be suspended for fraud (inauthentic), Amazon will keep your product and your $$.,Brand names cannot be changed. New brand name, new ASIN."
Your Unique Address Verification Code,Selling on Amazon,"Where is the Code field in Amazon Seller Central?,where did you get the code from?,Doesn’t the letter have a link?,It’s part of the verification process in some cases.

Where do I put the address verification code? I cannot find the code field?,I did not get an answer. When I signed up for UK and other marketplaces however, I was presented with screens to enter the value from the postcard.,I am having this problem now. Changed my address and could not get into my Seller Central Account until I got my code. I got my code and now the screen to put the code in was not there and just got into Seller Central and my address is the one I want it to be. I cannot find a way to write Amazon directly to ask about this.,Blueberry_Bridges…,There was another thread you might want to search for it was on some page all the way down to the bottom of the right… within the last 7 to 10 days…,Thank you Vespa.

Invoicing for item delivered after buyer was refunded because of nondelivery?,"Selling on Amazon,Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns","A buyer requested a refund for a book because he had not received it after two weeks. I explained that USPS Media Mail was holiday slow, but he still wanted the refund; so I refunded him. Now (a few days later) the book has been delivered. Can I invoice him and get payment for an item that has already been refunded?,No – absolutely not.,In theory the buyer can ask Amazon to be charged again:,Where did you purchase your shipping?, summed it up perfectly.   Never give a refund for items still in transit.   If the customer gets it late and no longer needs it, they can freely return it for a full refund.    If they want to keep the item even though it’s late, it’s up to your discretion if you want to issue any partial refunds to compensate them as a matter of customer service.,As an example, we might be inclined to give them a 10% courtesy adjustment on an order for late delivery, but that all depends on the item in question and how profitable it would be to us.  Every customer situation is different.,Usually, we just reassure them that a full refund can be given once the item is returned if it’s no longer needed, and 99.9% of our customers understand this without any further issue or communication., is correct about the request to recharge. However, the emphatic , needs to be qualified. Legally, you can invoice the customer but you also have to provide them with the option to return it at your expense. The reason for the no is that communications and payments with Amazon customers offsite is a policy violation."
Patent infringers,Selling on Amazon,"is it really that hard to get patent infringers removed?,one of my suppliers sent me this yesterday:,_ _,_ _,_ _,Patents are lame, you can’t search them like you can a trademark. They are too complex for anyone to understand, therefor how can you enforce them on amazon?,Just because you have a patient does not mean the other product is infringing, does it. You would really have to prove that in court, because maybe just maybe their design is a little different.,Of course people always see something similar and go off thinking they have rights to everything. Good luck chasing down people.,you dont know what you are talking about.  this is a clear cut case.,Patents are not a “clear cut case” to Amazon.  Your supplier needs to go after the infringers directly via their lawyer(s).  That is how to protect their patent - not asking Amazon to do it for them.,It’s always “Clear cut” to the patient holder, but if it was so then why amazon don’t enforce?,Between trademark, copyright, patient, counterfeit claims, amazon does not have the resources to enforce or respond. theres just too many complaints. too many.,amazon is quite good at shutting people down at the drop of a hat.   they tend to err on the side of rights/patent owners from what i’ve seen over the past 10 or 11 years.,Thus i am looking for comments from people that have actually dealt with the situation so i can guide my supplier on the best way to proceed.  They are not seasoned Amazon veterans and I can’t do anything because they own the patent.,As noted above, Amazon is the most difficult for them to get help from compared to other venues.,Will Amazon require a letter from a lawyer to close these chinese counterfeiters down?,Amazon does offer an online , form for addressing matters like this.,Unfortunately, the available evidence suggests that this approach is something of a hit-or-miss operation, perhaps as a result of either:,For this reason, many ROs simply cut through the red-tape by having their legal representation send a Demand Letter, via Certified Mail, directly to the Amazon OGC (“Office of The General Counsel”), and/or to its national registered agent, Corporation Service Company (CSC), as explained in the Seller Help Content’s ,.,As our friend We Sell Stuff states, the real key in enforcing IPR the engagement of competent legal representation; the available evidence suggests that once an RO is on Amazon’s radar by having successfully brought its attention to its possible liability, infringement instances tend to wither away.,Enforcement of patents, trademarks and copyrights are the responsibility of the rights holder.,Amazon’s sole interest in IP rights is to protect itself from being dragged into an infringement suit triggered by a seller.,Do it yourself attempts at enforcing IP rights are not taken as seriously as actions by lawyers. The reason is obvious. IP rights enforcement by Amazon sellers is muddied by the Business Services Agreement.,Having the rights owned by an entity which is not an Amazon seller, and using an attorney gets better results more often.,Just the cynical observations of an aging businessman."
Order doesn't qualify for Safe T Claim,Selling on Amazon,"Can someone please tell me how I can get my item returned since AMZ auto-refunded this customer?,

Only Seller Fulfilled Prime orders, MFN Prepaid Return Label orders, Easy Ship orders and VAS orders, are eligible for SAFE-T claims. Please refer to Amazon SAFE-T Claim Policy for more details,I do ALL of my labels thru Amazon & they told me if I do my labels I should be able to file a claim; but apparently it doesn’t work for some reason. What are MFN prepaid Return labels?,Thank you,
Craig,Can you document that you shipped ‘on time’. i.e. what is the origin scan date and time from the carrier tracking information?,SAFE-T claims are contingent on the on-time shipment. If your carrier accepted the package but did NOT scan it until much later, then you have no claim with Amazon and must pursue your carrier.,Since you did not provide really any info, we have to guess. Did you lose an A2Z claim for INR (Item Not Received)? If so, you cannot file a SafeT on an order with an A2Z. You need to appeal the A2Z.,There are a few templates on the forum for this. But you must have shipped on time and be able to prove it with tracking."

"What happened to the ""advanced search"" link in books?","Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","I use it to research book prices and it’s not there anymore…? I can find it if I google “amazon books advanced search” but the button on the site seems to have vanished.,Just bookmark the page for future use. There have been several threads about this. Open a case if you wish.,Huh, I haven’t seen any threads about it (but I believe you, of course). Not only is it a drag for researching books but I feel like it’s hampering customers’ ability to search for a particular edition, etc.,So is it just a glitch or what? Is it coming back?,It is not a glitch. It is deliberate, but who knows if permanent.,This will be interpreted by many as Amazon’s utter contempt for book buyers, book sellers, and books as well.,Here’s my thread.  I hope you will start complaining (open a case) as well.,I’m complaining from the buyer side as well. I buy many 3P books through Amazon. I buy NO books directly from Amazon anymore.,Yes, I think complaining as a customer is a better idea. I’m doing it now.,Yes. Do both. We are buyers as well as sellers,This makes no sense at all. Why on earth would customers not want to be able to narrow their search results? To the point where the link actually has to be removed so it’s not possible? I don’t understand the reasoning on this. Hopefully enough people complain about it so it’s brought back but I can’t figure out why they’d remove it in the first place.,I spent half an hour on a chat with Buyer customer service. They told me to use the filters on the side of the page. I pointed out that name of publisher and date of publication are not there. And the process is more cumbersome that way. And repeat customers like me who buy a lot of books would like the Advanced Search page to use as we always have. (I really have bought a lot of used books on Amazon, and they can see your account.) I also asked them to pass my displeasure along as feedback. They gave me a $5 credit to spend on an Amazon product.,Good, hopefully a lot of people will do what you did. Enjoy your $5 credit, lol.,Which shows they didn’t understand at all.,Those are two completely separate processes.  Those filters they talk about are for looking through and possibly refining the OFFERS.,We are talking about searching for the detail page.,One has absolutely nothing to do with the other, and the types of refinements are not at all the same.,Yeah. Let’s ALL go get our $5 credits now! Calling all friends and family now until advanced search reappears. Joking. Joking…really,I think you should call them weekly.

My suspicion is that they have made their own product, and sent it to FBA claiming that it is my product.  I have submitted two different cases to Amazon and all they do is send me back a pre-filled form and claiming that they have resolved the issue.

ARS-technica writes an article about Amazon and the reviews manipulation,Selling on Amazon,"The 2 funny parts are:,The last thread on this Amazon said they can’t stop this from happening, but I find that rubbish. This is their platform and I am on email with support almost everyday for meaningless things that take forever to change, but some guy can simply upload a template and take over listings without any issues…,Moderator Edit (Ricardo_Mod_Amazon):  removed external URL.,Thanks for the heads up.,
The one issue is the lack of transparency for the sellers. As you may remember, big threads about the new policy of putting names and locations for sellers in our profiles.,
As these are easily searchable many sellers are justifiably upset.,
So all the names of those drone people seemed to be from Asian extraction, possibly PRC.,
So I wonder again if the rules are different for US based sellers compared to off shore?,
Seems as such is the case.,Ya, i don’t like to really use ‘chinese seller’ and such that often get used in this forum as there are plenty of US bad actors causing issues.,
But it does seem when Amazon hooked up with these Chinese manufactures and did all this partnering that they do seem to play by different rules.,
this review manipulation is completely out of hand,What is most disappointing in the piece - but not surprising to us - is that ,.,The issue, of course, is that Amazon allows some sellers to steal pages with good reviews.  Yet an Amazon spokesperson replied:,It is not a page-grouping problem.  It is a page-theft problem.,As the Ars Technica author, Timothy B. Lee, writes:,I guess you mean like a simple program to check for words matching? Honey = Drone. not,Amazon probably did not even need to do that.  Surely the seller of honey complained to Amazon.,Amazon does not even need to actively hunt for page theft.  Just respect the complaints that come from sellers about page theft.,True but I was thinking of pages that had not been used for awhile.,
Some have moved on and the listings are Amazon listings so they do not go away unless they turn into dog pages.,they figured out a way to find out every listing related to pesticides and made us all take a course and they figured out how to not pay tax, soooooo I think they could figure something out,Agreed yet as , has pointed out this is a current issue and is not being addressed even as one of the three was addressed but not the other two.,

There is too much sheer incompetence to go around.,OK. seriously, when a member of the jeff@amazon “team” actually LIES to me about having contacted a company regarding nearly 40 messed up titles and gets caught for NOT doing that it doesn’t take a bribe.,There is a problem with Amazon having so many “firewalls” and too much compartmentalization.  It creates a near total LACK of communication and responsibility on the part of the individual.  If you can’t get called out by another department that MIGHT actually KNOW something you can spew as much crap as you want to with no repercussions at all.,As long as Amazon insists on building walls to deter communication (and solutions) it will eventually be buried in the debris and, sadly, that will take down thousands upon thousands of sellers as well.  A massive implosion the size of this one will leave few survivors.,The title of this article is: Amazon still hasn’t fixed its problem with bait-and-switch reviews (for those looking for it).,I know it’s not appropriate to say this but I’ll say it anyway. I know a “friend of a friend” who writes reviews for listings. It’s like this:,A review for honey: The honey was thick and the taste are better than other brands.,The manager will take this and change a few words.,Newly updated review: The drone was high quality and flies better than other brands.,Then do this for thousands of reviews. All written on the excel file. Everything “automated”. The fake reviews can be written by 1 or 10 people, it really doesn’t matter, but, rather that Amazon can’t do anything about it, because it’s all real purchases.,So here you guys go. This is done on a global scale by Chinese manufacturers distributors or whoever. Try and stop them. They’ll just make a new listing and do the same thing with reviews. As if taking down mattered to them? Nah. Unless you ban their corporation, but, that’s on a whole new level. Then again, they can just incorporate a new company, make a new brand, make a new listing, and write reviews. So yeah good luck.,This was my friend’s friend’s experiences.

I already ask the carrier and it says that the item was not there, I also ask amazon and asking for a refund but I cannot get a proper answer where could be the item. Is there anyone help me with this? Thank you so much,If the carrier cannot locate the package, you need to file an insurance claim."
"Wants refund for INR, stuck in Philly",Selling on Amazon,"Dec 31, 2020 9:52 AM,

Hi Danielle.  your order is in Philadelphia.  The major shipping crisis due to Covid has hit Philadelphia particularly hard. The USPS states that the backlog is a million plus packages but they are working hard to get them delivered.  When you do receive your order if you no longer want it please return for a full refund.  Thank you, Di,

I don’t believe there even is such a product in the mail,
There was only 1 on the whole amazon site , my friend and I each ordered it with out the other knowing,
And know we both know we both ordered this 1 item from same seller and there was only 1 air freshener to begin with, how is this possible?,
And neither of us received it yet,
How is this?,
Please credit me — customer wants a refund for item that is stuck at USPS Philly facility.,You may want to read through the 5-10 posts a day about this same issue.,It.s just getting so old. I already have Canadian customer put in an A-Z claim for item received late. It.s just a losing game.,Though I don’t sell in the Amazon Canada marketplace anymore, I do ship to Canada elsewhere. Everything going to Canada, since early December, is stuck after being processed in Chicago. If you have not done so, I would put the Amazon Canada marketplace on vacation for the time being.,Getting back to your original issue… Did you use an Amazon label and ship on time? By ship on time, I mean was the , scanned on or before the ship by date for the order? If so, then this should be covered by Amazon’s Buy Shipping INR policy. If it is, I would direct the buyer to contact Amazon to open an INR A-Z claim."

Of course, I don’t have that info because it is an FBA shipment and payment is in ‘pending’ status.,
Here is how I handled the situation.,I don’t want to project but I am sure he will keep the book as well. ,Wait, you refunded the order?,Why would you do that?,And how could you do that if it was still pending?,Your first and only answer should have been that shipping is being handled by Amazon, please contact them directly about your order.,If you issue a refund, you messed up.

They would rather give irrelevant answers and pretend that they solved the issue, rather than passing it on to someone who can solve the issue.,The purpose of Seller Support, at any organization, is to provide A to Z support (pun intended).,In Scamazon’s case, the Pro fee includes this Support (it is Scamazon’s Selling Point to get more Sellers to Go Pro (pun intended)).  And this Support is now in a very Sorry State.,If Scamazon’s systems were better, the need for such Support would diminish considerably.

i disputed it , and they still decide to keep thire original decision , even wen its clearly a wrong decision,
my question is what are my options ? and if there is anywhere in amazon policies that stating that we should be covered on this , that i can open a new case,Thank You,Welcome to our world.,on all the forums it says that amazon should cover it , can someone direct me to the link , that i can send it to them , since its really unfair,I’m having the same issue as yours.,Amazon just fund the amount to the customer by amazon selves. without any notifications.,Who gonna pay for our loss??  after the customer received the product and not able to return the product back the seller?,So as a seller, we have to take a full responsibility for the loss and negative feedback and everything.,Amazon just not doing anything.,If tracking shows that you shipped on time, open an appeal.,If you bought the shipping through Amazon, shipped on time, and have a carrier scan showing it was picked up on time, then open an appeal.

Thank You for the note , this is the 2nd case that they took the money out of my account,

I filled in an automated help workflow, and received the following response (see below). Since I’m pretty new to this, is it typical expect to wait 2 month for new inventory to be processed and available? I’m assuming my next steps are to sit back and wait and not bother trying to send a secondary inventory update to the FBA facility…?,Missing inbound FBA inventory,Note: You may experience longer than usual shipment delivery time due to higher volume of shipments.

experiencing is pretty normal depending on the time of year,

Than it was lost and we were paid a compensation a 30% or so of sale price.,
It was definitely below  pre tax net we would receive if items will be sold.,
There is always a risk or so called “cost of business” present in the operation.,
So, we are shipping a smaller batches now to spread the risk.,We have had a shipment or 2 “lost”,out of a thousands, in 7 years.,We were eventually compensated the same as if we had sold the items on the site.,
We recovered our cost and our margin exactly the same as selling them.,These items had sales history for Amazon to use to calculate the reimbursement.,
New products may not have this advantage.,One of our “lost” shipments was eventually “found”.,
We were debited back the exact same amount we had been reimbursed months earlier."

There are 7 different Chinese sellers and NONE of them has a single unverified review.,All non-Chinese sellers with significant sales ALL have 1-Star unverified negative reviews.,Amazon- Please disallow all unverified reviews.  Your system is being abused and not allowing unverified reviews seems like it would be an easy fix.,At the very least require unverified reviews to have met a significant minimum threshold.  Such as 20 real purchases, account older than 3 months.  This would not stop this from happening but it would help."
Method of payment,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","Hey guys, I am new in Amazon. I have a question, is it better to use Pay By Invoice or Get Paid Faster?  I am trying to learn many terms around here and though some seem to be straight forward one can’t help to have doubts about which one would be the best decision.,It is best to get used to the Amazon payment schedule you have been given.,If you chose “Get Paid Faster” you lose about 1.5% of your money. (Amazon fee),
“Pay By Invoice” gives you 100% of your money but you may have to wait for 30 days to receive it.,
The above only applies to “Invoice” sales however.,
For most sellers they receive very few “Invoice” sales unless they are selling higher priced items or have a lot of business sales.,I am not familiar with this.  Obviously this must be something different from the “request payment” button that some accounts have?,All of this pertains to “Invoiced” orders where there is a ""Get Paid Faster’ option.,
Has nothing to do with regular payment disbursements or any “Request” payment button.,Ah – gotcha.,Thanks."
Need help with a return,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","I’ve been going in circles through Amazon help, and can’t quite figure this out.,A customer purchased a book in November, and now wants to return it as “No Longer Needed”. By my understanding, the customer is responsible for the return shipping cost; but everything I’ve found in reference to this concerns withholding the cost from the refund.,
However, when I go to 'Manage Returns"", I’m given two options: Have Amazon issue an un-paid label, or upload a pre-paid label.,Logic tells me that if I select the unpaid label, then everything is covered; but I also know that logic does not always apply with Amazon. This is my first return of this type, and what I’ve found in the help files seems to sometimes contradict itself.,
Is selecting ""Unpaid’ label and letting the customer know that they have to buy postage the right way to proceed? I’ll also let them know that there will be no restocking fee as long as the book is still in the same condition.,There is no need to contact the buyer at all.,
You approve the return request with the Amazon provided unpaid label. PERIOD,Before Amazon prepaid labels for pro-sellers, we always sent a prepaid label. It makes it easier for the buyer as there is no need to stand in line at the Post Office and we control how it is returned.,Thanks. I sent the unpaid label."
Advanced Search is suddenly gone - Am I missing something?,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","Hallelujah.   Please, dear Amazon, put this in your permanent file of bad ideas.  I really hope they were just playing around with it.  Wouldn’t it be nice if they actually made it work better.,In another thread on this topic, Rushdie posted a link to the Advanced Search for Kindle.,I was not aware of that page, so possibly it is new and the link for Advanced Search for books was temporarily removed while they tinkered with that.,On this thread , I wrote this:,I spent half an hour on a chat with Buyer customer service. They told me to use the filters on the side of the page. I pointed out that name of publisher and date of publication are not there. And the process is more cumbersome that way. And repeat customers like me who buy a lot of books would like the Advanced Search page to use as we always have. (I really have bought a lot of used books on Amazon, and they can see your account.) I also asked them to pass my displeasure along as feedback. They gave me a $5 credit to spend on an Amazon product.,…Maybe it helped.,Apples and oranges anyway.,Those two searches are for different purposes and used in different places.,Advanced Search for books is searching for product detail pages.,The search the Seller Support rep was talking about is a refinement of offerings.,Apples and oranges."
Advanced Search is suddenly gone - Am I missing something?,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","Is anyone else missing “Advanced Search” on the main Amazon Books page?,I have cleared my cache, reset my modem, tried different browsers - everything I can think of.  No Advanced Search shows.  I use it a lot.,
,It’s usually under the main bar along with the New releases, Best Sellers & More.,Anywhere else I can access an advanced search feature?,Just bookmark a link:,Thank you.  Thank you.  I knew someone would have a solution.,It has to be a glitch, right?,Wouldn’t hurt to offer a suggestion (open a case).,So I opened a case.  I was so hoping this would be a case where someone would actually read my message and look at the screen shot.  I wrote -,and attached the following screenshot -,
,This is what I got back -,Another case in the non-responsive file.   Big sigh.,That is so typical.,When trying to convince them of a site-wide issue they always insist on an example. If you provide an example, they pretend the issue is only about that one example.,I complained about this, twice, a couple of days ago. Finally got this reply:,Greetings from Amazon Seller Support,,From your case I understand you’re inquiring about not being able to see the Advanced Search under the Books page.,Any changes made under the main Amazon website are handle by our Website Team and tested with Customers directly, so all changes made on the Amazon website can not be undone or change by us or the seller.,Note: be aware that not all changes made on the website are permanent, as it depends on Customers response to this changes.,I complained again to them & they said they were passing along my comment to the “website team”.,
I strongly urge everyone here to “respond” to the “change”. This is very bad if you sell books that people look up by title & author. The general search always turns up a lot of completely irrelevant results. Another inexplicable change from the web design idiots, which can only result in fewer sales.,That at least indicates they read and understood – so way ahead of the curve for typical support.,I sent a reply to seller support and got this reply -,Can anyone see advanced search on the left side?  I can’t.  I have sent another reply saying so.,I will say I can still find advanced search on google.  I’m guessing that’s where bookwormapril found the link she sent earlier.  Thank you again.,Let’s do a suppose.  Let’s say I have a 1934 edition of Tom Sawyer from Classic’s Publishing.  How on earth am I supposed to find that particular edition without advanced search.,I think I will reach out to some friends and relatives who regularly buy books on Amazon and ask them to complain.,Thank you, I use this all the time too!,Advanced Search was kicked from Amazon UK about two months ago. New it would come soon to , .,Thing is that Amazon does not want to sell old books. They are rapidly erasing old books. Increasingly it will only be ISBNs selling.,BookScene,Combinola, no, it’s not there, just the words Advanced Search that is no longer an operable button. This is typical seller support.,I’m not really optimistic about complaining about this. We still have those stupid sliding pages, in spite of massive objections and no discernable benefit.,I’ve had it on my bookmark toolbar at top screen for years.,Just got a notice that my case has been forwarded to another team.  I hope it’s not the black hole team.,I am SO glad you posted that. I use the Advanced Search feature all the time when listing old/rare books. It is indispensable for me. Thank you!!!,Ditto, there but not operable.,I don’t miss that feature…lol quit selling books many years ago…,Hey, guess what? It’s back!!!,Yay!,But just in case, best to bookmark this … this is a much cleaner version of the link I posted previously. (courtesy of Dogtamer)"
Advanced Search in books... revisited,"Selling on Amazon,General Selling Questions","I have been posting a link in various threads.,It was pointed out this morning that the link no longer works.,So it does seem that Advanced Search in books was murdered, not just lost.,Please – all of you who use this essential tool, let Amazon know about it. How important it is.,This is the link that worked for me for years.,No longer.,Looks like another Amazon push in a convenient direction for them:,Okay.,Now I am really mad.,I was looking around for some way to help the book sellers to locate a way to evaluate your books. Under the Abe books link on Amazon, this page has an Advanced Search.,
I don’t know if looking for pricing is what you use Amazon’s deleted Advanced Search for, but for those looking to price, try here: ,If you are looking for an old ASIN number, I cannot find any way to do this on the Amazon site that will take you to it, other than to do a title search. But… therein lies part of the problem with Amazon books sellers who change up, add unnecessary information into the title, or re-arrange the title to try to make their listing their own.,Best of luck, all,I’m contacting a few senior executives I know  at Amazon to try and convince them to bring it back.  They removed it so they would have more control over what to present buyers, but I do not think they understand what that does to sellers. I’ve been telling sellers for 15+ years to use this page to find the correct ASIN/ISBN to list products on Amazon.,To all:,Try this link:,I was just getting ready to post the ‘simplified’ version of that URL, but you beat me by a minute:,The main reason to use Advanced Search on Amazon is to locate the ASIN you need to list non-ISBN books.,It is very unusual not to already have a detail page. Many are older pages, suppressed to a normal search. Advanced Search, using Year “forces” those pages to show in a search.,I think most booksellers know about ABE advanced search – ever so much better as a real search.,But thank you.,Thank you Dogtamer, that’s cleaner. I’ll edit my new bookmark.,And, just for laughs, here’s my case:,Your message to us:,And the “answer”:,I sometimes use Addall to research books.  It shows books listed across different venues along with the prices right on the first page.,(post withdrawn by author, will be automatically deleted in 24 hours unless flagged),What would we do without you?! ,Not have to spend time trying to decipher the meaning of whichever (often rather obscure) “Word of The Day” I’ve chosen to work into my posts? ,Seriously, though, I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my position in this regard:,My all-too meager efforts to help others in our Seller Community are offered because I have no doubt that I owe an LARGE debt of gratitude to the freely-proffered advice of seasoned, savvy forum veterans like you, Rush (and April, and , , others) - I simply stand upon the shoulders of giants.,That debt is likely to prove an unpayable sum, e`en should I find myself blessed to be able to attempt paying it forward for the next two decades - but I’ll keep on truckin’ along that path until I go home…,May You and Yours, and all of the rest of us on this mortal coil, enjoy brighter days in the New Year!,All of us are standing on the shoulders of those who came before us. It’s all in the research!,No problem deciphering your posts, but I do worry about ,, as you already know! ,Indeed we shall:,
,Wishing you and yours a very blessed and happy New Year and a fond “good riddance” to 2020.,Ooh - the button on the books page is back! , It’s a New Year’s miracle, 2021 is shaping up to be a better year already ,Bookfinder is another way to unearth those hard to find pages, at least if they have offers on them.   I’ve had books show up searching there that I couldn’t find via advanced search.  Bonus is that it shows the results from all the international Amazon pages in addition to a handful of other sites to give more pricing data.,Yes it’s back! Hope it stays. Happy gone year!"
