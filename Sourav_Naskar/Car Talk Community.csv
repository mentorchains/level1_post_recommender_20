0,Cooling System Stop Leak hot engine?,Maintenance/Repairs,9,317,"Hi there, I have some small leaks in my cooling system, so I ordered the Wynn’s Cooling System Stop Leak product (https://www.wynns.eu/product/cooling-system-stop-leak/ 1). It says on that website I should bring the engine up to temperature and then pour the liquid into the cooling system via the radiator cap. However, I am always told you should never ever ever open the radiator cap while the engine is hot, let alone running. Am I reading something wrong or should I really do that?
Thanks…

Leave the radiator cap off while you run the engine.  For a short time you will be fine.


These miracle in a jug fixes may or may not work.    Even if this stuff works it may fail in short order. Can you locate and fix the leak?

Alright, so take the cap of before starting the engine, wait a few minutes until it gets warm, pour the stuff in, put the cap back on, let the engine run a few minutes and that’s it?
It is not one clear leak, but various small leaks i suppose, because the leaking coolant (though not dripping or flowing, just a bit wet) can be seen in multiple places under the engine and drive shaft.Yes, you want the coolant circulating when you pour in the stop leak, it must be poured into the radiator directly, not into the overflow/reservoir tank.
After adding, run it more than just a few minutes.  Take it out and drive at highway speeds.  You need to get it well circulated throughout the entire cooling system.
As noted it might work, on the other hand it may clog some passages.I’ll try that, thanks! We’ll see if it works.It might just be one leak, and then as you drive the air movement sprays it all over. Before you add the stop leak, get the engine up to temperature and pop the hood. See if you can see steam and if so, where it’s coming from. It would be a shame to potentially gunk up passages with stop leak if you only needed to replace a heater hose.I agree with shadowfax. This product is a last-ditch attempt to be used only when a proper fix can’t be done for some reason.Can you see the leaks?  Do you suspect that it could be the head gasket?  If you think it is the head gasket, I would suggest that you use the Subaru cooling system conditioner.  I’ve used it but it only works if the leak is very small.  It does not clog passages but I don’t know if it will work on leaks other than head gaskets.Stopleaks work quite well on radiator tube punctures,not on radiator seam, rubber hose or gasket leaks.Alright, I’ll have a thorough look at everything when’re engine is up to temperature. Thanks for your comments.",,,,
1,Coolant System Bubble Removal Procedure,Maintenance/Repairs,1,40,"Hi I have a quick question. I have to use specially formulated BMW coolant (the blue stuff, I think ammonia nitrate free or something like that?) for my 2002 BMW 330 Ci. In the instructions on the coolant bottle it says after adding coolant you have to run the car with the overflow reservoir cap off and the heat blasting at full until the car reaches normal operating temperature to remove bubbles from the coolant system. This prevents later overheating. My friend said I don’t need to do this unless I open the coolant system up. What’s the verdict? Is it necessary or unnecessary when just adding coolant to the system? Thanks!When all else fails follow the directions.Also, as they appear in the coolant reservoir you have to pop the bubbles or else they will circulate back into the system. I think BMW makes a special tool for this, kind of expensive, but well worth it.  
But seriously the air bubbles need to be purged out. Don’t listen to that friend. Can he afford to buy you a new engine, when yours overheats and destroys itself?",,,,
2,Expensive Volvo Repair,General Discussion,61,1.3k,"To reinforce the advice so many here give about buying used European vehicles .  Most of the time it is that it would be best to avoid if you can’t afford the repairs.
Our 2010 Volvo V10 is in the dealer shop because the rear lift gate will not stay open  .  The parts are going to take 3 or 4 days to arrive and they say at least one whole day to replace the gas struts that are hidden by the headliner.  The estimate is 1300.00 to 1400.00 .
While we would not really care to spend this amount but we bought it new and this is the first repair other then normal service.  Just think how someone on a budget would feel if they had this problem plus vehicle payments.A friend of mine had a Volvo once. It cost a minimum of about $500 every time it went to the shop, and it was in the shop a lot.
No thanks.While many sources discuss car reliability, I find it difficult to find sources that discuss the actual costs. So, I hear rumors that Volvo, Subaru, Audi, BMW etc etc are expensive to own, I never see any data. Can anybody recommend a good source of actual $$?1300-14,000$?
I assume it’s 1400. You really need struts?Whoops , one too many zero’s . Thanks Cavell it has been edited.I am almost at the point where if one gets a repair done on a car for less than $1000, one probably got off cheap.
I had to have a water pump replaced on the 2011 Toyota Sienna I owned.  The cost was $975.  The heater blower is beginning to make a screeching noise on my 2017 Sienna.  I looked online as to how to make the repair.  It wouldn’t be that difficult except that I can’t do the contortions to get under the dashboard, so when it gets too annoying, I’ll have to bite the bullet and pay for the repair
I had to replace the blower motor a couple of times in my 1978 Oldsmobile Cutlass.  It wss under the hood and a 15 minute job I did myself.  The heater core was under the hood and I replaced it in about an hour.  I was able to replace the water pump on the Oldsmobile in about three hours.  Spark plugs were easy to access.
My point is that I am not sure that European makes today are any worse as far as cost of repairs as any other vehicles on the market.good info, @VOLVO-V70Meh, I don’t think this is as gloom and doom as you make it out to be. I own a 2018 XC60, it comes down to having a lifecycle cost mentality. You’re saying this car is 10 years old and has required one $1400 repair. $1400 in repairs over 10 years is nothing…now if it was $1400 every year, that’s another conversation.
I guess it comes down to personal preference…for me, I would gladly (and I have) taken a vehicle whose major systems are highly reliable (generally), at the cost of a few weird/expensive accessories and electronics. After all, you always have the option not to repair the struts, the same could not necessarily be said of engine/transmission/suspension work.


 VOLVO-V70:

The estimate is 1300.00 to 1400.00 .


Wow. I never found non-hidden hatch struts to be ugly, and they mean I pay about 20 or 30 bucks to replace them in around 5 minutes.

About a year ago I sold a 2007 Acura TL. I’d spent less than $3,000, including the mandatory timing belt job that was over $1,000, to keep it on the road in all the years I owned it, and I bought it off-lease in 2008. The most expensive repair I had to do on it was right at the end when I snapped an axle that had gotten rusty under the rubber vibration dampener. That cost around $400 to do it myself, only about 2/3rds of which was the part (I had to buy a few tools). Would’ve been somewhere around $1500 to have it done at a shop.
Meanwhile a friend of mine used to drive an Audi S4. At the time he worked for a chain of gas stations managing their IT needs, and one of the perqs of the job was free gas. Even with that, he ended up selling the Audi because it was draining his wallet so fast in repairs that the free gas didn’t make up for it. He ended up in a Japanese car and was amazed at how much less he was spending to keep it on the road.
Now, I know that personal anecdotes only represent single points of data, but there are a lot of those anecdotes out there both on the Euro car expense and the relative frugality of owning cars from other continents. As another anecdote, my mom managed to spend more on the BMW she owned for 3 years, despite it being under warranty (because somehow the problems were always diagnosed as being non-covered repairs), than I did in the whole time I owned the Acura.



 BikeGuy88:

$1400 in repairs over 10 years is nothing


You’re right, but $1,400 to fix a problem that costs less than dinner for 2 at a chain restaurant on most other cars is, you’ll surely admit, a bit up there.


 oldnotdeadyet:

I find it difficult to find sources that discuss the actual costs.


Here you go!..
https://www.edmunds.com/tco.html 4
I ran the analysis between my 2014 Audi A4 Quattro and a 2014 Honda Accord V6
Maintenance over 5 years  Audi - $6527  Honda $5414
Repairs over 5 years   Audi $7156 (!!)   Honda $2470
Maintenance is scheduled and estimated unscheduled. Repairs are the estimated costs NOT covered by warranty. Insurance and depreciation was a bit higher for the Audi.
Clearly the Euro cars costs more to own. $5800 more just to keep 'er running in this comparison.My personal yardstick for any car is I only want one where I can get the oil changed at Walmart.
If I have to take it to a dealer and/or out of my local town for maintenance, that’s not the car for me.@shadowfax.  I have never owned a car with a European nameplate.  My experience with minivans, which includes a 1990 Ford Aerostar, a 2000 Ford Windstar, a 2006 Chevrolet Uplander, a 2011 Toyota Sienna and a 2017 Toyota Sienna is that the repair expenses were about equal on all of them.
I live in a university town.  There are no longer dealers for European cars.  We can’t keep a VW dealership.  The only Asian dealerships are Toyota and Honda. The Mazda dealer, the Subaru dealer and the Nissan dealer are long gone.  Maybe this says something about the reliability of different makes.   Before I retired, I had colleagues with BMW and Mercedes Benz cars. The nearest dealers for these products is 55 miles away.
For me, time was money before I retired.  My time was too valuable to spend a half day or more with car servicing and repair. I was happy driving my Ford Maverick that rode like a wheelbarrow and had an interior that made a school bus seem luxurious, than wasting time having to drive 55 miles each way for car repairs.  Maybe European makes do require more repairs.


 Triedaq:

I was happy driving my Ford Maverick


You’re a very tolerant guy. My grandma had a Maverick. She hated coming to our house in it because we lived at the top of a mountain and that thing could barely wheeze its way up to our neighborhood.The Edmunds link is very useful.  However, I am a believer in keeping a car about 15 years, so I am looking for the 5-15 year data also. I am particularly interested in knowing about repairs such as the Volvo hatchback supports. That is, will my car have a lot of $1000 repairs for parts that ought to cost $40.
I will also read a car’s maintenance schedule to see if there are significant items that I cannot do, and try to see if the car has proprietary parts that cost a fortune.  Of course, all this data is hard to find.@shadowfax.  My Ford Maverick had the 250 cu in 6 engine and had reasonable power.  I bought the Maverick as a used vehicle and initially I was using a quart of oil every 300 miles.  I had the valve stem seals replaced–I think the cost back then was less than $50.  The garage didn’t pull the cylinder head.  The mechanic had an adapter that fit the spark plug hole.  He injected air into the cylinder to keep the valve from dropping down, removed the keeper and valve spring, put in a new seal and moved on to the next cylinder.  After the repair, I got about 1300 miles per quart of oil, while not great, was acceptable to me.
The biggest expense I had was for Preparation-H that I used because of the wheelbarrow ride and Blue Cross wouldn’t pay for Preparation-H.I think we’re all doing apples and oranges comparisons here. If you want to keep a car for 15 years and the idea of $1000 plus repairs for noncritical systems scares you, then any luxury brand…not just Volvo, is likely not for you. Similarly, if the dealership is 50+ miles away, the brand may not be for you; as for time being money, most of the luxury brands (including Volvo) have a service where they will bring you a loaner car and take your car off to repair.
Personally, I drive a Volvo because of the company’s long commitment to safety, the looks of the vehicle, some of the winter weather features (e.g., all touchscreens work with gloves, since people in Sweden pretty much have wear them all year lol), and the value that I personally get in being able to drive something unique in the road (I live in Detroit, and everyone and their dog is driving a Caddy, Lincoln, or Buick). But I’m also okay with paying for $1400 windshield replacements (due to integrated heads up display and some other stuff) and, I guess, liftgate struts (assuming it wasn’t more than once a decade).
I think the conversation on European cars being more expensive to own only touches on part of the question. Yes, they are often more expensive to fix. But what about the value provided by the vehicle? Within budget constraints, someone who perceives a vehicle as having 2x the value of another should be okay with paying 2x as much for repairs, all else equal.I always thought that for inexpensive repairs, s 1958 Studebaker Scotsman would be a good car for long road trips and a King Midget would be a a good around town car.As long as you never, ever, ever get in a crash.


 BikeGuy88:

Key point, and I agree. You own a Volvo and find the costs acceptable just as I own an Audi and also find the costs acceptable. But I wouldn’t recommend someone spend their entire car buying budget buying a 10 year old Volvo or Audi.
But the questions we get asked here are from people who are thinking of buying a cheap used Euro car because they believe they are more durable and somehow that creates a low cost of ownership. Clearly, it does not.
I will often comment… A cheap Abcxyz (pick your least favorite Euro brand) is the most expensive car you’ll ever own.  And I’ll repeat that to the next poster who wants to buy a 15 year old BMW, Mercedes or Volvo with 160,000 miles. The data bears this out.The engineer in me can still apply that to my original value vs. cost logic, haha
At the point that the cost of repairs is actively causing you stress – as it might be with someone who has a lower budget – then you have to start adding that stress to the cost side of the equation. At some point, those costs (actual + i dunno, psychological) will outweigh the benefits/value…and then at that point, no, you should not be owning that car.",,,,
3,2005 Ford Taurus - Will 6’ 10” fit?,Maintenance/Repairs,20,414,"I need to know if a 2005 Taurus SE has enough head and legroom for my 6’10"" teenager.First you find a 2005 Taurus SE , then you take the teenager to the vehicle and have it get in the vehicle.Thanks for that advice. I was hoping to surprise him.My dad’s more like 5’11"" with along torso and he found that car less comfortable to get in and out of then the same vintage Ford Focus he’d rented to do the same 120mi round trip. How similar in size is it to the other cars in the family fleet?I’m jealous.  But there’s a couple things you never buy for someone else.  One is a dog and another is a car.  Why not just give a coupon you make up for a car and let him choose?

Here is SNL’s version of a Lexus Christmas commercial:

Do you know anyone else that tall that could do the sit test for you?  Your son’s height is unusual enough that you probably should tell him you are giving him a car and then go shopping together.I just can’t see a teenager being thrilled about a 2005 Taurus as a surprise gift .My teens weren’t thrilled with the ten year old Buick Regal when I gave it to them, but they sure were happy to have a car, even that one.Impossible to tell if they will fit. Not all people are built the same.
I’m 6’3 and have a friend who’s 5’11. When we sit down his head is about 2"" higher then mine.Best to let him sit in the car first before you buy.  He will fit, but whether it will be a comfortable fit is another question.  At 6-6, this is a big deal with me on picking a vehicle.  Your son at 6-10 will obviously have even more potential issues with any vehicle.That’s just mean.

Apparently you have forgotten being a teenager .I remember NOT being a self-entitled rich kid.Something in the back of my mind made me look here:

It earned the CarComplaints “Avoid Like the Plague” award.  I would!That is actually VERY helpful. Thanks so much, texases!


 CrickleB:

That’s just mean. 


So like they say, do you want the truth or would you rather be lied to?
I gave my son one of my beloved Rivieras.  Sure he liked it but it wasn’t too long that he was picking out his own car and I got it back.Consumer reports listed cars for tall people. Their tall person was 6’ 2"". None of the cars were domestic. The Honda Pilot was one of them. You might get a Lincoln or a Crown Victoria to work somewhat.A long time ago I owned a first generation Sable and I can say that car was somewhat roomy with the front seat back but I’m nowhere near 6’10"". All I can suggest is have him give it a try and see what happens.
Given a choice of a 2005 Taurus or the first car I ever owned I’d take the Taurus in a heartbeat. My first car was a 1958 Thunderbird with a 352 in it
It seemed ok at first (they always do) but after a month the horrible realization had fully set in that the 4 wheeled garden slug did not have one redeeming feature at all and it was soon sent packing.
I’ve owned many cars and never regretted any of them…except that TxxdBird.",,,,

5,2000 Chevy express 1500 350 intake manifold leak,General Discussion,3,87,"Can anyone tell me if a 2000 Chevy express 1500 350 intake manifold leak is common?  I was just told I needed a water pump.  So I had it changed. I noticed I was still leaking antifreeze.  They  now tell me it is the manifold gasket.  I though these people were trustworthy. First there is no way to tell if the water pump was bad and second they tell me that the leak is common on these cars.  Is this true?  Any info would be great.Leaks are common on EVERY 20 year old vehicle regardless of manufacturer.
Yeah, Gen 1 350 Chevys can leak from the intake but usually it leaks into the engine to the lifter galleries.Agreed with Mustangman. It’s 20 years old and this could also be one of those weak link in the chain scenarios. Water pump leaks so water pump gets replaced. Cooling system builds up pressure and the next weak link which could be an intake gasket decides to give up the ghost.
Replace intake gasket and then an aged block plug gives  up. Or weak heater core…or…
Years ago I replaced a water pump on V6 Chevy for someone. A month or so later it started leaking coolant and what was really irritating to the car owner was that the leak was from a block plug located behind the flex plate. That meant the engine had to come out because of a lousy one dollar plug.
GM could have used brass plugs but that defeats the purpose of mass production;  doin’ it cheap as possible.Yes it’s at least a common place for a leak. I changed the gaskets once and fixed it.Does it really matter if it is common or not? If it needs to be fixed, it needs to be fixed.",,,,

VIDEO: UPS Truck Loses Brakes, Hits Several Cars In Denver Neighborhood 31
Several cars were damaged in Denver's Harvey Park neighborhood when a runaway UPS delivery truck lost control and slammed into several cars. No one was hurt. 





No parking brake to apply?
Driver could not place in gear?Thought ups rule was always shutoff motor? I assume most trucks are auto? Delivery on hilly roads? New thing?Given the failure to start, I’m guessing it might have already been in gear, which is why it didn’t start. Then the brakes “failed” because there was no power assist and the driver was panicking.It’s interesting to me that there seems to be a pattern of blaming the vehicle when an accident happens.  The truck “lost control”, not the driver.  The driver has the controls and the decision making job, not the truck.  If the systems failed, fine, report that, but more often it’s driver error.It bothered me to hear they charged the driver with a crime.  A professional driver is expected to conduct a thorough pre-trip inspection at the beginning of each shift, but most drivers either skip it to save time or only do it once a week, particularly on a company-owned vehicle.  After all, an over-the-road truck driver gets paid by the mile, not by the hour.
Having said that, I’d like to know why the brakes failed.  Was the fluid leaking or low?  I’ve seen hydraulic brake lines blow while a vehicle was in motion.  It can be scary if you’re not lucky enough to be in a place where you can pull over safely.  Maybe the driver should have spotted the rusty brake lines during his inspection, or noticed the brake fluid was dirty, or that the master cylinder was leaking, but the brakes might have failed without showing any previous outward sign, and the driver shouldn’t be cited if that is the case.
If this driver conducted a thorough pre-trip inspection, and didn’t spot anything wrong with the truck, I think UPS should be charged or cited rather than the driver.  It’s not his truck.
If the brakes fail in my personal vehicle, knowing who to blame is a lot easier.  Since I own my car, I’m 100% responsible for its maintenance and repairs to keep it in safe operating condition.  If you hire me to drive your vehicle, which one of us should take that responsibility?If that truck . . . actually, I think it’s technically a walk-in van . . . has an Allison transmission, it very well might not have a park position
Which would make applying the parking brake even more important, versus when I park my car with automatic transmission WITH park position and a parking brake handle to pull up
None of us were there or know what kind of mechanical shape the UPS van was in
Maybe the parking brake shoes were already metal-to-metal before the guy even grabbed the van?
in our fleet, vehicles and operators are usually paired, meaning it’s almost always the same driving the van, every single day
I have no idea how it works at UPS
Could be the drivers get whichever van is ready
But even if that’s the case, he should have familiarized himself with the vehicle before leaving the yard.   And by yard, I mean the UPS facility, hub, or whatever it’s called
When I get a vehicle for service, there are quite a few things I check out before heading out on my test drive.  If I discover a massive coolant leak, brake fluid leaking, bulging tire or something along those lines, I’m not leaving the yard . . . at least not until those things are fixed.



 wentwest:

but more often it’s driver error.


that’s my gut feeling, as wellI also tend to think driver error. There is a knee jerk reaction by people when they screw up and try to lay the blame off on something else.
Much like the Audi Death Cars in the 80s  which was blamed on unintended acceleration. There was nothing wrong with the cars; only the operators. And a number of those operators either admitted later they “may have” been pushing the throttle instead or the bogus claim that they “had both feet planted on the brake pedal” and it was still rocketing ahead. Sorry, the torque converter with a 2200 RPM stall is not going to override the brakes with both feet planted. I’ve never found an issue on any of them I’ve worked on.
A friend of mine worked for Porsche/Audi back then and he said he heard all kinds of non-sensical stories on them. And I tend to believe that guy because he is by far the sharpest mechanic I’ve ever known in my life.


 Whitey:

Sure I went through training for fork lifts and snowplows, they had a clip board in a metal case for pre inspection, there was not one sheet filled out and the clip boards slowly disappeared. Snow plows I did a cursory inspection, but to do a 5 minute checklist to offload a truck 20 feet away, OK, I was bad, air in the tires good to go.

As I’ve mentioned previously, I was a passenger in my friend’s Accord when it was T-boned by a woman driving a Lexus SUV.   I overheard the cop interrogating her at the scene, and she stated, “The harder I pushed on the brake, the faster it went”.   
The cop muttered, “Yeah, that’s what happens when you confuse the brake pedal and the accelerator”.


 VDCdriver:

 … she stated, “The harder I pushed on the brake, the faster it went” .    The cop muttered, “Yeah, that’s what happens when you confuse the brake pedal and the accelerator” .


Th.is why I teach and practice “panic braking” by taking foot from accelerator and pressing the brake as quickly as possible.
Repeathiseveral times after fastening seat-belts before starting thengine to keep it second nature.A few days ago I saw a UPS driver park at the bottom of a long, steep driveway and climb up with his packages to make the delivery. I wonder if this incident influenced his decision. Had the van run away, it could have crossed the street and rammed the front door of the house across the street. Good decision, IMO.Fifty years ago a local parcel delivery company driver making a delivery to a Ford dealership in a Ford van left his engine running with the transmission in Park. When returning to the van he saw it drop out of Park and into Reverse where due to the cold the carburetor fast idle was engaged and the truck crossed the lot to hit a new car and that collision was severe enough that the shift lever dropped out or Reverse and down to Low resulting in the van moving back across the lot to hit another new car. I believe that there was an internal bulletin from FMC to dealers regarding the poor detent on column mounted shifts at the time but a lot of people had egg on their face in the situation I recall.I remember that Ford detent issue as it made national news with some video clips showed cars in reverse going round and round until they hit something.
That almost happened to me on one of my Fords back in the day but luckily I was only half out of the car and managed to catch it in time.I’m sure there have been several screw-ups in the design and/or build of vehicles over the years that have resulted in crashes.  People design them, people screw up.  But after a lifetime of dealing with people’s errors and mistakes and the messy consequences of them I am inclined to look for operator error before a systemic design problem.  UPS has literally thousands of vans, travelling millions of miles and parking so many times only they could estimate the frequency.  If those vans were rolling away because of a design flaw they would be rolling all over everywhere.  They aren’t.

My aunt experienced that exact situation with her Ford, many years ago.   Luckily, there was no significant damage, but because of that incident she began using her e-brake–for the first time.30+ years ago in Central NY this golfing buddy of mine who owned a couple RV stores was telling me what happened over the weekend. Said the manager from one the RV stores called him in a state of panic…Telling on the phone that a AT&T truck lost it’s brakes and rode into the yard destroying about 15 brand new RV’s costing around $75k each. My buddy said calm down…we just sold 15 band new RV’s in one weekend…a new record.I remember seeing a 60 minutes documentary on that issue way back when - they actually had some video footage of the accelerator dropping down and accelerating on it’s own with a car up on the ramp. The issue also persisted with people running into the back wall of their garages after they put the brake interlock system in. I’m sure there were cases of people mixing up the pedals, but there was more to it than that.

It’s good to hear that an owner who takes care of business can let what looks like a catastrophe pass while reassuring his manager that everything will be taken care of. Odds are the owner was quite successful.Very successful…He retired before those HUGE camping/RV stores (like Campers World) came around and drove out all the smaller guys.

7,Need help with carshiping,General Discussion,6,151,"I want to buy a car from another state and have it transported. But I don’t know how to do it, because I`ve never used a shipping carrier for a vehicle before.There are many things to consider when moving a vehicle, my biggest concern being how much it will cost me. Searching for ‘car shipping companies’ in search engines produced seriously misleading or irrelevant results. The majority of carrier websites contain blurb about the company, but no actual answers to my questions. Maybe someone knows some information on this topic?You just have to call several transportation firms with the location from and to plus what kind of vehicle it is . If this is a dealer they might have someone they use .   Also if there is a classic vehicle dealer near you they can tell you who they use .You can try uship, I cannot vouch for the company, but was toying with doing work for them for a little bit.Also in case this helps there have been a number of car shipping articles posted on cartalk.com.

How to Ship a Car Across the US - Car Talk 2
Learn how to ship your car across the US or internationally. Whether shipping a car by truck, rail, boat or air, see which is the best option for you.





It greatly depends on what you’re shipping and when .
A classic Ferrari will be big bucks whenever you ship  but a Corolla  from Florida “dead head” back to the NE  in the Fall will be a bargain.
Need more information where you’re shipping from and to.Might try calling a couple dealers in the area.  Last Summer when I thought I might win a T-Bird out in Boston, shipping was an issue.  The guy that painted my house said a friend arranged car hauling and would get me a good quote.  Never needed it but the guy that won the car lives about 100 miles away in Minnesota.  When I called him to congratulate him, he said a local car dealer had a couple cars coming from Boston and was going to have them put it on the truck.  Don’t know the charge but if the truck is heading that way, the more the merrier.  Dealers move cars around all the time.  Lots of times there are empty spaces on the transports.Others have addressed the shipping issues but a few questions come to mind.
Is this a used car and if so are you seriously considering buying it sight unseen sans test drive or inspection?
Is the car being sold by a dealer or is this one of those internet/don’t know who you are really dealing with situations?",,,,
8,Henry Ford II on seat belts,Safety,78,2.2k,"'Mr. Boyd [Alan S. Boyd, Nation's First Transportation Chief], who retired in 1993, returned to Washington in 2017 for a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Department of Transportation. He told a crowd of 500 dignitaries that soon after taking office in 1967, he had received a call from Henry Ford II, chief executive of Ford Motor at the time, who told him that American motorists didn't want and would never use safety belts in their cars.'

Seems like a reasonable assessment based on seat belt usage during the late 1950’s and 1960’s.
The widespread use of seat belts started in the 1990’s with local enforcement (forced by federal requirements).Our 57 Ford Fairlane 500 had seat belts but I think they were a luxury option on that car and not standard on other models.  Our 58 Chevy didn’t have them.  I think by 61 most cars had them as standard.  You could always have them installed, just weren’t standard.  When  got my 59 Pontiac in 68, I had to buy the belts at the parts store and have them installed at the gas station, so I think GM was maybe a little behind Ford.
I don’t know what’s going on but in the last month two people have been killed in the county not wearing belts.  Car rolls and they get ejected.Indeed:  "" Front airbags, side-impact protection and three-point safety belts. They’re all standard equipment on most of today’s automobiles.
But back in the 1950s and very early 1960s, not even seat belts were standard. Sexy styling, not safety, is what sold cars.
The industry even had a motto: ‘Safety Doesn’t Sell.’ It was a long-held belief that seemingly was proved when a 1956 attempt by Ford Motor Co. to sell a package of innovative safety features called ‘Lifeguard Design’ failed miserably. Chevrolet ate Ford’s lunch in 1956. The motto stuck for decades.""…
“That didn’t go unnoticed by Henry Ford II. He reportedly quipped: ‘McNamara is selling safety, but Chevrolet is selling cars.’”

FORD HAD A BETTER IDEA IN 1956, BUT IT FOUND THAT SAFETY DIDN'T SELL 3





Thank you to hiker16 for locating that article.  I had read something similar in a magazine published in the 60s.
If I remember correctly factory seatbelts became mandatory around ‘64
But people did not use them.
I know I did not use them until I got a CJ5 with vinyl doors.


 Bing:

I think by 61 most cars had them as standard. You could always have them installed, just weren’t standard.


Lap belts didn’t become standard equipment until–I think–'64 or '65.   Our '63 Plymouth didn’t have seatbelts, but Chevron was running a nationwide promotion featuring front lap belt installation for a really low price, so my father took advantage of that.
Our '66 Galaxie 500 came equipped with lap belts, but I think that they were only in the front.   The Federal law mandating lap belts for both front and rear didn’t take effect until 1968.
My '71 Charger was the first vehicle I drove that had shoulder harnesses in the front, and the design was really bad.   They didn’t retract, and if you didn’t want them dangling in the door opening, you had to fold them and stow them above the window with clips that were provided.  It was such a PIA to stow and to un-stow them that I rarely used them, and instead relied on the separate lap belts.
The biggest problem with the Charger’s shoulder harnesses was that they didn’t have an inertia reel mechanism, and if you leaned forward they didn’t yield.  As a result, it was impossible (at least for me…) to reach the e-brake release when I had the shoulder harness attached, so needless to say, I rarely used them.My 64 Pontiac had seatbelts but they were an option, not standard. They became mandetory in '68 in the US. Apparently some states, Wisconsin for one, required them in '62.NH doesn’t have an adult seat-belt law. We had a law for children under 12, then later revises for children under 18. And NH has the lowest seat-belt usage of any state. I’ve seen people drive up from MA on rt 93, then when they cross the border - they unbuckle their seat-belts.
IMHO…if you’re injured in an accident and you weren’t wearing a seat-belt, then insurance companies can deny you coverage.
Lap-belts could cause more damage then no seat-belt. The lap-belt would hold your body in place, but you upper torso would bend forward causing your head to hit the dash or steering-wheel…or causes major back injuries. First few cars I drove only had lap-belts. Wasn’t until the 80’s that I owned a vehicle with a shoulder harness. My Highlander not only has belts with shoulder harnesses, but also at least 10 air-bags.

That’s just… Baffling. It’s not like it’s a straitjacket. Once it’s on you don’t even know it’s there.

My oldest friend from my undergraduate years has flirted with Libertarianism–on and off–for several years.   He fastens his seatbelt, and then sits on it–rather than wearing it–because “wearing it is uncomfortable”.   Yeah, I really believe that sitting on it is more comfortable than wearing it… NOT.
At the age of 73, he is still doing battle with his long-dead parents and the restrictions that they placed on him as a child, and as a result, he fights any kind of regulation, even if violating it could kill him.
Logic has nothing to do with his decisions, it seems.
There are still people that being thrown clear in an accident is safer.
In Florida motorcycle helmets are optional.  You see people riding motorcycles no helmet, wearing shorts and flip-flops.Sometime back in the late '50s, Buick’s Chief Engineer was interviewed by either Popular Science or Popular Mechanics (I subscribed to both publications, so I don’t recall which one it was), and he was questioned on a variety of topics–including seat belts.
When asked if he thought that seat belts should be used, his rambling response included what he (allegedly) did when driving his Grandchildren in his car:
If I think I’m going to be involved in an accident, I call out “Hands!”, and they know to brace themselves against the dashboard.
This leads to the inevitable question…
Was Buick’s Chief Engineer ignorant of the concept of inertia, or was he just expressing GM’s corporate denial of the importance of seatbelts?


 shadowfax:

That’s just… Baffling. It’s not like it’s a straitjacket. Once it’s on you don’t even know it’s there.


By the time I was a teenager I started wearing a seat-belt. Had to wear a seat-belt learning how to drive (my dad and Drivers-ed - no laws yet). By the time I got my license I was uncomfortable if I WASN’T wearing a seat-belt. To this day if for some reason I didn’t put my seat-belt on - within a minute I realize something doesn’t feel right…and then I put my seat-belt on.
I don’t understand the logic of people not wearing a seat-belt. And I really don’t understand the logic of parents NOT making sure their kids are in a seat-belt. Every once in a while I’ll see a car with kids in the back seat and the kids standing up on the seat. It’s absurd.Tom McCahill advocated “heading for the basement”,  when you saw you were going to crash, dive to the floor under the dashboard.
Of course most of Toms’ advice is long outdated.

I had a childhood friend whose father died in a low speed impact. They were pulling into a parking spot on ice in the 1960s, and the car slid into a brick wall at like 5 to 10 mph. The father slid into the steering wheel. He composed himself, got out to inspect the front end and keeled over. By the time the EMTs got there, he had died of internal injuries.

That is why the Tucker automobile featured a spacious area under the dashboard for the passenger to dive into.  Definitely outdated, but at least somewhat safety aware for the time.

9,I’m trying to install power cable and ground cable to battery,Maintenance/Repairs,14,377,"So I’m trying to put a power cable with 1/2 ring into a battery with circular terminals.
However the metal from the ring props a side up and causes it to be near flush when trying to screw back on the battery.

Added image of the battery. Any ideas on how to fix


 Blakensnake:

Any ideas on how to fix


Don’t attach it there. Follow the positive cable to where it goes and attach it there. Or a junction block under-hood or at the fuse box. Most modern cars have several places that can be used for this.
And for goodness sake… FUSE that connection! You don’t want a short that causes a fire… in the trunk… or in the passenger compartmentCompare what was taken off to what you’re putting on. There were long and short positive bolts and various additional pieces required on some models.
several options

GM side mount battery cables at DuckDuckGo 3





The battery is located in the trunk.
And yes power cable is already has a fuse in the middle.
So when your talking follow the power cord from the battery where exactly do I know where to attach it?
Then do I just cut the area where I want to attach, pass the cable thru the ring. Butt connect the area back the was cut, and electrical tape it back up?That’s a GM side mount battery.
You remove the original screws for the for the connections, and install these.

These clamp the terminals down, and provide another connection to the battery.

TesterThat battery cable is attached to something on the other end with a bolt and a ring terminal. Find it and bolt the power line you have to that.
Or use the terminal adaptors Tester showed. But insulate any exposed metal so you don’t zap yourself or short anything else to it.To be honest. If you can’t figure out something this simple, you are not the person to be doing the job.I mean i get that, but to install after market’s they dont really talk about changing out your battery internals for the install. They just talk about 1, 2, 3, 4 your done! which 1234 is done i just cant connect it since our batterys are different.

You just push out the old short one and replace it with the longer style. Simple!!!Welcome back Yosemite. Long time no see.Yes I realize I’m a little dense but all I saw from the video was a guy pulling the bolt out of a side terminal battery.  He wasn’t doing a very good job of it either.  On my diesel with two batteries, one of the terminals had two cables connected to the side terminal.  There were two sizes available, a short bolt for one cable, and a long bolt for double terminals.  I’d change them out every couple years just as maintenance.

10,Loss of about 2.5 quarts of oil over 7500 miles,Maintenance/Repairs,27,1.0k,"I have a 14 elantra gt.  94000 miles.  Over the past 2 oil changes I have lost a lot of oil.  7500 miles, about 2.5 quarts.  5000 miles almost 2 quarts.  I changed spark plugs.  No fouling.  No leaks, at least no drips on garage floor and no identified oily areas.  I plan on changing the pcv valve because it is cheap.  I have started changing oil every 5000 miles instead of the recommended 7500.  Any ideas beyond work valves/seals?  The car is usually driven on longer trips. Work is 37 miles away, highway.Are you adding oil as needed? Hope the pcv fix works.I’m checking and adding now…
The problem came on fast and I did not notice it until the last 2 oil changes.  I did a terrible job of checking oil over the last oil change, probably because it the car was not driven much due to long hours and many consecutive days at work lately.Oil use of a quart every 2500 miles is not, in any way, excessive. Especially for a car with almost 100k miles. Just check your oil on a regular basis so it doesn’t run low.
Changing the pcv can’t hurt nor can 5k oil changes.Keep in mind that most manufacturers would consider a quart per 1,000 miles to be acceptable (although certainly not desirable).It is still under the power train warranty.  I took it into the dealer and that is what they said.  Hyundai won’t do anything unless greater than 1qt over 1000 miles.Don’t even think about major engine work yet.
You can buy a pallet of oil and keep the engine topped off for far less than what it would cost you to “fix” this engine.
Of course, you have to actively monitor the oil level. For some reason that seems to be hard for some people…


 lion9car:

I am only aware of Audi having made that their official position.  Which are the others?
When my friend’s Rav-4 began to show increased oil consumption,  it “passed” Toyota’s 1 qt/1,000 mile oil consumption test, but w/in a few months, just after the elapsed time limit on their service campaign had passed, its oil consumption increased to the rate of 1 qt/500 miles.  If Toyota’s standard had been 1qt/600 miles, he likely would have qualified for a free engine overhaul.By my math we’re talking a quart in 3,000 miles. Nothing to worry about. Keep checking the oil and adding as needed.Wow my 72 nova got to that point and I decided to dump it in 93, and it did not even have a catalytic converter to worry about. I am not a mechanic but the oil was leaking out a hole in front of the distributor on the engine block, stuck a sock in it, but had the foam of death on the oil fill knob. Might have thought about a new engine, but had already welded a plate in to hold the right rear shock as it was a rust bucket. Never denied I was a hillbilly mechanic.When my diesel was down to 500 miles per quart, it didn’t last much longer and started knocking.


 VDCdriver:

I am only aware of Audi having made that their official position. Which are the others?


Mercedes-Benz had those standards . . . at least they did when I worked at the dealershipMy 2012 Camry owners manual says “oil consumption of 600 miles to one quart is not excessive.”  I also found out the the low oil mark on my dipstick is 1.5 quarts below the full mark.
All that said , It has never even burned a cup of oil between it’s annual oil changes and the oil stays so clean it is hard to read. The annual changes have been at 7000 miles or less.So now we’ve established that Audi, Benz and Toyota consider 1qt/600 miles to be acceptable engine oil consumption
I’ve owned cars that used that much engine oil
The catalytic converters did just fine . . . never had one fail a tailpipe smog inspection or throw a P0420 because of the engine oil consumption
And because I topped off the engine oil level as needed every weekend, I also never had an engine knocking

If the OP does this as well, the car might last another 94K miles.


 Mustangman:

If the OP does this as well, the car might last another 94K miles.


Agreed
The cars I’m thinking were all much older and had probably twice . . . or more . . . the mileage of op’s carPCV is a good first step. Next step IMO would be a vacuum gauge test and then a dry/wet compression test to see what the rings are doing; or not doing. In most cases  issues like this are due to stuck oil control rings  Changiing the oil every 5k won’t hurt but likely won’t help at this point if there is a ring issue.
You know the reason why car makers claim a quart every 600 or 1000 miles is normal. To say it’s abnormal would lead to their having to spend billions of dollars replacing engines on their warranty dime even if the problem was customer inflicted.
I have never suffered that problem with any of my cars. My current Lincoln has right at 290k miles on it. Last compression check (275k miles) with new spark plugs it was carrying 185 PSI on all 8 cylinders and never needs oil added before the 3000 to 3500 miles oil changes. Same goes for my Sonoma at160k miles  with the oil still at the FULL mark before I changed it last week.",,,,

So, you think that the folks who designed and built your car could have achieved better gas mileage with the car, but they decided not to do so?
Really?
Hint: If an aftermarket company promises better gas mileage, I would suggest that you approach their marketing claims with skepticism.
Making sure that your car is properly maintained–including the correct viscosity motor oil–and driving as if there was a raw egg between your foot and the gas pedal will do as much as possible to improve gas mileage.  Also, don’t warm up the engine for more than 30 seconds or so, and don’t tailgate.
If you don’t know why tailgating leads to worse gas mileage, post back for an explanation.Wow… NO answers in 2007 and another request of exactly the same question in 2020.
I think that is a record.
The correct answer is… NO, a “chip” won’t give you any real HP gain nor mileage improvement.Thanks for replying. I will look into the suggestions of oil, air filter, etc to help it.
I just bought the car a year ago and went from a Honda civic to the Subaru.
Big difference in mileage. In the city of San Francisco it gets 17mpg.
Which sucks, but the cashier at auto parts store told me his gets the same and it was a gas saving car, can’t remember which. He says because of the hills here and other factors that the gas mileage sucks. He said his car gets 33mpg on the open road.Alan has not posted since 2007 and if you do a simple web search you will see that your MPG is close to the EPA estimate .Your car spends lots of time idling at traffic lights, stop signs and general congestion, and you stop and go again all the time in SF.  It is rare that your car spends much time in the higher gears.  It’s no surprise that you get poor mileage.  Next time get an electric car.  Older Nissan Leaf?I would not want to own a 2000 Subaru. But that’s me.

All true.
All you can do if you want better gas mileage is to…

Move to a less-urban, less-hilly area
Pay careful attention to its maintenance
Pay careful attention to your driving behaviors
Have you not noticed how hilly San Francisco is? Going up those hills half the time is not offset by going down them the other half of the time. Then factor in the other elements of urban driving and 17 MPG sounds about right. If there is a perfect environment for a hybrid vehicle, this may be it.


 Mustangman:

NO, a “chip” won’t give you any real HP gain nor mileage improvement.


Yes it can, but there is a trade off and that is emissions.  Especially in California, if you change the chip, or reprogram it, it will NOT pass the state emissions test, even though some of the aftermarket chip makers claim otherwise.
Chips are seldom changed anymore, usually they are reprogrammed, but the reprogramming can be detected and that will automatically fail the emissions test.
Reprogramming can also shorten the life of the engine.


 keith:

Reprogramming can also shorten the life of the engine.


… as we found out from the person who used a performance chip in her nearly-new Ford Diesel pickup, and when the engine self-destructed, Ford rightfully denied her warranty claim.


 keith:

Yes it can, but there is a trade off and that is emissions


There is a discussion point here… normally aspirated engines have, at best 3 things that can help performance. Spark advance, variable cam timing (if equipped) and wide-open throttle mixture. Mixture changes can only be used at WOT or the O2 sensors will constantly throw rich mixture codes. Spark timing can be advanced and force the use of premium fuel (as most “chips” or “tunes” do) together with cam timing changes to boost high rpm HP. These last 2 will potentially cause a fail in an emissions test. All 3 together with premium fuel will only help HP a small amount. 5-10%.
Turbo gas and diesel engines are a whole 'nother story as boost limits can also be raised along with the previous 3 calibrations. It can boost power an easy 20 to 30% on many engines with no other changes. Shortens their life, too. Sometimes drastically! Diesels add one more element… diesels can run really rich and make lots of power (as well as Roll Coal) with lots of boost. Until they experience boost run-away and blow up.
The Subie in question has neither a turbo nor variable cam timing so spark and WOT fuel are pretty much all the tools available. With 165 HP, a 5% gain is 8hp.  So for that reason, I stand by my “no real HP gain” statement. You might disagree and that’s OK.
That said, my 420 HP, normally aspirated Mustang has a “tune” that is worth about 10% on premium fuel… which is 42 hp… well worth it!How many miles do you drive if you live in the city? My street rod has a 3-speed auto. I looked into putting in an overdrive. But I don’t drive enough.Your EPA estimated city gas mileage in the city is 20 with an about oil transmission and 18 with a manual. That assumes your daily drives are the same as their city course. The estimate is also for an Impreza in nearly new condition. Your gas mileage is not so far off that I would do much, other that air in the tires, spark plugs, and engine air filter.Hello JT Sanders. Thanks for chiming in. I discovered this Subaru forum with the question of what people get in gas mileage.
I’m posting it for those of you that have similar concerns that I have.
https://www.ultimatesubaru.org/forum/topic/84256-what-do-you-get-for-gas-mileage/?page=3 1
I have a rebuilt engine with about 110,000 and a body with 180,000. It’s a 2.2, 2000 Subaru Impreza L wagon. Stick.
I noticed with the Subaru forum that gas mileage is all over the chart and there is talk about winter driving and summer driving for gas mileage.
I’m due to an oil change and will probably put synthetic in it this time. I will check the air filter and understand that different air filters make a difference. The person I bought it from said the air filter was changed, and he did head gasket, and all the stuff when you put a rebuilt engine in a car. Saw in the subaru forum that a complete brake job made a difference as well as some reporting better gas mileage with higher octane gas.
What are you folks with Subaru’s getting in gas mileage? I will probably post this question separately.


 bigdogs2_158797:

You will not gain anything by synthetic oil except possibly longer time between oil changes . An air filter is pretty much the same across the board and a Google search will tell you that the modern engines are not effected by the air filter as the old carb engines.  Just relax and drive sensibly because where you are you are not going to get much better then you do know.Unless it’s badly clogged, an air filter will not significantly change fuel efficiency in a modern fuel injected engine.

If you push 87 octane, the diesel nozzle isn’t going to pump anything.Actually I feel the same way about Kwik Trip with their new labeling of the gas pumps.  You have to study the pumps and read the little labels to make sure you don’t get 85% ethanol.  So I don’t stop there anymore when traveling.  I also have long avoided BP since reports of clogged fuel systems-fairly or unfairly, I heard it more than once.  Who wants to be 500 miles from home with a clogged fuel system?

This is the part that confuses me. I can see accidentally grabbing the wrong handle. I can’t see pushing some random button without actually reading the label on it on top of that.

Well like I said, if you drive around to other states and stop at unfamiliar stations, it can be very confusing even for us that know what to look for.  Often there are several nozzles and multiple buttons to push and sometimes the colors yellow, green, black are not standard.  No problem with my local station.  One nozzle with three choices of gas grade.  Diesel is on a separate island, and 85% ethanol is not an option.  Drive around the country a little bit to see what I mean.Still, a simple matter of reading.  Yes, when getting gas in Georgia the pump handle colors were reversed from what I normally see in Florida.  Pushing the right button gets you the right product.

After filling up at a gas station last night that offers E10 in 87-89-91, E15 88, E85, and Diesel, I can see how you could mistake it. This one is new enough that E10 blends are black, E15 Blue, E85 Yellow, Diesel Green, but I’ve seen older stations in the same chain where this isn’t true. If you pick up the nozzle first, the fuel that dispenses out of that one lights up prompting you to pick it. If the diesel had a black head, I could absolutely see people popping it in, then hitting the only lit up button (for diesel) and putting diesel into their carA couple years ago the wife was heading to the cabin and stopped for gas at the Coop station 150 miles away.  Then she called and said she had filled the tank with ethanol free and didn’t know if that was a problem or not.  I said the car will love it drive on.  Wife is a PhD and not exactly stupid but even in Minnesota where everyone is above average, these pump labels are becoming a problem.


 lion9car:

This is the part that confuses me. I can see accidentally grabbing the wrong handle. I can’t see pushing some random button without actually reading the label on it on top of that.


I can. If you’re use to only pumping gas on a pump that doesn’t have diesel…then you may just select the button on the far left without ever reading it. Now first time using a pump that has a diesel handle…grab wrong handle and press the button on the far left.Re the image at the top: I thought the lady was just cleaning off road tar. Is that not gasoline with smaller nozzle pipe?

No, many years too late. Pre 1900 the French built some. In 1907, J Walter Christie built race cars with FWD. Citroen built a production car starting in 1934, 2 years earlier than Cord.True Story, I lived in Kenmore NY as a teenager.

For road cars, could very well be the one that cracked 100 mph. Cords were fast.
Harry Miller built a FWD Indy 500 racer that averaged just over 100 mph finishing 2nd the 1925 Indy 500. The car had a straight 8, DOHC, 4 valve per cylinder engine copied from the 1913 Peugeot 4 cylinder Indy engine that was the first to qualify on the pole at just over 100 mph. The picture of the Miller car is below.

Yes, that Cord model–the 810–was fast, but its fatal flaw was a tendency to overheat.   The first Cord, the L-29, was also FWD, but its fatal flaw was that the engine was set so far back from the front drive axle that it had terrible traction on upgrades.   Groucho Marx bought a luxurious L-29, but after finding that it was unable to climb his steep gravel driveway in Beverly Hills, he quickly–and angrily-- sold it.
Anyway, this is a Cord L-29…

14,"2005 Toyota Camry, Frost on Inside, Blower Motor burning smell",Maintenance/Repairs,5,355,"I have a 2005 Toyota Camry LE. Engine is 2AZ-FE. Automatic Transmission is U-250E.
===Frost on Inside===
This morning I had frost on the inside of my vehicle on the windshield and rear view window, as well as the outside. I know this happens when moisture freezes. So I guess I have a leak to the outside?
I had all of my windows closed.
There was no snow dragged in on the inside of my vehicle.
The vehicle sat for a day.
I recently had my windshield replaced.
I recently replaced the cabin filter.
What could be the source of letting moisture into my vehicle? Anyone have any suggestions?
===Blower Motor===
When I replaced my cabin filter, there was a lot of leaves and other organic material on the top of it. I tried to pull it out as carefully as possible. Some of the material went down though into the blower motor. I pulled as much of it as I could with my hands. I wasn’t able to get a vacuum in there. I tried pulling out the blower motor, but I wasn’t successful. I removed all the fasteners holding it in, but there was a white plastic clip thing to hold a cable attached to the bottom of the enclosure that the blower motor sits in. I didn’t have much room to visually check it, but there appeared to be a fastener holding in the cable harness to the enclosure. It was very tight and I had no way of removing the fastener. So I put everything backed together. I heard some leaves moving around when I turned on the heat. Today when I was driving I started to notice a burning smell, almost like burning electronics, when I had the heat on. So I immediately turned it off and rolled down the windows and continued driving. I then rolled them back up and the smell went away. So it appears that it’s related to the HVAC system.
Does anyone have any idea how to get the blower motor out of my car? I need to remove the leaves regardless because the sound it was making with the heat on wasn’t pleasant to listen to. I found a video on YouTube on how to do it on a older Camry but it wasn’t like mine with the cable harness stuck to the bottom of the enclosure that the blower motor goes into.
Could the leaves have started to burn and caused the burning smell? I don’t think it gets hot enough in there to start to burn something?
Isn’t the blower motor essentially a fan that blows hair? So I was expecting with the time the blower motor would just cut up the leaves into fine material to the point where it wasn’t noticeable.
Thanks for any help.Regarding the frost issue, a frequent problem is using the HVAC system in recirculation mode. This causes a buildup of moisture from your breath.
See if you can find a factory service manual for the procedure to remove the blower motor. You can get a new blower motor from RockAuto for less than $40 so you might want to consider replacing it while you have things apart.Here’s how to remove the blower motor.
How to replace Toyota Camry Cabin Fan Blower Motor. Years 1991 to 2017
As far as the burning smell, what may have happened is leaves have come in contact with the blower resistor.
image600×600 54.2 KB
The blower resistor gets very hot depending on the speed that’s selected.
It gets so hot that there are heat sinks on the resistor so the blower can cool it.
TesterThanks. I think my car is slightly different. I got some pictures from my car.
The three fasteners are three screws. The third one is behind the white cable harness I wasn’t able to remove the harness, but was able to remove the screw behind it holding in the blower motor.
image1579×1223 374 KB
I tried to unclip/unfasten the white cable harness but I couldn’t figure it out. I tried wiggling it and squeezing it, but it appeared to be fastened to it somehow. I tried putting my finger all around it and thought I felt some sort of fastener, but wasn’t 100 percent sure. I had now way to look at it, and not sure at all how to take the cable harness off.
image1578×1178 298 KB
There was one fastener that I circled in blue on the white harness that is visible that I was able to take off. But there apparently another one that was behind the fat part where I put a question mark, at least as far I could tell from what I felt with my finger.

18,Lean Fuel Trim,Maintenance/Repairs,14,439,"Hi Everyone,
I have a 2006 Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec V. My short term fuel trim readings seem to be at about +7% idle, +5% to 9% under load, which the occasional +10% or so spike. Sometimes, load acceleration will be ±2%, and the idle will frequently settle at +/-2% but will oscillate back to +7%.
What’s curious is that the long term fuel trim reads 0.0% at all times, and doesn’t change. Is my scan tool producing an error, or is this long term fuel trim normal despite my short term fuel trim reading lean?
Thank youThose numbers are not a problem.
Typically the CEL lights at 25%.
The fuel injectors might be a little dirty: toss a bottle of Techron in the tank.
Ethanol in the gas also has effect since it needs a different air/fuel ratio.Thank you for the information. Is it normal for the Long term fuel trim to always read 0.0% though? Even when STFT is reading higher numbers, LTFT will stay at 0.My son has one of those.  Have you modified it in any way such as a low restriction muffler or CAI or the NISMO cams?  These mods will throw off your STFT, but usually the LTFT as well.
You don’t have a problem though, your vehicle is operating well within spec.  If you haven’t cleaned the MAF sensor, you might do that but otherwise I would not do anything else at this time.  Don’t do a Red Green here, “if it ain’t broke, fix it till it is.”Hi Keith, the vehicle has a aftermarket header to address the problem with the pre-cats destroying the engine. But other than that, it is all stock!Not being sure what kind of OBD reader you have I’d suggest you may have chosen the wrong PID for LTFT, bank2 rather than bank1, for instance. Anyway worth a double-check if it’s applicable to your device
Hi, it s a ThinkOBD 100 scanner, as shown in the photo.
ThanksI see, I’m no expert on these things and I use a Bluetooth dongle version myself. On mine, after I load a yr, mk and model, I need to go through a data base of pertinent PIDs and select not only ones that I want but ones that there is output for coming from the onboard computer module. If I want oil temp, for instance, and I select that but if the car’s output doesn’t provide for that parameter the gauge will 0 or no data, etc.
Unless this is some sort of ‘thing’ for this model that it doesn’t have LTFT for reason unkown that LTFT should normally be dancing around along with the STFT.
Have you tried this reader on another car?
If it also doesn’t show LTFT on other cars I’d say you have a faulty OBD reader. If it does show on another car than the OBD port on your Sentra may be at fault, bad connection, broken pin, etc. Unless, of course, it’s a thing on this model. I like to see a STFT of less than 5. More begins to be problematic but you still should be showing some value other than zero for LTFT. Hope some of this long winded reply helps.Hi Neburex,
It does, alot thanks. The scanner automatically sets the correct settings for the car. I was wondering why LTFT is reading 0, and I thought that wasn’t normal. I’ll look more into diagnosing the scanner or finding out about this specific model of Sentra.Ltft is a universal PID for all cars. There is a group of universal PIDs and a set of vehicle specific PIDs. Compare another reader.Sorry but I have to ask, what does PID stand for?Parameter ID. Basically an identifier of the OBD thing you are trying to read.Thanks Mustangman. I also contacted the manufacturer of the scanner, and they said that LTFT should be fluctuating. I’m going to try another scanner today.When you installed the new header, you had to move both O2 sensors downstream.  Usually the sensor 1 is mounted where the sensor two was mounted and sensor two requires a new bung installed after the cat.  You have eliminated the warm up cat, assuming that you used the NISMO header.
That will throw off your sensor 1 STFT.  Add to that that the connector for the sensor is in a bad place and tends to get full of water and has to be frequently dried out or you get bad readings.  You also have to make an extension harness for sensor 2.Hi Keith,
I have the 2J Street Spec Spyder header. I did verify with the manufacturer of the header the correct placement for the oxygen sensor 1 (top bung). I just left O2 sensor 2 alone - I was told readings from 02 sensor 2 do not affect engine performance (I do not currently have any engine codes)?
Thank you",,,,
19,Caliper Bracket - Difficult To Get Leverage/Space With Breaker Bar,Maintenance/Repairs,16,407,"I’ve been spending days trying to take out the caliper bracket off my VW Passat. I’m trying to replace pads and rotors for the rear. The bracket bolts are in a difficult spot for me to insert a breaker bar and get leverage. I can barely fit my socket wrench in the area, but there is no way the bolts will loosen. Has anyone ever experienced this? It seems that the only way to get the leverage needed is to raise up the car but I don’t have that kind of technology. The socket size for the bolts is M14.
Thanks in advance.I’d try a combination wrench… the closed end… with a pipe on the end and sometimes a hammer. The hammer is on the shank of the wrench to shock the bolt loose while applying torque. Works best with tools warrantied for life… the life of an abused tool, that is.
Or you can loop another combo wrench closed end over the open and and use that as a lever extension.

almost as well as PB Blaster
My neighbor asked me to come over and help him get the calipers/brackets off his car.
When I got there, he just had the vehicle raised up as far as the scissor jack that came with the car would raise it. No jack stands. 
No room for leverage.
I ran back to the shop and got my floor jack and a couple of jack stands so he could raise the vehicle higher.
A couple of hours latter he returned the stuff, and said it made it a hell of a lot easier.
So, if you want to do this type of work, you have to raise the vehicle.
TesterAir compressor and impact wrench.Have you removed the caliper from the bracket?Generally no room for an impact gun on caliper bracket bolts.  You can try a box wrench and hammer. Or a box wrench over your ratchet handle to give you 90 degree leverage.
Bosx wrenches are not used much any more , but when I first started working on cars,hardly anyone but pro mechanics had  ratchet sets.  A complete shade tree wrench set included, deep off set box wrenches, open end and combo wrenches and of course, no metrics,
I had to dig out one of my old Craftsman 90 degree off set box wrenches.  I was removing a lawn mower engine from a rotted deck and the bolt heads were shallow  and incredibly tight, every socket I had had too much champ-her to grab the head securely and I did not want ,to grind off a good socket.  Th old box wrench and a hammer did it.I have about a 10"" piece of square tubing that fits over the ratchet.  So it can slide up or down depending on how much room I have or what leverage I need.  On caliper bolts though, I just give the pipe a hard rap with a hammer to dislodge it.  The nice thing about a ratchet is you make sure you are turning it the right direction.  I don’t know anything about the VW layout though but can’t be that much different.
Edit:  Yeah I missed the part about not having the technology to raise the car.  You do need to take the wheel off, and then you do need to put a jack stand under it for safety.  Just bite the bullet and spend $20-30 for a “lifetime” of use.  I’m sure mine are 40 year old and still fine.  Yeah I did take them over to the neighbor that had his kid’s car jacked up and working underneath.  Cheap life insurance.If you are saying that you are trying to redo the brakes with no floor jack and jack stands you really need to rethink this entire repair. That can turn out to be a lethal thing to do and when a car falls it will happen in a nano-second.
With the car down low you are not going to get any leverage anyway.
As I mentioned recently on another thread; 3 people in my area have died when cars fell on them. One was a long time friend and the saddest one of all was a 21 year old guy changing his motor oil with only a scissor jack. He left behind a young wife and 2 kids; ages 2 and 3.To clarify: I am using a jack. I wouldn’t be able to take the wheel off without a jack. However the jack I am using is the one that came with the spare tire. I own a floor jack though so maybe that will lift the car higher. I own jack stands but I didn’t use them because my VW has those four jack points. I can’t fit both a jack and jack stand under them at the same time. For extra protection, I place the wheel I took off underneath the car.

That’s nuts. If you don’t have the proper equipment to do the job SAFELY then take it someplace or buy the right equipment.Putting the removed wheel under the car is a smart move.
You need to find a different place to jack from, so that you can put the jack stands at the corner lift points. They can be found. But if you’re uncomfortable in selecting a different spot then don’t do it. The wrong place could damage something or get the jack stuck.


 Daniel-237:

Those are for emergencies only, use your floor jack



 Daniel-237:

I own jack stands but I didn’t use them because my VW has those four jack points. I can’t fit both a jack and jack stand under them at the same time.


Then stop doing what you’re doing. Don’t rely on a jack alone. The tire is a good backup to the jack stands, but it shouldn’t be your primary backup. I put the jack stands under the frame when I’m using mine.And this is especially dangerous when you’re trying to loosen a stuck nut/bolt, you can push the car enough for the small car jack to fall over.  You MUST use jack stands.Placing the wheel that was removed under the car adjacent to the wheel well can offer some protection but a jack stand on a level concrete surface is highly recommended.I am beginning to conclude that this is a job you should not proceed with.  There is just a general lack of understanding.  You don’t need to jack the car up higher than to get the wheel off.  You don’t need to put the jack stands under the four jacking points.  You used the emergency jack but have a floor jack and jack stands, but don’t have the technology to deal with safely raising the car?
Sorry but I’m done here.  Just take it to a dealer before someone gets hurt.I am trying to learn. I was successful in changing my front brakes and rotors. I was able to do my own oil change. The rear rotors/pads are a different story. That is why I am here.",,,,

Just have to kick the clumps off when you get where you’re going. And unless you have headlight washers, your headlights get dirty in about 1 minute of driving in traffic. Not really possible to keep them clean except when you stop.I see it quite often. When I was young and invincible, I’ve done it a few times hoping the defrosters would work soon. Many times I’d have to pull over to wait it out. Very dangerous. Now that I’m older and not so stupider, I will always have all windows cleared. All snow brushed off the whole car.

 Purebred:

Much like when I was growing up and driving in Minneapolis.


I can still recall being appalled when one of the faculty members pulled into our NJ school parking lot in his Mercury Grand Marquis with the car looking more or less like a mobile mountain of snow.
When I mentioned to him that his totally-obscured brake lights were a major hazard, he just gave me a confused look.I used the second cup of coffee method. Start the car, go back inside and have another cup of coffee. Then there was enough heat to clear the windshield.
We don’t get much bad weather where I live and if we do get it it is more ice than snow.  If I have to go somewhere I also use the second or third cup of coffee method.I used that method as well. Ice storms were common in southern Ohio and it was impossible to scrape a 1/8 layer of ice off the windows. Warm the car and it comes off much easier. If you can get IN the car to start it, that is.
Experienced that at the airport flying in from vacation at a delayed flight 1:30 am arrival greeted with a thick coat of ice on the car. Had a heckuva time just opening any of the 4 doors to start the car.


 shadowfax:

The frozen fender clumps though… Drive for 5 minutes in some storms around here and it’ll be like that. Just have to kick the clumps off when you get where you’re going.


It’s even like that in Maryland. I’ve left work without the fender clumps. By the time I get home, they are huge, and sometimes they grow large enough to get knocked off on the road. I do get rid of them before pulling inside, though.Remember the frost within, on every window except a patch of the windshield and maybe the grid on the back window? It was usually on cars whose HVACs were set on Recirculate. Small Japanese cars, especially, it seems.
Now it seems most HVACs won’t run on Recirc when the defroster is engaged. If I have my Chrysler set on Recirc, when I shut it off and start it back up, it is on Fresh. Smart: some engineering to save us from mistakes or ignorance.NH passed a law about 10 years ago requiring that all cars must be cleaned of snow. But still see it. I was out on the roads yesterday after our 14"" storm. I think they were taking the car out to clean it off…it was the light fluffy snow.

Concrete poured over culverts is self supporting, whereas, to my knowledge, asphalt is not.Maybe… concrete culvert pipe laid down to let the road pass over, concrete poured over to supoort traffic.
Asphalt is a flexible surface that must be supported by a solid foundation. That is why asphalt highways have a concrete base, not a gravel base.

In the south they do…not up here in the north. Ours is very compressed gravel base about 2-3 feet thick.


 MikeInNH:

Ours is very compressed gravel base about 2-3 feet thick


Must be a solution to the freeze-thaw expansion.
My Ohio highway experience is when any major highway gets re-paved, they are done in concrete with a gravel base. Once the surface of the concrete starts to spall, they lay down an asphalt cap.
I lived near a recently re-paved highway for a few years done in concrete. It was NOISY as heck in the winter when the leaves were off the trees. We were less-than-patiently waiting for the asphalt cap to be added to reduce the noise.
A number of years ago, a ring-road got built in the Phoenix area all in concrete. Concrete holds up better than asphalt in the desert heat. The noise was a huge issue with the locals so they sprayed a coating that looked like asphalt seal coat on the road to quiet things down.Maybe they bridged the gap over the creek with a reinforced concrete plate.  The steel could be completely within the concrete slab.


 RandomTroll:

Why was this bit concrete?


Strength, concrete can be reinforced, rebar doesn’t work well in asphalt.


 Purebred:

Concrete poured over culverts is self supporting


It takes at least 60 feet to traverse the culvert; the concrete bit is only 15.  Nothing is under the concrete to hold it up.



 Mustangman:

concrete culvert pipe laid down to let the road pass over, concrete poured over to supoort traffic.


There’s no pipe: it’s open unfinished dirt in this stretch.



 wentwest:

Maybe they bridged the gap over the creek with a reinforced concrete plate.


The gap is 4 times wider; nothing holds up the concrete part.


 RandomTroll:

The gap is 4 times wider; nothing holds up the concrete part.


Wanna bet?  The law of gravity is final.  If nothing is holding it up, it would not be up.


 wentwest:

If nothing is holding it up, it would not be up.


There’s no extra support under the concrete part.In the village adjacent to us concrete drive aprons are prohibited due to plow damage. A corrugated metal pipe is typically used under asphalt.",,,,
25,Block heater for a 2010 Toyota Corolla?,Maintenance/Repairs,26,874,"I picked up a 2010 Toyota Corolla as a commuter car, live in Maine and it’s parked outside.  What are your thoughts on installing a block heater foe those frigid winter daysI drive a 2009, which is basically the same car. We don’t have Maine winters in Missouri but it does get cold and mine has always started reliably. AFAIK Mainers only use block heaters on diesel vehicles. Just be sure the battery is good and there’s plenty of gas in the tank.
One quick, unrelated tip: The “add” mark on the dipstick on the 1.8 liter indicates 1 1/2 quarts low rather than the usual 1 quart so don’t let it get down to “add.”What is the lowest temp you expect for the winter?
If I had your situation, I would buy one of those battery/jumper cable combos, and keep it in the house. It would only be needed when your battery is not enough. NOTE:  I would also make sure my car’s battery was in top condition.
In the 1970’s, my carbureted Accord started on a -29 F morning without any aid.Modern cars… and a 2010 is modern… can easily start at -40 F or C with a good  battery and the correct engine oil. You don’t  need a block heater.I have a 2012 Corolla and it always started in sub zero temperature.I never  needed a block heater even in northern Canada where I live. Maine weather is like summer to us.In Minnesota and South Dakota in the old days we used to use block heaters.  These days with fuel injection it really is not necessary for starting unless you are beyond 20 below.  True they do help cold oil circulation but if you use the specified oil and drive moderately for a few miles, it’ll do fine.When my vehicles were parked outside in the winter with no garage, I installed a block heater with a timer.
This allowed the heater to heat the coolant a couple of hours so that when the vehicle was started, there was hot air coming out the vents.
Nice!
TesterI still love block heaters, easier starting, less wear on engine parts so old wives tales go, Used mine at 15 degrees and less, Last 2 cars had block heaters, 2 now don’t, but retired and hoping not to have to go anywhere if it is below 0Thank you for all your perspectives


 Mustangman:

You don’t need a block heater.


That’s true, but I think the OP should get one anyway.  If I lived in Maine in the winter, I’d have one.I think I would want one, too.Whether or not you get a block heater, I’d want full synthetic oil in the crankcase.  Have you changed the oil since you got it?Years ago, it was -23 F (way below zero).  My 1971 Ford Maverick was outdoors.  It had a carburetor and regular breaker points ignition.  I had 10W-40 in the crankcase.  I got in the Maverick the next morning and it turned over slowly, but it started right up.  I let the car warm up for about 10 minutes to be sure the gas line wasn’t frozen and drove off.  Several years later, I had a 1978 Oldsmobile Cutlass.  The temperature was just as cold.  I had 10W-30 in the crankcase.  The Oldsmobile did have electronic ignition.  It started right up.
With today’s fuel injection, electronic ignition, and synthetic oils, I don’t think block heaters are necessary if I could start my cars from the 1970s that didn’t have block heaters.

It’s still nice when you start the car, and heat comes out vents.
TesterMine kept the engines at 35 degrees or so, no instant heat but always a start.@Tester.  If you want instant heat, a Stewart-Warner Southwind gasoline heater is the way to go


 Triedaq:

I think heated seats would be more practical.@Whitey. I once owned a 1961 Chevrolet Corvair.  The heater pulled hot air off the exhaust manifold.  It was almost instant heat.I once owned a 1969 Porsche 912, which also used an exhaust manifold heat exchanger for cabin heat.  It was terrible.  I spent two winters in Madison, WI, driving around with an ice scraper in hand to scrape the frost off the inside of the windshield.  But, oh, it would go through the snow.  In really cold weather (-25-deg-F), when the car was first started it would tend to move in Neutral if the clutch was engaged.
BTW, and back on topic, in 1969, when I was apartment hunting in Madison, many of the advertisements offered “headbolt heater outlets”.  I had no idea what they were talking about.  Why would you want to heat your headbolts?  And what kind of outlet did it take?Block heater? Freeze plug style? Magnetic element on oil pan? What is available these days?",,,,

Are there any known issues with the transmission as described, if so is there a resolution


Known issues ?  Seriously , transmissions do wear out and the resolution is a rebuilt transmission .Thanks for the reply,
Enjoy your weekendHi Alan. Not a Grand Cherokee owner, but I looked on carcomplaints.com and it seems that transmission problems aren’t uncommon.


CarComplaints.com



2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee problems
The 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee has 2825 problems & defects reported by Grand Cherokee owners. The worst complaints are electrical, engine, and accessories - interior problems.





Have you gotten yours diagnosed? Are you weighing different options?The main questions that arise to me are…
Did you buy the vehicle new?
Has the transmission ever been serviced?
I do no understand the complaint completely. Surging could be engine related and I have no idea what sways means as that generally refers to suspension issues.
For what it’s worth, a long time friend who is an independent transmission rebuilder and has been doing it since the mid 70s after taking over from his dad who did it since way back before then has told me that the vast majority of transmission problems he sees day in and day out are caused by…
Not changing the fluid regularly.
Transmission leaks which cause the transmission to run low on fluid.


 Alanfvidlund:

Transmission surges/sways


An engine can surge, but I’m not quite sure that transmissions can do the same.
Perhaps I am wrong on that point, and someone can educate me on that point.  
However, I am positive that a transmission is not something that can “sway”, unless its mounts are broken.
Can the OP try to find a more… conventional… description of the problem with his vehicle, or can he at least respond to the following questions?

Is it shifting through all of the gears?
Is the problem only noted when the engine is cold, or only when it is warm, or does this happen at all operating temperatures?
And, if the OP is convinced that this is a transmission problem, then the inevitable questions are…
Have you checked the fluid level, color, and odor?
How many times over the past 9 years has the trans fluid been changed?

For all we know via cyberspace, he might have an engine issue or a suspension/steering problem, rather than a transmission problem.
(Note: I hope that my questions aren’t interpreted as hostile “interrogation”, as an OP in another thread concluded–bizarrely.)Hmmmm…
Three days later, and the OP has not answered any of the questions that I posed.

New issue on my recent truck handed down to me. The 4x4 low light engages on the dashboard without me touching the 4x4 control. The car thinks it in 4x4, the speedometer will even read low mph, ie 10mphs, but I was cruising at 40mph. It won’t get out of this mode unless I unhook the battery. Then it goes back to normal and we drive it for awhile.  Then it happens again a few weeks later.
Any ideas? I was thinking of swapping out the solenoids first.A bad solenoid is a possibility, but my gut is saying it’s a faulty 4wd switch. You might also have a bad speed sensor.Good info. I ordered a solenoid for 10 bucks already with the new and improved cover. Guess a common issue is water getting into it so either way the new design is an improvement and potential preventative for future issues.

Man who biked 10 miles to work midnight shift gets surprised with free, fixed... 24
Each Christmas, Boggs Auto in Gloucester County donates a car to someone in need.





That’s great. There are also charities that accept donated cars, fix them, and give them to people in need. I saw a spot on a TV show that documented a local charity that did this. There was a single mother with two children. They gave her a minivan that she used too get to work and ferry the kids to after school events. She could not have afforded a car without the donation and didn’t even have a job until she got the minivan.A drive-thru at a Dairy Queen in Brainerd , Minnesota, was busy last week when more than 900 cars participated in a pay -it- forward chain. According to Dairy Queen , the 900-car pay -it- forward event spanned two-and-a-half days.What sort of pay it forward event is it?  I can think of a few ways to do one.Great story, the kind we need to hear. Thanks for sharing.Actually you pay for the cat behind you, someone buys their order and says bill me for the guy behind me. Then the following cars get their food and pay the bill for the car behind them, The last guy at night left $10 for the first car in the morning.

900 people feel good for paying for a meal for another and also receiving a meal paid for by a generous person. Meanwhile the restaurant profits from the promotion by outwitting the cheese heads.call me weird . . . but I’m curious just what the previous old car was that needed a lot of work


 Nevada_545:

Meanwhile the restaurant profits from the promotion by outwitting the cheese heads.


The restaurant does not profit, they sell the meals at the same price no matter who pays for it. It was not a promotion, just started with one person doing it and it carried on. Quit looking for evil intentions behind someones kindness. And people in MN are probably vikings fans not cheeseheads, ie packers fans. Apologize anytime.


 Barkydog:

I had that happen last Summer at a DQ drive through.  I got up to pay and the girl said it was already paid.  I was kinda flabbergasted and embarrassed that someone paid for me.  So I just paid for the one in back of me.  Only 3-4 cars so I don’t know where it stopped.  I had a friend that used to try and do a “random act of kindness” once a day or so.  Usually at a grocery store.


 Barkydog:

I’m sorry, I overlooked the Brainerd note and I am not familiar with non profit restaurants.


 Nevada_545:

I am not familiar with non profit restaurants.


As stated previously DQ charges the same for every meal, where in the world wide of sports did you get an idea of a non profit? They are selling the items regardless of who pays for it, aks if I need to repeat this again. Your quote “Meanwhile the restaurant profits from the promotion by outwitting the cheese heads.” apology any time!

I couldn’t find any details on their 2019 car donation, but I was able to find an article from 2018.

The restaurants revenue probably doubled…so more revenue…then more profit.
Great event though. And glad the Restaurant held it. Good for them.There’s a Dairy Queen in Hudson NH I drive past every once in a while and on a nice summer night they always have a line of at least 30 cars.speaking of refurbishing cars for people in need . . .
several years ago, I suggested the very idea at one of my neighborhood council meetings
I clear as day suggested that we get an old car in mechanically great condition for a needy family, since the council was always talking about families in bad financial shape
They never went anywhere with my idea
I felt it would have been good publicity for the neighborhood council
To be clear, I didn’t suggest fixing a car that had been declared a total loss due to body damage
I suggested fixing a cheap car that was in need of mechanical work . . . think tires, brakes, suspension work, tune-up , getting it ready to pass smog and such things
Those things I mentioned can quickly add up to very big money, as we all knowWe tried to donate my moms 15 rear old van to the church, low mileage, pristine shape, they would not accept it as it had a check engine light. Donated it to NPR, got a tax deduction of $4500, auction sale price. 2003 sold in 2018.I always manage to get the short end of the pay it forward drive thru thing. A couple years ago I grabbed a cup of black coffee at a chain coffee shop. “The guy in front of you paid for it.”  OK, I’ll pay for the car behind me then.  “That’ll be $45.”  Seems it was a family of 4 who ordered fancy coffees and breakfast.

39,2006 Toyota Scion’s windows don’t work,Maintenance/Repairs,1,147,i have a scion xb. My windows do not work. What could be the problem I have a 2006Have you checked the fuse?,,,,
40,2010 Ford Fusion “Service Power Steering Now”,Maintenance/Repairs,46,93.9k,"First, I should say that my Fusion has an EPAS (Electronic Power Assist Steering) which means that there is no hydraulic pump but rather an electric motor which provides the assistance to the steering system.
In January I had the “Service Power Steering Now” indication on the IPC (Instrument Panel Cluster) as well and an AdvanTrac (Ford’s traction control system) light.  Also, the power steering was not operational even after restarting the car and disconnecting the battery.  I did some reading online and found that corrosion on the battery cable can cause this issue.  It turns out that my battery cable had actually cracked in one place from excessive corrosion and was beyond repair.  So, I ordered a new harness and changed the entire cable.  Even after the cable was replaced the fault didn’t clear and the power steering was not available which makes driving quite the workout.
I took the car to the Ford dealership to have the computer reset.  The first several mechanics didn’t know what to do.  Eventually, someone pulled an old grey bearded man resembling Santa Claus from the back who was able to hook up a laptop and reset the computer.  When I restarted the car the faults were gone and the power steering worked!
It is now August.  Yesterday the exact same thing happened, loss of power steering the the above faults returned.  I took a peak at the battery terminal and it is corroded over again!  This time it didn’t crack, so a good cleaning should suffice.  I spent several hours cleaning the terminals with battery cleaner and a wire brush mounted on a Dremel tool.  I took the car back to the Ford dealership and got a lot of disbelief from the guys at the shop.  Of course, Santa had gone back north for the winter not to return for several weeks.  After much debate, I agreed to leave the car for diagnostics ($85).
Ford called back and wants to replace the entire steering gear which has the EPAS motor mounted to it for $1800.  I’m pretty sure that they just need to reset the computer (a 3 minute job) so I’m having a hard time agreeing to drop that kind of cash. So, the questions are as follows:

Was my initial fix a good fix?
Why don’t these faults clear automatically when the problem is cleared (assuming my battery fix was correct)?
How do I go about getting my computer reset?
-Do shops other than the dealership have the ability to do this?
-How much does the equipment cost to do this myself/what would I need?
If you’re still on the original battery, it’s probably about 5 years old by now
I’d consider getting a new one, then make sure the charging system is fine
Why are you so sure that the steering gear isn’t faulty?
Why are you so sure their diagnosis is wrong?
There is no such thing as a 3 minute job . . . you spend a few minutes talking to the service writer.  He writes up a repair order.  It goes to the dispatcher.  Then the mechanic gets it.  He has to find the car in back lot.  He does his thing (whatever that may be), then he submits the repair order, so that it can be closed.  He parks the car in the back.  The porter washes the car.  The cashier calls you over, so that you can pay.  Another porter drives the car to the service driveWitth the battery terminals coroding so fast, I’d think that the battery is off gassing much more than normal. With the age of the car, I’d replace the battery and have the charging system checked to be sure it is not overcharging.
YosemiteThe rapid corrosion can be caused by a bad seal at the battery post or even a cracked battery case near the post…But I don’t think that’s causing the power-steering problem…
The laptop Santa used was probably a service tool used to update and reprogram the E-prom in your cars computer (the BCM) That trick may have worked once but it’s not likely to work again…The fact is, todays electronic marvel cars can be a nightmare for repair technicians. Automotive technology is advancing so fast, nobody knows how to fix them anymore…They are trained to isolate the defective part and replace that part…http://www.aboutlawsuits.com/ford-focus-fusion-steering-class-action-67309/ 2.5k  they can deny and lie, but the lawyers are coming!Thank you all for your comments.  I’d like to continue the conversation by answering some questions and asking some of my own.
First, I will definitely be getting a new battery.  I certainly agree that it is the cause of the quick corrosion.
Obviously, I can’t be 100% sure that the steering gear isn’t faulty and I won’t completely rule out the possibility till the problem is fixed.  The issue is that I had the same symptoms (no power-steering and associated indication on the IPC) and the same broken part (corroded battery terminal).  Good troubleshooting practice would indicate that if that if the symptom is the same and the same broken part is found, it’s very likely the same problem with the same fix.
The other reason I have doubts is that the first time I went in to the shop none of the mechanics even knew how to do the reset.  Santa had to come out and even he, with all his experience, didn’t really know what to do.  We went through the faults together (the list extended well beyond power steering which would indicate that more than just the power steering gear is bad… like there is a power problem) and I had to coach him to do a reset.  So, I don’t have much confidence in the shop.
I don’t really have much experience with these computer scan tools which they are using on my car since I obviously don’t own one.   Caddyman indicated that it’s not likely to work a second time.  Why is that?  What is being reset?  Is it a main computer that holds the codes, or is it pulling codes from multiple components?  Also, does anyone know where I can get/use one of these tools?
Thank you again for your comments and suggestions.Car talk community,
I have an update and a fix!  I went in to the dealership to pickup my car and the mechanic had downloaded and RESET the faults.  The problem is gone!  Power steering works an the indications on the IPC are gone.  I had the service rep hook up the computer and it isn’t showing any faults.
I will post again if it comes back but I think if I change the battery and keep that battery terminal clean I should be good-to-go.It would seem the Electronic Power Steering uses, among other parts, an Electronic Control Unit . The service tech must have accessed THIS unit, a stand alone control box, and reset it. Before this, it must have been in some sort of failure mode triggering your dash light and shutting the system down. Ford probably figures it’s better to shut the system down then allow it to operate if the system detects some sort of failure…
Did the bad battery connection ever prevent your car from starting?  Any other electrical problems?  A long shot…A bad diode (rectifier) in the alternator can allow A/C ripple into the electrical system and THIS can cause ALL KINDS of problems with electronic components…A/C ripple is easy to test for, an alternator test will spot it instantly…I hope this “reset” results in a permanent fix…I tink your problem will be back, in which case I would replace the battery and terminals if not the whole cable, then find Santa to reset it again for you.It’s been two weeks with no problems.Over a month with no problem.I’m glad your problem is fixed.  The NTSB is now investigating this problem.  You are lucky they fixed it.  Most of the time Ford and the dealers are saying they know nothing about the problem.I am having the exact same problem with my 2010 fusion. Had to jump the battery the other day. And as soon as I stopped it and restarted it…steering assist fault and the traction control error came on and no power steering at all. Don’t have the cash for big repairs either.Replacing a dead battery isn’t a big repair.This happened to us this morning…we took it to the Ford shop immediately…there is a recall on power steering and waiting for them to get back with us regarding this recall. I will update as soon as I hear back from dealership.This happened to my 2010 Fusion today. Have you heard anything regarding a recall? ThanksI haven’t heard anything about a recall.My 2013 Ford fusion hybrid had this happen to me yesterday. No other issues. No warnings.Coming up on 4-years later and still haven’t had any problems… I’m going to say it was a good fix.Mine is now doing the same thing all they had to do was clear codes?",,,,

A portable garage would be even better, if you have room.Out of the sun as much as possible would help a bit but that falls in line with NYBo’s comment. The sun here in OK cooks a lot of it as I’ve seen 3 or 4 year old cars with the paint oxidizing or flaking no matter the make and model.The last paint protection I used and trusted was Liquid Glass. Now gone and I can find anything that I really trust.

That is probably the way I will have to go.

I don’t use a car cover, but I do use covers on lawn furniture, my smoker, and my gas grill. These items get a lot of condensation, and can require significant cleaning to remove the gunk that grows on them.Thanks,

Go to the Auto Geek web site and you will find all kinds of stuff to use.  Also it seems that a web search for Liquid Glass will bring up something .Will do. Most of the places that use to carry Liquid Glass are sold out and the guys I know that have some won’t part with it.
Al
it looks like Liqui Tech Finish First is the Liquid Glass successor, even bottle looks the sameThanks, that is the type of product I have been looking for. I know the sun is a killer on paint in the South, but I am looking for any thing that would come close to Liquid Glass.

42,95 Dodge 3500 Ram Van 65k - severe roof rust - replace entire body shell? Discuss,Maintenance/Repairs,12,328,"I own a 1995 Dodge 3500 series 1-ton Ram wagon (Basically a Ram Van with windows), 5.9L V8, ABS brakes,  in great mechanical condition all the way around, very low miles (65k).  I’ve done a lot to keep it perfect mechanically (new 3 row copper radiator, new water pump, rebuild rear axle which was mis-assembled at the factory, refit with rebuilt front calipers that use steel pistons not plastic which deform at high temps, straighten & re-weight driveshaft, new u-joints, new brake lines, new rear brake drums that are not out of round, straight & true 8-lug wheels, class 3 tow hitch, Wired in a better, more standard switch for the overdrive lockout, etc etc).
I’ve had it for years but when I moved to Florida the roof started rusting out uncontrollably.  I tried everything, nothing stops it.  Rust is severe.  I could possibly swap the engine & trans into another van with a better body but 95 is  funny year for engine electrical - I’ve seen many van engine swaps which have failed because of this - plus this is not a typical engine swap - entire nose cone must be removed, intake manifold has to come off. etc. plus every other system on the donor body vehicle will need going through as these tend to have 200k-300k miles on them now (front end, steering, A/C etc in my van are still perfect).
I have seen a garage once lift off the entire body shell of a Ford full size van (insurance job) and that seems like it might be the ‘easiest’ solution if I can find a good rust-free donor van body and a (cough) CRANE.  Has anyone ever done this?
Even replacing the roof with a fiberglass top (good luck finding one now plus they aren’t cheap) won’t work because rust is down into the pillars and front windshield all along the top.
If I had money I’d just buy a new van - but I don’t.  I bought this for $4300 in 2002 with 36K on it in dry sunny California (shoulda stayed there).  Anyone ever done this?  I can’t weld but I am handy with a wrench.
P.S. - Me-thinks this would be an excellent opportunity to replace the bad fuel sending unit assembly in the fuel tank and maybe create / install an ‘access door’ in the van floor over that area to deal with that recurrent issue in future.
Thanks much.What I would do with a vehicle this old is, treat the rust.
Apply a primer to the roof, and wrap the roof with a color that matches the vehicle.
Laying Vinyl on Van Roof
TesterA self etching primer is best for rust due to high zinc content.Sand it,prime it and put a wrap Tester talked about.Let me try again to explain how severe the rust is:  There are several rust holes the size of softballs in the roof.   The metal is rusting from inside out under the paint.  The metal is also very soft and flexes, so bondo or fiberglass just keep breaking apart.  I have literally flex taped the roof going over the holes and layers of silicone caulk everywhere.  It still leaks badly when it rains in spite of my best efforts.  The entire top of the front windshield track is compromised and water pours down the inside of the windshield when it rains.  I have painted the exterior several times over the years with rustoluem white and a foam roller and brush after using ospho and a wire brush (ospho did nothing it seems)  (I mentioned I’m not rich, right?)   so I have made every effort I could to stop the rust.  That is NOT going to happen.  We are way past that.  The rust is down into the window pillars (all of them) and there is no drip rail left in may places.   The entire lower section of the vehicle is 100% rust free.  I will try to upload some pics (I did not know I could do that )Honestly I NEVER in a milion years would have considered a vinyl wrap - will a wrap really work over holes the size of softballs??   What should I use as a base underneath?  Is the vinyl wrap tough enough to handle the sharp edges from the disintegrated drip rail?  Can the wrap do anything about / come forward enough to handle the compromised windshield seam along the top?  Can it actually overlap and cover the top part of the windshield itself somehow?  if so, can the wrap be drawn tight enough against the windshield for water to not be driven under the wrap while driving in the rain at speed? I’m saying all this a little toungue-in-cheek because I can’t see this addressing all these issues - but I don’t know much about vinyl wraps - and i am running out of affordable options.One thing you may need to consider. If the body has as much rust as you describe, is it still safe to drive? Like in a collision or rollover?
Even if you somehow “repair” the rust… it’ll never be as structurally sound as when new. Just a thought.It’d be cheaper to replace it with another van.Well, yes,  I 100% agree that the van is currently unsafe in a roll-over,
and that starting over with a newer, better van would be great.
Please feel free to write me a check.  But in reality, I’d have to do a go-fund-me or something to replace the vehicle with something that won’t need $3k of work.
i DO understand that continuing temporary ‘fixes’ is potentially unsafe but I am ‘poor’ and cannot afford to replace the vehicle.
That said, replacing the entire body shell with one that is not rusted is the solution I feel is best and safest if I can figure out how to do it and avoid pitfalls.  I’d appreciate it if we can talk about this and would like to hear from anyone who has done / attempted a body shell swap on a van (or other vehicle).
More details on the current condition of the roof re: safety concerns:  the roof sheet metal is bad yes.  The interior roof support braces running from side-to-side are still intact.  I have a fairly substantial (new) steel driver partition behind the front seats.  I’ve done what I can to try and preserve body integrity.  I simply cannot afford a new (or used) van that has equivilent low mileage and/or is in good mechanical shape.
Thank you.


 tcb_dj_162976:

“Does anyone have experience with replacing the entire body shell, lifting the old one off the chassis at the mounts and replacing it with a good one”. ?


No.
The B series vans have a unitized construction, the frame channels are welded to the body; “unibody”.I thought it was a body on frame!   Seriously it is a unibody???   I did not know this.  if that is the case then what I wish to do is simply not possible.Wow.  You are absolutely correct!
—>  ""the B-van was a unibody design, reinforced by two full-length open U-channels welded to the floorpan. It shared numerous components with Dodge trucks, but never used a true frame. “Like most unibody vehicles, it had a separate bolt-on front K-member to carry the front suspension, steering, and engine.”
i had no idea.
Well - it’s game over.   No hope of doing a ‘body-shell’ swap.
Thank you all for playing.
I guess I’ll just put some flex-paste and flex-seal on the roof and drive it until it disintegrates.
unless I can talk myself into doing an engine/ trans / driveline swap on a rust-free 1995 long wheelbase 3500 series 1-ton van body with a million miles on it
and then rebuild everything else.  (sigh)
well, at least now I know.

But no matter which way you go, it won’t be cheap.Learn to weld and form sheet metal. It will end up being cheaper in the long run. If you have to pay a fabricator, it will be more expensive. Let that guide you.",,,,
43,2008 Toyota Highlander Hybrid - AM radio static only in drive or reverse,Maintenance/Repairs,22,829,"AM Radio has severe static while in drive or reverse, noise stops when in park or neutral. Noise slightly increases in frequency with speed, but not dramatically. CVT transmission keeps engine RPMs somewhat constant so speed is not a direct correlation. I’m guessing it has a relationship to the electrical drive system or hybrid battery charging. Local dealer had no clue, other than to suggest the alternator.I think you’re on the right track. Something in the electric motor is causing static and it may even be an indication the motor is about to fail. Both times the alternator failed in my Corolla there was a noise in the radio. Find a good independent shop that knows hybrids or another Toyota dealer.Controlling the speed of the vehicle may involve pulse modulation techniques. Waveform pulses can generate all kinds of interference to other things. I would think that the engineers have designed proper filtering into the design to eliminate interference issues. The first thing to check is the antenna ground to make sure it is bonded to ground well. A faulty antenna ground will let noise like this get into the signal. If that is okay then I would make sure the ground wire shielding of the vehicle is working okay.I would be curious to see if a portable radio in the car also had static. If not, you might have a radio problem.  If it does have static, then you might position the portable at different locations to see if you can discover a source.You said you do not get static when you are in Park.  What if you rev it up in Park?Any difference in static while moving with the gas engine on vs. off?


 oldnotdeadyet:

You said you do not get static when you are in Park.


The fact that the radio noise only happened when the vehicle was “in gear” was what led me to suspect the interference was being caused by the electric motor.But only if the gas engine isn’t running.No difference when moving, whether gas engine running or not.AFAIK the electric motor is always engaged. In fact, at low speeds and in reverse it’s the vehicle’s main source of power. https://www.markville.com/how-hybrids-work/ After all, that’s how you get “regenerative braking.” Granted, it’s speculation on my part but I believe either the electric motor itself or something in the associated circuit is causing RF interference. When the vehicle is “in gear,” a circuit, a relay, something is energized whether the motor is running or not.It’s a hybrid - can’t rev it up it park. Throttle does nothing in park or neutral.I guess if I want to “rev” the system, I would need to put the car on jack stands.  Then, the portable radio on AM might be used to find the source.Thanks. That makes sense. Now, I just need to figure out if it is fixable bd/or if is going to lead to damage if not fixed. I don’t care about the radio, I care about the hybrid system.Gas engine can be running or not, same static.It is not a radio problem. Same static happens to a portable battery radio.Can you now use the portable radio as a detector?  Move the radio around and find out where the static is being generated.
This problem might be a simple as a bad capacitor in a circuit meant to filter noise.I’ll consider the portable radio for use in trying to detect the source of the static – not too wild about crawling under the car while it’s running and in gear, but I’ll figure out something safe.Duck tape your radio to a stick!  I agree, don’t crawl.What if it’s a problem with the car’s radio? It might not be anything wrong with the car.
Edit - never mind, missed the ‘happens with a portable’ post.AM Radio , they still have that ?  I thought everyone was using Satellite , FM or Ipod for music now.",,,,
44,Canadian speed control,General Discussion,28,887,"

I seem to remember that something like this was tried and it was stopped because of Morons using the fake patrol cars for target practice . The authorities were concerned that the actual patrol vehicles might be shot at.Several years ago, in my town, they began parking a real Crown Vic patrol car near certain intersections, on a rotating basis.   If one had the chance to look closely, there was a mannikin of some sort behind the wheel.    With the locals, this trick only worked for a very short period of time, until word got around.
It would probably be effective with folks from out of town, however.Noticed that in Florida last year.  The same Sheriff’s car was parked in the same spot on the highway day after day.  Then realized it was empty.  They didn’t even bother to put a dummy in it.  Maybe that worked for Floridians but us northerners caught on pretty quick.  I expected to see the car up on blocks with the wheels stolen.The state police in Maryland park a SUV at the end of work zones. The hood is often up and there is a speed camera in front of the truck. They double the fine if you are busted for speeding in a work zone, and often don’t reduce the speed in the zone, just actually enforce it.


 Bing:

Yes, it does work… because the patrol cars have illegal tint on the windows. Darker than the allowed limit of 33% (I think…).  From the side you can’t see it, from the front, you sometimes can see in depending on the light. There was an empty sheriff’s car parked on my street to discourage speeders.A few years ago, I was driving on Loop 1604 in San Antonio and noticed a Crown Vic parked under every overpass.  I looked close and noticed they were unmanned.
There was one intersection where only the left lane could turn left but a lot of people turned left from the right lane to cut in front of the people in line in the left lane.  One day, I noticed a “homeless man” talking into a cell phone at that intersection.  He was calling in license plate numbers to police and there were about four or five cars pulled over getting tickets for illegal left turns.  The next day, he was there again and obviously some people never learn.  But it did convince a lot of people to wait their turn in line, which moved a lot faster when people weren’t constantly cutting in front of the legal left turn makers.  It was one of those times when I was glad to see a law enforced as I gave a big “thumbs up” to the cops pulling those jerks over.


 B.L.E:

It was one of those times when I was glad to see a law enforced as I gave a big “thumbs up” to the cops pulling those jerks over.


Back in my days of commuting to work, there was an intersection where I had the misfortune to encounter the same jerk multiple times.   I would be in the left turn only lane, he would be in the right turn only lane, and he would always cut in front of me to make a left.
The first time, I figured that he had simply lost his way, but when he pulled that shtick the next time a day or so later, I knew that he was a cheater.
Luckily, after a few months I didn’t see him anymore, and I think it was probably because he was T-boned by somebody at that same intersection.

Years ago when I just got back from Nam and stationed at Ft Campbell…one of the local towns would post a cop car with a mannequin dressed in uniform.

Yeah I traveled that stretch quite a few times and always blue lights ablaze.  Out of state drivers beware.  I kinda like the blue lights though used in the south.  Minnesota has gone to bright amber and red and they are so bright and blinding at night you can’t hardly see the road when they have stopped someone.I do not know if it is true or not but the story was in PA on the tollroad if you had too little time between toll booths they might give you a speeding ticket.It was true when I was still working don’t know if it still is.

45,Gift suggestion,General Discussion,20,633,"Hi, I’m sorry if I’m doing this wrong, I never use forums. My husband asked for a “creeper” for Christmas and I’m wondering what kind you folks like or recommend? He has a Fiesta ST if that matters. Plz help. Any and all other gift ideas welcome as well. Thank you.


 Solved by Nevada_545 in post #3 


                I prefer a creeper with a metal frame, I have broken several wood frame creepers.
              
This is a perfect case for using the only retailer that will be left someday .  Amazon has lots of those listed and with the reviews and prices you really can’t go wrong .I prefer a creeper with a metal frame, I have broken several wood frame creepers.Mine has the wheels placed in from the corners. This is not good because if you shift your weight to the edge of the creeper, it tilts and you tend to fall off. I’ve seen some with the wheels out away from the corners and this would be more stable.I like the Bone Creeper. It’s so comfortable I could almost fall asleep on it. Unfortunately, it seems it’s out of stock pretty much everywhere.
My second favorite creeper is actually one of the cheaper ones, at least if you get it at Harbor Freight:



Harbor Freight Tools 4



40 in. 300 lb. Capacity Low-Profile Creeper, Black 4
40 in. 300 lb. Capacity Low-Profile Creeper- Black





It’s also very comfortable and the wheels roll nicely. If there’s no Harbor Freight near you, the same creeper is sold under other brand names at other places like Amazon. Easy to recognize - they all look the same except for color and the brand name.I think he is a sweetie and you should get him a three-car garage with a hydraulic lift with a range of 48 inches minimum. After all, it’s Christmas!I put this gift request in the category of letting the person pick out the creeper himself .  I have had gifts of tools that I could not return fast enough . Once I got one of those screw driver sets and I only use 4 of them , plus the worthless electric brad nailer that required a hammer to drive the brad the rest of the way in.

Someone logged on just to post that I can’t say I actually know what they mean or why I would buy that  Truly came to ask you folks bc I just am very out of my element w car things but want my husband to be happy. I have always used a flattened cardboard box when I need to work under a car.  An actual creeper would reduce the clearance available for working, as well as the fact that I would be upset when oil gets spilled on it.  The cardboard box doesn’t cost me anything, and it absorbs any spills which might occur (within reason, of course).

Should she NOT give him that creeper, because you said a creeper will reduce clearance?

A good creeper can last a lifetime. I sometimes use cardboard and I enjoy the choice of using a creeper or cardboard.Other than the good creeper suggestions I might make this suggestion since he’s going to be underneath a car.
Buy him a good (meaning not Harbor Freight as there is a story on that) jack stands with at least a 3 ton capacity and hopefully a good heavy duty floor jack if he does not have one already. His life depends upon it and when under a car both should be used along with wheel chocks. Always keep it redundant. You might be surprised at how many people each year get injured or crushed to death from falling cars. Three in my area alone including a long time friend who ended up deceased in a heartbeat.
Of course there’s Option B. Take out a million in life insurance and buy him some Harbor Freight jack stands on the way home…           (Calm down, just chain yanking…) There is a fabric creeper.

46,Shaking when accelerating above 60mph - 2001 BMW X5 3.0i Auto,Maintenance/Repairs,6,315,"Hello,
We have begun to experience an unsettling shaking when accelerating above 60 mph. Here are some details:
The shaking feels mostly from the front end, passengers in the rear can barely feel it if at all. The driver and front passenger can feel it easy. My interpretation of the shake appears to come from the front right, but I can’t be certain.
The shaking occurs when using the accelerator pedal, above 60mph. Meaning, the pedal needs to be pressed roughly 10% down in order for the shaking to start, anything less and there is no shaking. For instance, just cruising with my foot lightly on the pedal and maintaining the same speed results in no shaking. Likewise, slowing down using the brakes produces no shaking.
The shaking is not felt as much in the steering wheel as compared to the floor and seats where it is quite prominent.
When we first started experiencing the shaking, it was always typically on road trips at higher elevations. Road trips at lower elevations and we never experienced it. Until recently, it began to show itself at all elevations.
We can get the shaking to occur at speeds below 60mph, say 40mph but only if going uphill or if having been driving for an extended period of time. Cold start 40mph up hill results in no shaking. But highway driving 60mph + will for sure result in shaking, again only while accelerating not coasting or braking.
I have hooked up the BMW reader as well as a run of the mill OBD2 and found no codes.
Here are the repairs we have had conducted so far, since the onset of the shaking:
All wheels balanced and checked at tire shop
Front Flex Disc
Rear Flex Disc
Engine Mounts
Transmission (transfer case) Mount
Replace Front Differential Fluid
Replace Transmission Fluid
Other items that have been completed since the onset of shaking, but not due to the shaking (in case this helps narrow things down):
Oil and oil filter change
MAF sensor cleaned
Intake air filter changed
AC tensioner and belt, accessory tensioner and belt, idler pulley
Power steering fluid drain and refill
ICV cleaned
DISA cleaned and upgraded
Casual inspection of the front end shows nothing obvious. CV boots are intact with no rips or traces of grease leaking.
The last works completed on the car before the shaking begun were about a year prior to the onset of the shaking, we did fuel filter and spark plugs. But then we drove the car around 10 months with no issues until the shaking began.
In typical car talk fashion, I want to further confound things by throwing out there that we also have a very noticeable vibration at idle, in gear. Park and neutral have no vibration, but drive and reverse produce a pretty jaw rattling vibration at idle. When put into gear, the RPMs drop from around 700 to around 650 if that helps. AC seems not to affect it, but turning on high beams does (while low beams are already on, turning on the high beams while in gear makes the vibration increase). Although annoying, I can forgive this for an 20 year old car.
It’s the shaking at highway speeds that has me worried it will leave us stranded in the desert or in the snowy mountains somewhere.
Thank you!I would say you might have two issues: the idle may be a idle air valve as the a/c being should raise idle by 75 to 125 rpm on your engine ( might be worth checking the compressor is cutting in if you haven’t already ) I’ve cleaned the idle valves sometimes with improvements and sometimes not.have you checked the front crank pulley is ok , try to pry it away with a bar, these were two piece joined by rubber and are a vibration damper.
The drive could be the front prop shaft uj at the transfer case end. Yours is also an early X5 so may have a basic transfer case or an atc unit, you can tell if the traction light on the cluster has just 4x4 or the rotating arrow.
Hope that helpsI’m going to leave the suggestions to the more experienced, but I must say this is the most thorough description of symptoms I have ever read. Excellent.Great write-up but how many miles are on this car?
The vibration seems to be an engine condition considering how much stuff you’ve changed.
Has the engine had a compression test? Has a mechanic ridden in the car with his scanner trying to capture and engine problem in real time?
But I’ll throw out a Hail Mary here, too… have the brakes been serviced anytime in that one year interval? Have any of the brake calipers been replaced? Have the brake hoses ever been changed?Thank you for the quick replies! Here are some follow-up answers.
I have indeed cleaned the idle air valve. When we changed out the belts and AC tensioner, accessory tensioner, and idler puller, I did check to see that the compressor was engaging with AC was on, and I think I have checked it again once since (we have a separate AC issue that I was going to ask about later on). I will go under soon and check the crank pulley. I’d hate for this to be the issue, but it might in fact explain both of my problems possibly… I don’t think the front shaft has a u-joint, but the back one does and I will have a look this weekend.
The car has around 120k miles. I have not had a compression test, nor done a scan while driving, but I will add those suggestions to my list. The vacuum lines were also replaced about 3 years ago. No brake service has been done recently, the fluid was flushed about 2.5 years ago (around time for another flush soon I suppose).
Thank you for the excellent suggestions and for giving me more insight into what I need to keep troubleshooting!is there the possibility of an ignition miss / spark plug miss / coil misfire?  High speed / under load could be some kind of an ignition issue.   That would cause the engine to shake but only under those conditions.  Are you / have you been getting ANY check engine trouble codes at all?  (is the check engine light functioning?  does it light up at self-test when ignition is switched to ‘on’ before starting the car?).  Compression should be checked but I would think if compression is bad then this symptom would be present in the entire range of driving & acceleration.  Last thing - make sure all the spark plugs are tight and all the way in.  I’m not an expert but I mention these things as no one else has so far.  good luck.Another thought - you mention that this is an automatic transmission vehicle - is there the possibility of locking torque converter clutch malfunction or slippage?   Acceleration under load should cause the locking T.C. clutch to disengage.  If it doesn’t disengage that could force an ugly vibration under load.    Again, I’m not an expert and am not sure how your transmssion is set up.",,,,

TesterYup, the only thing I will add is that they all are not screwed in.  Some are pressed/knocked/pounded in so you’ll ruin them taking them out.  I used to install zirks in wheels during my school years-lots and lots of them.Wow, that’s what I call advice. Much thanks, folks!",,,,
48,Transmission shudder quick fix,Maintenance/Repairs,8,1.3k,"my son recently took his 2001 ford pick up to a transmission guy after experiencing a shuddering when the gears shifted…the guy told him he needed a new transmission and when my son explained he was gonna have to come up with the cash first,he squirted some kind of lube into the trans and was told it would hold for maybe long enough to save up for the new trans…ever hear of this?Yes. LUBEGARD makes a product called SHUDDER FIXX http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snuBptokWLE 15 Perhaps that’s what he added.
Testerwow…thanks for that lightning fast replyI guess a lot would depend on exactly what was going on inside the bell housing to know how long of a fix he could hope for ,right?Maybe this trans guy knows his stuff and maybe not.  If he does not, a complete fluid change with Mercon V will probably fix this.  The TC probably has a drain plug.  If so, use it.  If you want to do it yourself look here.  Register and look in the Body of Knowledge forum.  Go to a good independent trans shop if you don’t want to do it yourself.  Remember, AAMCO stands for “All Automatics Must Come Out”.Maybe it was Lucas Transmission Fix. I’ve had good luck in the past with shifting problems on disposable cars.Ok lets find out what might be fixable first. When was the last tuneup? Is the engine running steady or a bit off. The engine control and a poor spark can cause issues on shift and they are easier to start with than a trans rebuild. Newer engines even in trucks have issues with power control systems that can cause this. Just putting in lube fix may not fix it because a poorly running engine can balk at a shift. How many miles?It does come highly recommended. Even my Transmission guy loves it.  No luck with my shudder in my Grand MarquisNote this is an 11 year old thread but that is quite common.
Before blaming the transmission I might suggest dropping the driveshaft and checking the U-joints. It’s often thought that U-joints can be checked on the car as they will be loose to some degree. Not so in all cases.
The grease dries out over time, the needle bearings start to slide instead of roll, and they develop flat spots on them. With the shaft out and the joints rotated by hand those spots cause binding which can be easily felt.
It’s been my experience also with 3 of my Fords that they are a bit particular about fluid changes. Lack of those changes can cause converter shudders; a.k.a. the rumble strip effect.",,,,
49,Motor replaceed no crank,Maintenance/Repairs,13,396,"Aftern replaceing motor in a 2002 highlander i have a no crank condition where im not getting power to the 7.5amp started fuse. i have power on 3 of the 4 pins on the starter relay, and good battery voltage… all power in the dash works windows work lights and blinkers work but no power to the white wire with red chaser to the starter. Also i am not hearing the fuel pump engage.Which end of the white wire did you test?  If it’s at the starter, try the other end. If the end away from the starter isn’t getting power, check the connector that plugs into the starter circuit.

The blue/white wire should be grounded, if there is power on that wire you have a problem with the park/neutral switch or the end of the wire is not grounded. The ground location for the 4 cylinder engine is on the left side of the cylinder block.If you have power on 3 pins when attempting to start you are lacking ground on the actuator circuit.its the 3.0l v6 sorry i should have speified it …also all wheel driveThe ground wire is located on the intake manifold plenum, likely on the back side near the fire wall.with jumoing the red white wire direct to the batter the fuel pump iengagesFor the starter relay to operate properly the blue/white wire needs to supply a ground signal; the transmission must be in park/neutral, the wiring must be connected to the park/neutral switch, the harness ground must be connected to the manifold.It’s possible that the transmission gear selector and neutral safety switch was disconnected and never reconneted.i believe i have all ground connected and all connectors connected… the transmission selector wont go into gear without using the little button under the cover for when tow truck operators have to use the selector without a key

I currently drive an 89’Volvo wagon that I won’t get rid of. Just looking for another great Volvo! Thank you for your help.I really can’t see that anyone can make that decision for you .  You like those old Volvos and it is your money . After seeing and driving it I might even think that price is acceptable. As for problems , who knows , not even your local fortune teller can answer that.You couldn’t pay me to take away an expensive to own/maintain/repair luxury European vehicle that’s also 33! years old. Finding parts could be an issue, the safety equipment while state of the art at the time is nothing compared to a car that’s even just 10-15 years newer. If you insist on purchasing this thing, pay your mechanic to do a prepurchase inspection on it before you buy it. I personally think that $2,000 dollars is nuts for a 33 year old car with almost 200k on the odometer for a car that isn’t a classic or special.You’d want your volvo mechanic to go over the car for you and give an idea of what shape it’s really in but it appears to be a decent car from the picture. Someone that works on these would be able to give you a better idea of what to look out for than I could. These do have a certain following among Volvo fans though.And part of the inspection needs to be an engine compression test.

Doesn’t seem to be a big leak but… Rather than have me say “OK you should buy his car” from one picture on the internet, why not spend a little money and have your mechanic check the car over before you buy it. Best $100-125 you’ll ever spend getting a hands-on inspection.
Good Luck.Thank you! I’ll take it to the mechanic.Make sure the mechanic knows it’s a prepurchase inspection. Ask for a list of things needed to get it past inspection in your state if you have one and then repairs that would be nice, but not necessarily needed immediately. Tires might be on either list. It it doesn’t need tires immediately, you might need them in 6 to 12 months. Adjust the price for wear items that aren’t quite worn out yet too.Possibly a torque converter seal also. No matter; any leak from the converter or rear main seal means that both should always be replaced.
For a comparatively young car with low miles it seems to be unusual for either one of those seals to be leaking at this point from age or miles.
That leads me to wonder if maybe the transmission has been out of the car before and someone maybe jostled the transmission a bit much during the reinstallation; leading to possibly damaging the seal.",,,,

Not just Toyota, by the way
You get the transmission fluid up to a specified temperature, then follow a procedure . . . varies based on manufacturer . . . to check the fluid level


 ArgosNoble:

You dodged a bullet there…I wouldn’t take my car to Iffy Lube to get air put into my tires…your local independent mechanic will know the proper procedure that @db4690  to check your transmission fluid level/conditionYeah. I dont trust them… they seem shadyIt’s been that way since at lest 2005. Just change tranny fluid every 50k miles and you should be all set. And do NOT let Jiffy Lube change your fluid. Find a good independent or transmission specialist to change the fluid and make sure they use the right fluid that meets the Toyota WS spec. Only a couple out there.


 ArgosNoble:

… and inept.
Asking one of the barely-trained kids at Jiffy Lube to check your trans fluid is the automotive equivalent of asking the cashier at CVS or Walgreens to diagnose your health.   Just the thought of allowing someone who received little or no training, and who is not a mechanic, to go anywhere near my transmission sends chills down my spine.

Some are, just like any business, including car dealerships and independent garages. With JL, it’s more that the oil jockeys have not learned their trade yet. This is often the first job a mechanic gets, and they still have a lot to learn. Unfortunately, they learn on your car. You might call that inept, but I’d call it uneducated.


 jtsanders:

You might call that inept, but I’d call it uneducated.


I call it poor management. They should not allow to that person to work on any vehicle unsupervised until they are properly trained. Most of the time these places will show them the extreme basics and then let them go on their own and hope things work out. To properly train them means time and money.  And they’re unwilling to commit either.As the saying goes, “Never attribute to malice that which can be explained by incompetence”.  Of course, I would never let a place like Jiffy Lube touch my car, but I don’t think they’re thieves or con artists–just incompetent.  Plus, I prefer to DIY oil changes, transmission fluid changes, etc. to know that I’m using the correct fluids and good quality filters.Quick lube places can’t afford much training before putting the employee on the oil change line. It seems to me that the foreman would follow after the crew and make sure the job is done right, rather than thoroughly train the to work independently.


 jtsanders:

Quick lube places can’t afford much training before putting the employee on the oil change line.


Can’t afford, or simply don’t want to pay for training?  I struggle to believe that the franchisees who operate these shops cannot afford to properly train the employees, but I certainly believe that they choose to keep costs down by not investing much into their staff.You will have to take it to the dealer , they have special dipsticks they can use.   Most still have the tubes that are filled with a plug .     If you can find an indy  that is familiar with how to check it   use them .


 vipergg:

HUH? With these new transmissions you really don’t need to check. Just change every 50k miles or so and you’re good. Still if you want to check it then there are procedures. and no need to take to dealer. Do a google search.



 vipergg:

. Most still have the tubes that are filled with a plug .


Most built since 2012 do NOT have a transmission dipstick.There are youtube videos and forum write ups on how to change the automatic trans fluid on your Camry. Either have to DIY or have a  reputable shop do it. This is one scenario that you might be better off at the dealership.You have to check the fluid level at a specified temperature
A scanner will tell you that . . . and there is also a somewhat complicated procedure which doesn’t require a scanner but isn’t written in the owner’s manual.  You need access to professional service manuals and procedures, though
And you also have to figure out a way to get the new fluid into the transmission
image800×800 74 KBThey are franchises, and depend on the owner to determine business practices. I used to get my oil changed at a local JL, and they did invest in employee training. The shop had a wall full of training certificates. I never had problems. They were limited. They used universal trans fluid, so I wouldn’t let them touch that. My new cars use fully synthetic oil, and the JL cost is way too high. They priced themselves out of the market, poor service had nothing to do with I.Where I live an entrepreneur set up his own quick oil Shane place and had a training program.  They only performed lube-oil-filter changes.  Checked and filled your tires, checked function of your lights and turn signals, period.  They informed you of any problems but did not even carry replacement bulbs.
Then he retired and sold his shops to a quick lube franchise company, everything changed, offering all sorts of bogus services.Didnt say they had dipsticks, i said  a lot of them still have the tubes where the dipstick went  , some do  not like the ZF 8 speeds .   I think the newer transmissions  have made  the simple process  of checking your fluid a lot harder than it needs to be  and you cant easily check the  fluid without an extensive process    and they expect you to believe the fluid if for  life fluid  .    Then if you can find anyone to do it  it is like $700 -800   to do it when it use to be $200 or less  .

55,Temp gauge inop,Maintenance/Repairs,3,176,"2008  Izuzu  Ascender   which is a GMC Envoy  with the 4.2 liter straight six in it .   Temperature guage was working and now it is down to the cold mark even after driving it for awhile.  I have scanned
the codes and the only code it pulled was a po128 code  which is usually  a thermostat .  I have never seen a stat cause the temperature gauge not to work so I am leaning more towards a coolant temperature sensor  .   In reading the LIVE data  off the scanner it does see that the temperature  is 170 degrees when started  so that is confusing .   I dont see any indication that the temp signal is dropping out or changing drastically .  The stat could be bad too , the car has 150000 miles on it  but I dont think that would cause the gauge not to work  as that is just a mechanical device with no ties to the cluster thus the leaning towards  the sensor.   In the last week it was intermittent , it would  work ok and slowly go up and other times it would stay down at cold and then suddenly go up to  where it should be.  Now it is down at the cold mark .  Curently no CEL though I anticipate over the next few starts I will probably see one .   Anyone seen this behavior   ?The temp gauge is a stepper motor driven by the electronic control unit in the cluster. It is not a mechanical gauge nor is it an electric gauge. They go bad. Rather a lot from what I read.



 vipergg:

If the engine is cold, the reading should be about the outside temperature… give or take since the sender doesn’t read very accurately at those temps. If you use an IR temp gun on the t-stat housing, it should read the same as the scanner live data. If it doesn’t, the sender is bad.The scanner reads the what the coolant temp sensor for computer is seeing.
If there’s a separate coolant temp sensor for the gauge, it could be bad.
TesterThink I found my answer .  This is my issue to a tee .   https://ricksfreeautorepairadvice.com/p0128-and-temperature-gauge-dead-gm-vehicles/ 2
If you get a P0128 code AND the temperature gauge is dead, head right for the thermostat. When a thermostat goes bad on a GM vehicle, the PCM sets a P0128 trouble code and commands the cooling fans to run and disables the temperature gauge. Don’t waste time trying to fix the gauge. First, replace the thermostat. If the gauge still doesn’t work, then you can start diagnosing that problem after you’ve cleared the P0128 code.",,,,
56,Is synthetic oil better than conventional oil in older cars,Maintenance/Repairs,47,1.5k,"Hi everyone, were going to get our oil changed at new place Valvoline. They say they have full synthetic or conventional oil. I think we  have always used a synthetic blend. We are thinking of using full synthetic but i read online that could make the engine leak in older cars. Our car is a 1993 grand marquis it only has 33 thousand miles. So i was wondering for the people here who have older cars like ours is it best to use full synthetic or convectional?

TesterSynthetic oils causing leaks on older cars is a myth.
Full synthetic is better than a blend which is better than conventional oil. All of them will work in older cars. Do you need full synthetic? Probably not. But it can’t hurt a 93 car. The harder you work the car, the better you should treat it.I have an old lawnmower I bought in 1992.  Its manual calls for straight 30 weight heavy detergent oil.  It was burning a considerable amount of oil, so as an experiment, I put full synthetic 10W-30 in the crankcase.  It cut the oil consumption by at least 75% for more than two mowing seasons.  About the end of this season it began using oil and has become hard to start even with a new sparkplug.  I can tell that the compression is low.  However, at my Rural King store, the house brand 30 weight I had been using was $1.79 a quart.  The full synthetic 10W-30 was $2.79 a quart.  For the extra dollar I paid for each of the two quarts of oil I used for almost three seasons for changing the oil and for adding oil, I got three more years from the mower.
I think the 4 hp Briggs and Stratton engine on the mower would be just as hard on oil as a liquid cooled car engine.  I would think the car might benefit from synthetic oil.With an oil question you’ll probably get all kinds of different opinions expressed.  All of my cars are at least 10 years old and I religiously use full synthetic without any problems or leaks.  It gives me peace of mind.  Of course, I also snap my fingers to keep elephants away and that seems to work as well.  Others here will swear by simply using what has worked for you in the past, which also seems to be good advice if you’re not experiencing any issues with your current blend.  With so few miles on the car, the frequency of the changes is just as important, if not more so, as the type of oil.  A chain place like Valvoline probably has more of a vested interest in upselling to full synthetic as opposed to an independent shop, so you might be better off by simply sticking with what you’ve done so far.  If it ain’t broke don’t break it.I go to  valvoline instant oil change for my NY State annual inspections. I do not go there for anything else. They try to sell me cabin and air filters, all sorts of miracles in a can, transmission and oil conditioners, fuel service treatments you just pour in the tank and their oil changes are more expensive than my dealers.
when my car was 4 years old they told me my battery tested weak and was in danger of imminent failure.  They told me that3 years in a row, in the third year that I had a broken battery post.  Amazingly my 9 + year old battery must have healed itself because they have not mentioned it in two years.  They might just be embarrassed because every time I go, if they don’t bring it up… I do.Flip a coin. It makes no difference.I’ve been using synthetic in my '95 for a few years now. It’s almost the same price as conventional now at Walmart. $16 vs $14 for 5 quarts. You still get varying opinions about negative side effects. I haven’t noticed any.

You need a specialized oil filter when using synthetic oil or you won’t get its full benefit. Putting synthetic in a 25 year old car is a waste of money.

 COROLLAGUY1:

Those “special filters” are only necessary if you’re trying to extend the interval of the oil change, which I certainly would NOT recommend the OP do on a 1993 vehicle (or really any other car that doesn’t specify a longer oil change interval)I never heard of specialised oil filters for synthetic. Some claim higher change intervals. I use low priced ones and change at 4 or 5k.


 pyrolord314:

Those “special filters” are only necessary if you’re trying to extend the interval of the oil change


Almost every modern cars  built today comes in with a cartridge oil filter made for full synthetic oil.Then, you must drive an antiqueYes better especially under certain certain conditions. Required no.
Synthetic not required in my snow blower or generator but pull starting them can be painful if outside  in cold temps.
Most important factor is checking your oil level followed by changing at a reasonable interval. The interval can generally be stretched with synthetic however generally the oil level needs to be checked more at end of said interval whether new or old vehicle.Lol yes it is technically considered an antique vehicleA good question would be, can you extend your change intervals with synthetic in an older car and how much. If you can’t extend the intervals, then is it just a waste of money.If it ain’t  leaking I’d keep using the blendIn the case of my Corolla, its suppose to improve fuel economy.The car is using 0W-20.  Oil will get brownish around 5000k miles or so but I will sometimes stretch the oil change intervall a bit. At $70 CDN it is expensive.",,,,

Following turning off the jeep for about 15min or more I return and the Jeep wont start, the engine turns over but wont start. Following cranking for a few min it will finally sputter and start. Thanks for the help I appreciate your help.
BobCarry a bottle of water in the Jeep.
The next time the engine won’t start, open the hood and pour the bottle of water over the fuel rail(s).
If the engine starts after doing this, the problem is vapor lock.
TesterDealt with this on my similar Jeep, it is especially bad on the 4.0L engines. They sell a heat shield kit for this problem, I am not sure as to how effective it would be though.tks…what is the problem you mention??? what will the heat shield protect?You want to have the fuel pump tested for residual fuel pressure.
Residual fuel pressure is the pressure that remains in the fuel system after a hot engine is turned off.
This pressure prevents vapor lock from occurring, so the hot engine can be restarted shortly after it’s turned off.
To prevent fuel percolation and aid hot- and cold-engine starting, fuel injection systems must maintain residual, or “rest,” pressure when the engine is off. All systems lose residual pressure over time. It’s just a question of how fast and how much before it’s a problem.
Since the entire supply side of the fuel system is normally pressurized, a loss of residual pressure could be caused by a leaking injector, pressure regulator or fuel pump check valve. Determining which involves isolating various parts of the fuel system, saving you the trouble of visually inspecting each component.
TesterIn my situation it was what Tester suggested (the “vapor lock” or “heat soak”) but it was also my fuel pump was going out. The heat shield I suggested is found all over. Here is a link to one on Quadratec. https://www.quadratec.com/products/17604_1031.htm?gclid=Cj0KCQiA48j9BRC-ARIsAMQu3WTJd16TBdIs8BOCXTUcMWyFvjJZiLf6d-zS3nsAljTiDhp04hj5-DAaAqAdEALw_wcB 4tks for the info…

BobTester…Thank you for that reply…i just saw it. It make the most sense to me.If lack of fuel or low fuel pressure are the cause of the non-start, the “key dance” is worth a try: turn key to Run (not all the way to Start) and the fuel pump should run for a few seconds. You may hear it. Turn it Off then right back to Run. Each time you are getting fuel and fuel pressure up to the engine. After a few of these steps, turn the key all the way to Start. Good luck!",,,,
58,How was my 2010 Ford Mustang stolen?,Maintenance/Repairs,17,578,"My car (2010 Ford Mustang GT Premium) was stolen and recovered but when we got it back the steering column was not broke and I do not understand how they stole it. We forgot to lock the car door the night it was stolen but we have the keys.Tow truck, maybe.I don’t know if this has any bearing but when I drove for a very large trucking company, every International Harvester in our fleet had the same key. It also fit my 972 International Cub Cadet riding mower and when I started driving a school bus in 1995 it fit all the international school buses in our fleet, even though the keys from those buses were not interchangeable with each other.I seem to remember reading somewhere that there really were not that many different key combinations.  On the other hand there are devices used to pick locks that work pretty fast.  Of course if there is a security system who knows?  I used to have a guy at work that was with the OSS during WW II.  When someone locked their desk or file and didn’t have a key, I would call on him to pick the lock.  He was a little rusty but was successful 75% of the time.


 Bing:

Of course if there is a security system who knows?


There IS a security system on the Ford. If you pick the ignition cylinder, or have a cut key that turns the lock, the car still won’t start since the proper security ID from the key is not coded into the instrument cluster. Yes, the instrument cluster stores that info.They’re using scanning devices that can pick up the code that’s being emitted from the key fob in your pocket or even sitting near your front door at home. That code can be beamed to a second repeater device being used by another person near your car. Since modern cars are designed to recognize a coded signal rather than just a specific key fob, the repeater can be used to gain entrance to your vehicle and even start the engine.So, a hi tech thief stole car and then abandoned it? With no parts lost? Why did they steal it?They don’t steal the car for car parts,they commit other crimes with it.They will abandon the car after they are done.In this case it might have been a joy ride in a Mustang GT.Another possibility is overseas shipping.

A nearby Nissan dealer lost a truck sale because they would not remove the tracking device, they even wanted me to pay them $300 for the thing.  I’m not having that.can you provide one confirmed case of that happening in the real world? because while i absolutely believe it is possible under controlled conditions, i find it nearly impossible to believe that a thief capable of this level of technological and manpower coordination is setting their sights on 10-year-old cars.that would be my guess. is there any damage or marks on the bottom of the car to suggest that it was lifted? I don’t know Mustangs all that well…I’m assuming it’s RWD? If so, they would just need to lift the back and it will roll right down the road.

60,Spark Plug Wire Arcing at Spark Plug Wire Boot and Ignition Coil Connection,Maintenance/Repairs,17,18.2k,"Continuing the discussion from Misfire… New wires arcing? 10:
I have a 2003 Pontiac Bonneville SLE and my check engine lights come on for periods of time…Sometimes it blinks on and off when accelerating or going up a hill…Autozone pulled a P0300 CODE which means random number 3 cylinder misfire…What is funny about this situation sometimes the car run smooth and then sometimes it don’t with the sputtering and acceleration problems…Yesterday I was able to see clearly the spark plug wire arcing right at spark plug wire boot that connects to the number 3 part of the ignition coil…Can this be a bad number 3 spark plug, #3 spark plug wire, #3 Ignition Coil Assembly and Ignition Condrol Module??? Or all parts above??? I am not that mechanically incline but if it is just a bad Ignition Coil that need to be replaced I can do that myself…What can this means spark plug wire arcing at the ignition coil and the #3 spark plug wire boot connection??? Please advise…The root cause is usually a misfiring spark plug.
Over time a spark that is jumping can damage the plug wire or coil boot as the case may be.
With the spark plug out I would advise running a compression check on that cylinder. Low compression can cause a plug to misfire which in turn, yada, yada, yada.
Hope that helps.Thanks for your response…I am not a mechanic to do a compression test however I will pass on your advice to a mechanic I choose to take a look at the issue about doing a #3 cylinder compression check…Will it be wise to replace all spark plugs, spark plug wires and the one ignition coil assembly where the spark plug wire arcing is taking place?


 Tone1873:

Will it be wise to replace all spark plugs, spark plug wires


Yes, if one set of wires is starting to arc, odds are the others aren’t long behind itYes,change them…thats an easy doityourself project. All you need to do is identify where all the wires go.Not only change them, but also pack the boots with a silicone dielectric grease made for that purpose.  It will help prevent future arcs, preserve the boots and sometimes will prevent arcing if the coil tower is cracked, which often happens when arcing has occurred for a while.Thanks I will do just that…Replace them all at the same time. And pack the boots with the dielectric grease.I would do the wires one at a time too, just to make sure you don’t cross up the connectionsYou are going to do plugs too aren’t you?
A little coil theory here if you don’t mind.
A connection is made to apply 12vdc to a coil.  Current starts to flow but it is opposed by the induction of the coil.  The voltage slowly overcomes the induction and more current flows.  Current flow increases with time.  At higher RPMs, it may only have 1/5000th of a second (200 microseconds) to build up, but in electrical time, thats a lot.
The current only flows through the primary of the coil which has fewer windings so it has less inductance so current flow builds quicker.  As current builds up in the coil, magnetic lines of force build up around the coil.  It is the build up of these that causes the inductance.
Now when the engine needs a spark, the connection that started the current flow is opened.  When this happens, the magnetic field begins to collapse.  The collapsing field cuts across the windings of the coil and when a magnetic field moves around a conductor, current is induced to flow.  When the field collapses, it not only cuts across the primary windings, it also cuts across the secondary windings inducing current in those as well.
There are about 100 times as many secondary windings as there are primary windings.  That alone would cause the voltage induced to be 100 times greater than the applied voltage, but there is more.  There is also a time factor involved in that the field collapses many times faster (1.2 - 4 microseconds) than it builds up because of the extra resistance caused by the spark plug.  So not only does the voltage go from 12vdc to 1200 v pulse, it an rise as high as 40,000 volts.
The voltage is determined by Ohms Law.  I wont go into that but basically, the higher the resistance in the secondary circuit (coil + wire + plug), the higher the voltage.  If the plug doesn’t fire, usually around 26,000 volts, then the voltage will go higher until it can find a path.  It can jump from a weak part in the insulation of the wires or boots or it can arc internally in the coil, damaging it.
This is why it is important to change the plugs as well, and to always change them according to the maintenance schedule.I would only add that only the correct plugs should be used. That info may be on an underhood sticker or in owners manual.Here’s something that nobody else mentioned . . . as far as I know
Carefully check the coil tower(s) . . . they do sometimes wear out, which results in a poor fit, and often a misfire
Make sure the wires are in good shape . . . boots and insulation.  I wouldn’t be surprised if the insulation is breaking down and arcing to ground, if they’re still the original parts
Considering the car’s 15 years old, it’s probably due for plugs by mileage, anyways.Unless the spark plug gap has become really wide, my guess is the same as db’s above, there’s a bad connection between the coil and the top of the spark plug. Or the coil itself is shot.Thanks everybody for your responses much appreciated…

yep , and be sure to recheck those battery connections. a loose battery cable connection can cause these kinds of issues.Check those battery terminals and cables as mentioned. While it is seldom considered a regular maintenance item, I clean the terminals on my cars about every other year just to avoid problems.
And a year old battery means nothing. I put a new battery (120  bucks/3 year) in my Lincoln in January of 2019.  In February of 2020 that battery died and died badly. After 13 months I figured no big deal but it turned out to be one.
WM gave me another battery under warranty but they say the replacement for that 3 year battery carries no warranty at all. So today in December of 2020, a mere 10 months later, the battery they gave me last February has also decided to go to heaven. There’s no ambiguity or doubt about it. All night on the charger/maintainer and a measly 7 volts is the best it can do.
I’ve used WM batteries for several decades with no issues but this deal has kind of soured me a lot on them.
The worst example was a Die Hard that went totally south the day after I bought it.I figured it out. Was a bad cable. I was freaking out because I had to be in two different places the next day. Appreciate your input. Stay safe.
Andrew W.Where can you buy a Die Hard…I had to go to Advanced Auto. A platinum series   or something to get something close for my ol’ Crown Vic. The original Die Hard went over 16 years with way over 200,000 miles on it!Advance Auto may be the only place- I’ve seen some commercials advertising that the DieHard brand is now at Advance (commercials starring Bruce Willis reprising his “John McClain” character form the Die Hard movies!)
But… know that the DieHard battery name was sold off as part of the liquidation of Sears.  The manufacturer is most undoubtedly not the same as it was in your old DieHard battery- and even if it was, 16 years is an unheard of amount of time for a battery to last.

65,Hydroplanning,General Discussion,10,409,"I’m wondering about my car i heard it has good tires for now a month ago but, I think its ready to change them because when I go from a stop sign my power wheel doesnt grip the road and i think its spinning out on it. I go to second gear cus its manual and it works im confused if thats hydroplanning. It happens when it rains so it could just be the oil and water but, why does it grip on second gear but, not first??What’s the tread depth of these tires?Your car can apply more torque to the wheel in first than it can in second.  For winter driving you have to learn to use much less throttle.That is NOT hydroplaning.  That is just poor wet grip.
Hydroplaning is where your tire floats on a cushion of water - like water skiing…  This occurs at high speed and is caused by low tread depth, deep water, low inflation pressure, and  high speeds.
To fix YOUR problem, change tires, or use less throttle (in other words, drive gently.)No, that’s not hydroplaning.  You are just using too much throttle on take off on wet roads.  When shifting to second you are already moving.
Hydroplaning is when the tires are riding on the water and loose contact with the pavement, this happens at speed, not when standing still.
There are tires that have good dry traction, but lousy wet traction.  When you do buy new tires, go to tirerack.com  and/or consumer reports to research which tires have better wet traction.
You can Google hydroplaning to get a more in-depth information.


 Josue-2:

It happens when it rains so it could just be the oil and water but, why does it grip on second gear but, not first??



Notice how little change there is in power at different throttle openings when the engine in this chart is running at 1500 rpm and how much difference there is in power at different throttle openings at 5000 rpm.  If you are using a gear that has the engine turning 6000 rpm, you go from lots of power to engine braking as you close the throttle, resulting in skidding with both too much and too little throttle. This is why it’s easier to be gentle on the throttle in a higher gear.
When I have that wheelspin problem taking off in first gear no matter how gently I try to give it gas, the problem always goes away if I upshift to a higher gear.
Also, hydroplaning is not an all or nothing thing.  You can be almost hydroplaning with a wedge of water under the leading edge of the tire supporting a large percentage of your car’s weight but still have the rear of the contact patch in contact with the pavement, resulting in highly reduced traction.


 Josue-2:

I’m wondering about my car i heard it has good tires for now a month ago


You heard it has good tires , what does that mean and from what source ?   Do a web search on how to read the date the tire was made plus are they over inflated .  Old tires can become hard and not have the traction they should have .How old are the tires?  Older tires can harden, so even if they have a good amount of tread they can spin in wet conditions.Sure you’re not just slipping on the painted stop line? Something like 10 or 15 years ago I started noticing the paint they use for road markings (around my city, at least) seemed to get slipperier.  It also got easier to see in the rain at night, so I suspect whatever they put in it to make it more visible in bad conditions lowered its grip.Unless you state otherwise, I tend to think this might be a situation mentioned by texases; old tires with hardened rubber.
Many years ago I had a set of Kelly tires on my prior Lincoln and those tires had no traction even when new. The simple act of removing the foot from the brake pedal on a damp street would cause them to spin without even touching the throttle. On the highway with rain; forget about it as the car was a death trap. Those tires were gotten rid of PDQ.It’s a typical problem with, “generously powered” small cars.
The solutions are:


Replace the tires with “soft”,  “sticky” tires for better grip. The miles you’ll get is awful and the price is higher but you’ll love the handling. See Tire Rack reviews


Or be gentle on the throttle and clutch when launching.

67,Leaky BMW convertible,Auto Type/Class,5,221,"My wife has a beloved 2001 BMW 330i convertible she loves more than me, but that’s a separate issue. Hers was the last year before retractible hardtops,so she bought the option for a removeable by hand [not easy at all] hardtop, that twice a year we manage to take out of basement storage and put on or off. Abut 5 years ago she noticed some minor water issues with the hardtop on, so hse took it to the dealer, who redid the rubber seals on the top. That didn’t work, and the dealer then shrugged and said she ought to talk to some body work shops to see if they had any answers. They didn’t. We just installed the hardtop again for the winter, and now there are major leaks coming in at both front A pillars when it rains. For some reason there’s also water leaking into the trunk too. This doesn’t happen when the soft top is up and on, so we feel that the problem is related to the hard top, but we don’t know what to do next. The car has only 60,ooo miles on it, runs well, but water leaks are driving my wife, and derivatively me, crazy.The immediate solution is to use the soft top and leave the hardtop off until you figure it out.
I wonder if the hardtop is out of alignment. It may have gotten that way by long term storage without adequate support for the front and back. Without that support, it might twist or sag, even though it is a solid top. Also, when the dealer replaced the gaskets, did they do the interface gaskets on both the top and the mounting points on the windshield and rear body?


 jtsanders:

I wonder if the hardtop is out of alignment.


That would be my guess, too.  Maybe got tweaked on the trip from or to storage.  It wouldn’t take much.As far as water in the trunk:  my Miata required a replacement of the seals around the taillights. An easy, low cost job.Those hard tops require adjustments to be made to the fixing points on the car, there are special plastic gauges that are used to get the gaps. Any Bmw dealer should know that if there’s anyone there from that era.Though it would defeat the purpose of having a convertible, next summer leave the hardtop on, parked in the sun, it might realign itself.
At one time lifts were available to raise and lower removable hard tops.  These were attached to the ceiling of the garage.  Perhaps such a system is still available, this would allow you to ‘store’ the roof on the car.",,,,

I’ll chime in for jazz: Benny Goodman 1, Buddy Rich 1You can’t fix stupid !!!OK, back to cars and headlights.  I know that Minnesota has a maximum headlight wattage but I can’t believe there is minimum wattage.  Maybe there is a prohibition against parking light type wattage, I dunno.  For the same reason I defended the poor guy in Northern Minnesota that installed a gas can to try and stay mobile with his wreck, you have to give the guy some credit for his effort.  Two purposes, to be seen and see.  I’m sure the flashlight still made him visible as much as a cycle and other devices on the road.  Whether they where bright enough to enable him to see where he was going, is subjective subject to some evidence to the contrary, like swerving, driving way under the limit.  I understand it’s not conventional but he was attempting to meet the requirements, no?
I support the police but there are police jerks too.  I remember 50 years ago we were duck hunting with my uncle.  You can only have three shells in your gun and have to use a plug in it so that you can’t load more than three.  That night we were stopped by the game warden and he was going to cite my uncle for not having a “store bought” plug like the rest of us.  He had used a stick and he demonstrated to the guy how it did the same job.  After a fair amount of arguing he let us go.  Just says plug, not made in a factory.

70,Starting Problem and Vacuum in Gas Tank,Power/Fuel,5,18.6k,"Yesterday my 1996 Mercedes C220 would not start. It cranked like crazy but would not fire. Some things I suspect contributed: The gas tank was below 1/4 full. It was cold … about 25F. The night before I had put 140 lb. of sand in the trunk just before driving it about 15 miles home and parking it. My theory was that because of the weight of the sand and the low gas level, gas was not able to get to the fuel pump. So this morning I was going to put in a couple gallons of gas from my garage gas can. When I opened the gas cap there was a serious whoosh of air into the tank; there had been a substantial vacuum inside the tank. I put the cap back on, without adding any gas (the sand was still in the trunk), and the car started right up. Here’s my question(s): 1) Did the sand contribute in any way to the problem?; 2) Did the low gas level contribute?; 3) Did the cold weather contribute?; 4) Do I have a mechanical problem I need to take care of? Thanks.To me, the fuel pump should be able to override a vacuum in your tank.
But in theory, a vacuum in your tank would fight the flow of fuel out of the tank. The sand is a red herring. The low gas level creates a larger vapor space in the tank. The cold weather also creates a vacuum as the volume of the vapor space does not contract much to compensate for the decreased temperature and you can create a lower pressure system this way, because if the volume remains constant, then a decrease in temperature directly causes a decrease in pressure. These two things combined created a vacuum space in your tank (as compared to the outside air).
I still question though whether this should be able to fight against a fuel pump. They are designed to start the car under these conditions.
Bad fuel pump? Partially clogged fuel system could contribute to this? Anyone else have thoughts?A bad gas cap will create a vacuum in your gas tank. The fuel pump will pump fuel until the vacuum overrides the pumping action of the fuel pump. Replace the gas cap.This is a clear sign of a problem in the EVAP system, specifically the charcoal canister.
Your gas tank needs to breath in, to allow air to displace the gas pumped out and when the gas contracts during cooling, and out, because the volume in the tank inceases (1) whenn you fill it, (2) when the gas warms up in the sun, and (3) when  the fuel is agitated as you drive (agitated fluid takes up more volume). In order to allow it to breath while still preventing hydrocarbon molecules from getting into the atmosphere, it breaths ina and out through an activated charcoal bed. The component that contains this is called the “carcoal canister”. The charcoal catches hydrocarbon molecules in air that’s escaping the tank, and when you start the car a solenoid-operated “purge valve” and allows the HC to be drawn into the engine’s intake system and burned.
If the vent line to the canister becomes blocked or kinked, or if the charcoal bed becomes saturated with gas, the tank will be unable to breath in. A vaciuum will form in the airspace and the vacuume will prevent the pump from being able to pump gas out. It also places excess stress on the pump and can cause premature pump failure.
I’ve attached an “exploded view” drawing of my owne system just to illustrate the typical system. I don;t heva one specifically for your system, but I’m coonfident that it’ll be similarly constructed.

P.s. I am replacing my vvt solenoid this Monday along with oil change .Can the vvt solenoid (sensor to control oil in the engine) be causing missfire?Try swapping the fuel injector for #4 to another cylinder and see if it follows the injector.
It might be a sticking valve in that cylinder caused by a bad valvespring or gummed up valves. You won’t find that on a compression test. Remove the valvecover and take a good look at the valvesprings for #4.Thanks for the info.How easy it is to check the springs on a 4 cylinder engine?Pretty easy to check valvesprings. Remove valve cover and look for broken coils. Take a pry bar or screwdriver and compress the spring just a little bit. If takes less force than its neighbor on #3, that may be the one. Replacing a broken spring can be easy or hard depending on the engine. Not sure which yours may be.
Start with the fuel injecter swap, then check springs.Thanks a lot.Probably I ll have my mechanic swap the fuel injectors on Monday when I ll do my oil change and if that doesn’t move the error to another cylinder I ll try the springs my selfIf you are using a mechanic for oil changes and injector swap, I’d suggest maybe you don’t have the skills to check valvesprings. No offense intended, but it is far more difficult than an injector swap.No offense taken.For the oil change I use a mechanic because I don’t have the space and time and once he is a good man also he won’t charge me for the injector swap.As far as the springs if I decide to go there I might ask him if he has time and what will cost me for him to check them and if it requires a lot of time( so that means labour) I ll do some search see how difficult it is and try my own.I mean I know everything in a 2L 4 cylinder dohc engine it’s easier compare to other types of enginesDefine what is meant by “good” on the compression test. People come onto this forum all the time with claims of good compression when the reality is that the number provided is not good at all.
Good should be 180 and up.

You could have a failing valve lifter in #4, which is a bigger job.I haven’t swaped injectors yet but I am worried it’s not that because I have used the bg44k Wich I read and heard the best from among other cleaners.So if it was a dirty one wouldn’t 2 cans of that do the job already?So my understanding is so far if I ever buy a used car again and read with the obd2 a missfire just walk away … because it’s one of the codes it can be caused by million things Did some research and it’s  easy to change/check the fuel injectors on a 4 cylinder engine.One guy gave a tip to release the pressure from the line before I take them out.And if I am about to replace it(better be all four of them) dip the new ones in gas before I put them on so the seals won’t leak.Any other tips or something I would pay attention when removing/swaping/changing the injectors on my dohc engine?Also any tips or standard signs that I will see on a bad /clogged injector when I ll check it?You likely won’t see anything on a bad or dirty injector. Yes, replacing the set would not be a bad thing on a car that old.
You should probably have new O-rings to install on the swap injectors as the old ones are may tear when you remove them. You should lube the O-rings with a little motor oil or trans fluid, not gas, before installing them.thanks man i ll see what i can do and keep you posted

77,Wierd “Shake/Shift” 2005 Camry,Maintenance/Repairs,16,231,"2005 Camry.  I had 3 new tires put on the, 2 to replace worn tires and one to replace a defective (sidewall bulge) tire.
Now the Car feels like driving on a flat.  It will kind of fish tail, or slide back and forth.  It starts about 55 MPH and gets progressively worse (but just barely worse).  If you let go of the steering wheel it seems to “self correct”.  Meaning when it shifts to one side it will “shift” back, but it’s not overly jerking, more just “shifting” to one side or another.  And I can’t tell if it’s in the front of rear.  Steering is still tight.
Weirdly, it doesn’t always happen, but most of the time (75%-80%).
Thoughts, input, where to start?Oh, and the tire pressure is good.Replace that 4th tire.
I’d guess the 3 tires are a different size from the other 1.Different size because of wear?  Because they are all the same make and model that I have been using on that car for 8 years…Micheline Defenders.


 erikkfriberg_153193:

Different size because of wear?


Different size because of actually a different size tire. Look on the sidewall and make sure the numbers match. Specifically the numbers in the format  “205/65/R15”
I’d also ask how different in age are the 3 new tires versus the old 1.Worned suspension components can cause that also.With so many places advertising 3 tires for the price of four why would you only replace 3 ?  I wonder why the tire shop did not have you sign a form that you declined a purchase of four tires .First, make sure your lug nuts are all tight.
Did you get an alignment with the new tires? If not, start there, but also tell them that you’re having this issue and that you want all suspension components to be inspected thoroughly.
As already asked, how old is the tire that you didn’t replace and how much tread is on it?I purchased 3 tire because two were worn and the other was a warranty replacement.No, they are all the same size, make and model.


 erikkfriberg_153193:

Right there, this tells us that you are not in the habit of rotating the tires as per Toyota’s maintenance schedule.  If you had, all 4 would wear at approximately the same rate.
Just how old is that one remaining old tire?As far as suspension, I have replaces the rear struts and hub assemblies in the last 2 years.  Where in the suspension should I start?


 VDCdriver:

I didn’t know I was under interrogation and going to be insulted on here.  Thank and merry Christmas to you too!!!
I do rotate the tires regularly.  But they weren’t initially not replace at the same time by someone before me, and I don’t see the need to spend the money that is not in my budget to replace good tires.
So unless you are going to pay for my maintenance, or at least be helpful, move on.


 erikkfriberg_153193:

Didn’t insult you, or didn’t mean to. @VDCdriver as looking for confirmation of non-rotation. (rhymes!)
If you are not rotating the tires, they develop wear patterns unique to their corner. The replacement does not develop the mirror image wear pattern and this alone can cause what you are feeling.


 erikkfriberg_153193:

I didn’t know I was under interrogation and going to be insulted on here.


You can take questions meant to understand the issue and help you any way you want. I only saw one response above that I would consider close to insulting.
The old tire might be worn enough that there is a significant difference in the outer diameter. A quarter inch of wear is heavy but not uncommon, and you need to double that to see the difference in diameter. Rubber in old tires is also harder than in new tires. If the shop that replaced the tires didn’t fill the remaining old one with air, that can also be part of the issue. Up to a half inch difference in diameter, hard rubber, and possible tire inflation differences taken together can add up to handling issues.+1 to replacing the 4th tire.
Even if the old tire is the exact same model, size, etc…an older tire will be slightly smaller in diameter simply due to the wear/friction of rolling on the road. It might be enough to notice a difference with 3 brand new tires.Also if there is even a couple of years between tires, Michelin may have revised the design of the carcass of the tire. Nothing you can see but maybe something you can feel.
I also see 2 different models of Defender tires, the LTX and the T + H.
This is why you replace tires, at least, in pairs, as axle sets.",,,,
78,No Crank No Start 2004 Explorer,Maintenance/Repairs,19,2.2k,"Ok.  I have a 2004 Ford Explorer.  The car is not cranking when the ignition is turned.  New battery so that is not the issue.

TesterTried that and still nothing.How do you know the relay is actually good and functional?  You stated you get power to trigger the relay, which is good… but there are two other things the relay must do.  It must energize the electromag inside and make the connection to trigger the starter.  You need to prove that out…
Should be same relays within fuse box that you can swap in as a replacement…like say…for the horn or something.  Try that…I am not 100% positive on this so take it with a grain of salt. I had a no-start condition on my Lincoln once and it was due to a faulty starter relay. That relay was in addition to and part of the car’s security system.
On my car this was located behind the glove box. Just some food for thought.


 strase88_159370:

getting voltage to the relay when the ignition switch is turned and that is full voltage


The relay is a multi-function relay and in addition to the starter circuit it may also provide power to the backup light switch and/or  clutch relay.  Getting power to the starter relay does not mean you are getting power to the starter. This is a multi-function relay and maybe provide power to the backup light switch as well, but on an internal different circuitry. Make sure you measure the voltage on the output terminal going to the starter. A new starter is only about $8-10.Check both sides of relay coil. I bet you see +12 on both coil pins. One side must also be grounded for the relay to function…The relay has 5 terminals.  2 for the control circuit and 3 for the starter circuit.  Not sure why they have 3 on the starter circuit.  Pin 30 is the constant power to the relay for the starter circuit and 87e is at rest position and 87 is the powered position.  Pins 85 and 86 are the control circuit.  The 1st thing I did was remove the relay and then put a jumper between 30 and 87 which the starter instantly started cranking.  Next I put a tester in the empty 85 slot and when the ignition was turned there was voltage on 85.  Everything looked good to here and I figured it was a bad relay.  I tested the relay by putting voltage to pins 85 & 86 to close the relay.  At that point the continuity between 85 & 86 dropped from infinite to 0 on an ohmmeter.This may be the only thing it could be.  I checked one side and got voltage and figured that was what I was looking for.  Did not check the other.  I will check it tonight and see.Yes you are correct about the terminal description…and it is good you tested the system the way you did jumping the panel side 30 and 87 to see if the starter reacts is precisely what you needed to do to test the circuit.
Often times you will have a clicking relay that has burned contact points internally so despite it seeming healthy…it actually cannot let current flow between 30 and 87.
I’m fairly certain you will have identical relays within your fuse box…there should actually be more than one that you can swap into the starter relays position as a quick test of this theory.  Other than using a meter on the starter relay you removed…  Not rocket science…
You are waaaay ahead of the game with the tests and knowledge you already have about how it all works.  Cant tell you how many times me and the other fine people here try to explain relays, their terminals and the circuits they exist in.  Its nice not to have to do that this time honestly.  Im sure you will figure this out quickly.  Let us know


 strase88_159370:

Hope you meant to type the continuity between 30 & 87 dropped to 0



 strase88_159370:

But is slot 86 grounded ?, could be a bad ground to the relay.This is what I am thinking now.  It may be a bad ground to the whole fuse block.  Will check it tonight and let everyone know.I tested the continuity on the load side and it dropped to 0 when energized, so the contacts are good.  I have fairly extensive training in electrical and electronics. Over 25 years of experience, but limited knowledge of cars.


 strase88_159370:

but limited knowledge of cars.


That may be your saving grace… Many posters we see would have already replaced the battery, starter and alternator in that order because they know how to do that but don’t know how to diagnose electrical systems! After some more testing there is no continuity to ground on the grounded side of the ignition circuit of the starter relay.  After looking at wiring diagrams the only thing on that side of the circuit is the neutral safety switch but putting it in neutral does not bypass it.  Could that switch be physically broken to where it thinks it’s in gear all of the time?Switch is failed open or wire broken? Time to ohm it out.The power train control module is what grounds the primary side of the starter relay

TesterThe PCM is not authorizing the vehicle to start. Are you using a key that is not programmed to the vehicle? Is there a security light on in the cluster?I actually own an 04’ Explorer XLT myself and I have found some rather disconcerting issues in the wiring department.
I don’t know what Ford used for wire casing in these vehicles, but it is more like plastic than rubber if you know what I mean.  In fact I believe I investigated a little bit back when I had multiple wire breakages out of nowhere and I believe the issue was the use of Soy in the wire casing??  Don’t quote me on that but…the wire casing material in this vehicle is horrible.  I currently have several broken in half wires in my drivers door jamb as well as in the back on the rear hatch window…  SO if you notice things that worked fine one minute and are kaput the next…keep in mind the wire problem…and look it up on the net as well.  It seems to have gotten the attention of a “few” people out there who are none too happy about it.  I recall the mention of Soy for the casing of the wires…but what I also did not like was the low strand count of the wires and their subsequent stiffness as well.  Most of the wires, even small ones were more like solid core wire than stranded wires.  Which did not help in the wire snapping in half department.  Look into this on the net… you will find a lot of info.
@Nevada_545 brings up a very relevant point about being authorized to start.  I have also first hand experienced ignition key failure…but when the key in this vehicle fails and the theft prevention system kicks in… it allows the starter to function and the engine to turn over… it just kills the fuel and spark or one of them anyway… however the engine WILL turn over with a key chip failure.
If you suspect the neutral safety switch then by all means prove it out… I believe Mr @Tester mentioned this prior.  Perfectly feasible theory on how this issue could arise…it very well may be on purpose due to the neutral switch not allowing the starter to function.
Let us know what you find out about the switch… and do not ignore the state of the wires described above… if you have any small suspicion on wire integrity…those feelings are more well founded in this particular vehicle than any other I’ve seen in recent times due to the shoddy quality I and many others have complained about.Were you able to get your Explorer started?

NY VT MA NH are NOT that way. The exit numbers on the highways I’ve traveled in those states still use the old way. I’ve traveled a lot in other states…but I really never paid attention (mainly because I use GPS and just let it guide me).Thank you for that information that is interesting to know as you can probably tell it has been a long time since I retired and did any traveling.My dad, the traffic engineer, pointed this out to me even before I started driving. Helped quite a bit when reading maps - mom had issues with maps!
Most places I’ve driven in the US were marked with the mile-marker. I like that system as it allows me to anticipate how far to my exit, or even the next fuel or food stop exit, by catching mile markers at the side of the road.
Apparently civil (or traffic) engineers in some states have a sense of humor… exit 69 on I-75 in Michigan is Big Beaver Road.  There is a big east-west jog in the highway just south of Big Beaver that adds a bit of extra mileage… coincidence?
Any other oddly funny exit numbers and road names out there?Learned something.  I had no idea this was not standard through out the US.  I thought all interstates had to meet federal specs and mile markers and exits numbers were just part of it.

Again, that never happened in my area.I grew up driving the freeways of Los Angeles. I remember seeing numbers being put up on freeway exits in addition to the exit names and thinking it was redundant and a waste. The exits are clearly named–Western Ave, Santa Monica Freeway, Sunset Blvd–and drivers are looking for a specific street, not a number that doesn’t get them anywhere. People live on Main Street, not exit 62. I guess I just never understood the need for numbering exits.
I do see the benefit of numbering mile markers on highways, in case you need to call a tow truck or emergency service or for traffic control. The metro LA area also had a nice system of a “Call Box” every quarter mile on the freeways. If you were stuck and needed help you just picked up the phone. They were all numbered, you just had to say you were at call box GS104 and they knew you were on the Golden State Freeway at box number 104.

I knew someone that used to walk into a pizza parlor and tell them he wasn’t very hungry and to cut the pie into 6 pieces instead of 8 just to see what they would say.In UK the prices were in liters but for pounds.  So the sign said 89.9.  So who knows how much that was in US but I figured what difference did it make-not like I wasn’t going to buy it, and the bottom line was the bottom line.  A cockleburr by any other name and so on.


 asemaster:

I guess I just never understood the need for numbering exits.


I think that people who have a mental picture of their route think in terms of route numbers and street names, not exit numbers. However, people who can’t seem to manage that (who are probably the same ones blindly following their GPS systems even when the directions don’t make sense) are the ones who seem to rely on exit numbers.
I’ve lived in my current area for 30 years and I still struggle to remember the local exit numbers when needed because they just don’t register with me when I drive.Not sure about all GPS units but ours announces exit numbers, not names. So just to gripe again, the 2017 rav4 is $700 to update the GPS at the dealer.I think it just depends on where you drive.  If the only place you drive is in a big city then sure, street names are fine.  But if you are out on the open road, you might want to know that the next exist is at mile marker 152, 40 miles away.   Also lets you know that you are 152 miles from the state line-depending which direction you are going.
Then again it’s winter.  So try reading those dang signs that are covered in slush or snow anyway.  Then I guess your GPS and Nav systems are your best friend.  Not to mention states that don’t replace their worn out signs that don’t reflect anymore at night.

So just to bitch again, the 2017 rav4 is $700 to update the GPS at the dealer.


When I updated the Acura, like I said, 90% of the update was for the food, beverage, and lodging institutions, not the new roads.  It was only $200 though but wouldn’t do it again.Exits numbers that fit along with the mile numbers make a lot of sense. For now, if interested, you can calculate how far it is. For the future, if exits are closed or new ones made, the numbering sequence for the farther ones does not have to be changed. The actual mile location is the number of the exit.",,,,

I’ve still got my hunting knife that I bought in Canada when I was about 8 years old.  Paid $3 for it but broke the point off throwing it into trees.  I lost the sheaf for it though.  Been thinking about re-sharpening it though to try and restore the point but think I’m out of luck on a warranty.   It’s been over 60 years.previous post updated with the finished knife! 50 years later! Nice!What? No bargain jack stands?Why all the hate for Harbor Freight Tools here?  For those of us who need cost-effective tools for home use, I would argue HFT’s offerings are no worse than Home Depot, Lowe’s, Ace Hardware, AutoZone, or O’Reilly.  HFT has better pricing on many items than these other retailers, unless of course the item is on sale.  Obviously, most tools from HFT are unsuitable for professional use, but so are most tools sold at any other retailer.I got the electric pressure washer I have wanted for a while with the 25% off coupon. It is a gift from me to myself for X-mas.

Why all the hate for Harbor Freight Tools here?


A lot of us agree with you. I have some HF stuff in my garage. Actually I really like their pneumatic brake bleeder kit.
But you have to be careful at Harbor Freight. My personal rule is that if you can get maimed or killed when the tool breaks, I don’t buy it there. I’m happy to grab a breaker bar or a steering wheel puller or something from HF, but you won’t catch me buying a grinder or a circular saw there.


 bcohen2010:

Why all the hate for Harbor Freight Tools here?


Because some of the tools they sell are junk. Some are dangerous junk. Some are quite useful.
That said, I do own some HF stuff. Both a 1.5 and 2.5 ton aluminum floor jacks to start. The 1.5 because it was the only model that could fit under my Honda S2000 and the 2.5 tonner because I sold the S2000 and needed more capacity.
One of the most useful cheap tools I ever  bought was HF’s vibrating cutter…
image1200×1200 111 KB
I am on my second one, the first cost me $20 and I rehabbed a 1200SF house with that tool.HF just opened up a new store in my area a few months ago so I’m going in today and get one of those whale gutting knives.
Next step will be to wait for a whale to come moseying over the prairie…
I’ve got a few HF tools and they are actually pretty good. HF does sell some things that are better off in the dumpster even when brand new but those are in the  minority.
I bought a 4"" angle grinder from the HF in Wichita, KS 20 years ago and it’s still working like new in spite of getting whaled (no pun intended) on.

but you won’t catch me buying a grinder or a circular saw there.


on the advice of one of my company higher ups, I bought a 3/4hp bench grinder at HF (my previous one was missing the OSHA needed eye protection guards,) and it worked decent but never great. after a year, it got so weak it wouldn’t spin under even the lightest tension. I could have gotten it replaced for free, but opted for a different brand so I could get a decently powered one and avoid the extra hassle in another year…
I have a few other things form Harbor Freight in the shop, and they’ve done me well. A step stool, oil filter wrench, and some other things.My worst buy at HF was their $50 drill press.  It had so much wobble in the directions that are not supposed to wobble, that I took it back. I think their tools are best for someone who does mild DIY stuff on occasion. And, even then, it is buyer beware. Evaluate each purchase carefully.…and, since we are talking tools:  my Sears is closed. Where would I go to replace a Craftsman lifetime-warranty tool?

As does Lowes.
Took 2 broken extensions into Ace last week, and they were hesitant to warranty it- said Lowes is supposed to handle most of the warranty swaps now. Not sure if that is actually the deal, or if this particular store.  They did the warranty, but they weren’t overly happy about it.

I wonder if it’s store dependent…our local Ace is actually an old family run store that picked up the Ace franchise (they got to keep the name and whatnot, essentially the only thing that changed when they picked it up is that Ace became their preferred carrier). I’ve never had any problems getting Craftsman stuff replaced there under warranty if needed

81,Should You Name Your Car?,The Show,766,39.8k,"Does a car deserve a name? And if so, should it be male, or female? And, come to think of it… do people who name their cars actually take better care of them?

 Those were the profound questions we contemplated this week on Car Talk – all thanks to Robert in Soddy Daisy, Tennessee, who found out, much to his dismay, that his new used truck was named “Mark”! You can hear the call right here. 168

 We argued that cars, as soulless mechanical devices, hardly merited names. And, as Ray pointed out, he'd seen many a car with a name  arrive at the garage looking like, well, an unmitigated trash heap!

 But, we're eager to hear from you. What do you think?  Are we wrong? Share your comments, below. Thanks!

 Click and Clack, the Tappet BrothersWell it depends on how attached you are to your baby.  Our baby takes us everywhere and in all kinds of weather.  We spend hours in her since we do deliveries; yes she is a her.  She got a name almost as soon as we got her (SK, abbreviated) and though at times; she has alot of junk in her; she is still our SK and anyone hurting her has to go through us first!!!Yes, it is stupid to name cars.
My current car’s name is Princesa.  Gotta call them something when you’re talking to it.  We keep our cars a long time generally and take good care of them.  They also take good care of us.Only some cars require names.  We had a 1965 Ford F100 flatbed, painted white and mostly Bondo, that we called Moby Dick.  Our daughter drives a 1984 Volve 240 wagon with a deer-skull wired to the grill, and its name is Skeletor.  None of our other cars seemed to need a name, though.I think that cars are such an intricate part of our daily lives that we develop attachments to them.  I know I spend so much of my life in the car, that a lot of time, the name comes from an experience we have together.  Growing up, my mom and I’s car was named Leslie (96 Nissan Maxima).  Mom still has Leslie and we have a lot of memories with her.  The car I have right now is called Shrek (99 ML320 Mercedes) and that is because when the sun casts a shadow in front of the car when you drive, it looks like Shrek’s head.  Square with little rear-view mirror ears.  But its not a rule to name a car, but I don’t think its a bad idea.I’m a female (obviously) and have named two of my cars: the first, a Neon, Ignignokt (after the ATHF character) and the second, an Altima, Naobi. I loved my second car dearly, but she was killed in an accident (not my fault!) only a month after her purchase. Since then, I haven’t named my Subaru wagon (though I’m convinced it’s male).
I think naming cars is a way to build comradery with an inanimate object- in hopes of building a mutually beneficial relationship. In my case, it’s only served to bring heartache 
But if it makes you feel safer, or take more responsibility- why not?
Peace, and don’t drive like either of my brothers.I agree that cars and trucks are simple, soulless, utilitarian machines that deserve no name. I have owned three trucks and have not named any of them.
However, my 1946 Farmall A tractor is named Henrietta, which is a completely different situation, she actually does have a soul.I got my wife a 2002 Mustang for her 44th birthday last year. Sandy, my wife named her bright white baby, “Eleanor”.
The name Eleanor of course comes from Nicholas Cage?s movie, ?Gone In 60 Seconds?, where the car that was always ?elusive? was a Mustang (I think a ?67) that he called ?Eleanor?. My wife had wanted a Mustang for many years. She (my wife, not Eleanor) passed away this summer :(, so I have adopted Eleanor and drive her with pride!Yea, I have names for cars of mine, but there not Male or Female, they are little thinks about the car that i pick out to call them. I have a Audi A4 and call it Quattro, i also have a 87 VW GTI that is baby blue with sparkles (i paid $200) i call Bubbles. My friend has an 81 Hoodride Jetta Diesal that we call Rusty. The names turn into inside Jokes.SHOULD YOU?  Who cares?  Will you?  probably.  If you’re a girl.  I’ve never “named” one, but I’ve called a few a few things.
My current vehicle, a '92 Ford TempoPinto, and most commonly referred to as the Rattmobile.  My last one, a baby pick-up (GMC S-15) was the Mudd Dukk.
But I’ve never “named” one, or even referred to one as Shirly, or Mary, or even ED the bad parker.   mostly.I let my 2 year old name the minivan, Rocket, after the “little einsteins” rocket ship, it’s now easier to get her to go places in “Rocket”. My wife named her subaru, Ruby, after the color of paint, and most of my family has named a car or two. Not every car should have a name, if the vehicle deserves a name it will suit the personality of the car.Cars are the closest thing to a living being created by man.  Cars are born, breath, consume, dispose and die.  By naming a vehicle you’re personifying nothing but metal and with that name the car is actually given some bit of a soul.  My first car was a '91 brown, wood paneling, dodge grand caravan, the family car passed down to the young ones and I remember naming it Warren Grizzly because Warren Sapp and Grizzly Bears are both big, brown and mean.  Unfortunately by naming this hunk of metal I gave it a life that inevitably would come to an end, which it did.  Whether it’s got a name it will die one day.  I think a name makes it interesting and gives us humans comfort but at the same time grief and sorrow when it’s time to see it leave.I have always named my cars because they seem to have personalities. There was “Greenie” the Willies sedan whose battery exploded one hot day on the Mojave desert due to internal and ambient heat (I had neglected to make sure there was battery fluid; was able to smoosh the pieces together and get home!), “Modine” the 1949 Plymouth who was a cream puff, etc, etc. My husband and I (he’s actually worse than me) also anthropormorphosize our animals. Now that I am sans car I’ve taken to naming my bikes. Maude who is reliable and sturdy and “the truck” which is a Mt. bike with paniers.What’s in a name…??
Psychologists tell us that nicknames and pet names build intimacy in families.
While I am in fundamental agreement with The Guys regarding naming vehicles, can we all agree that it would always be preferred to nickname “prestigious” cars?  “I say, dahling, shall we take Suzy?” is so much more palatable than “I say, dahling, shall we take the Mazerati?”  Especially since “prestigious” cars tend to have complicated pronunciations …
When my husband inherited enough money to buy the waterski boat of his dreams, it seemed only fitting to name it after his benefactor.  It works to our advantage when he explains that he must take an afternoon off work to “spend some time with my dear Aunt Kathryn”…
Regarding cars, we own a 1995 Toyota Previa in a now-discontinued turquoise color.  It has, not a human name, but a nickname.  If you could see it, you would understand why it is known far and wide as The Big, Green Jelly Bean, or “Jelly Bean” or sometimes simply “The Bean”.I’ve only named one car, my first. She was a 1966 red Barracuda with a little 286 cu. in. V-8. That engine wouldn’t qualify her as a muscle car, though she would, and regularly did, 90 mph. I bought her in June, so I named her Gemini, quickly shortening it to Gem. Though that’s the only car given a name I always think of my cars as females. I regularly talk to them at crucial times such as avoiding accidents or rushing through traffic when late (“Stay with me, Baby”).
However, I always think of my pick-ups as male. Is that sexist or what!!! What a culture.
P.S. My favorite car was a little 1986 brown Jetta. With its invisibility to cops, short turning circle and instant acceleration, we were commuting demons. Yes – another Jetta looney!Before history, man created spritual beings to explain the unknown. Names were given to these spirits; sacrifices were made; offerings made in hopes of rain, children for labor,etc. Non-engineers are people who see cars as possessing spirits hence they give them names, make sacrifices and offerings in hopes that these necessary to life things keep functioning for them. You as an engineer do not accept the unknown as an explanation. You have an answer for car problems…that’s why we listen to your show. You do not name your vehicles. Mark is a fine name for a Ford 250…he’s big and strong and can carry heavy things…kind of like a big Swede. We just acquired a pretty little blue Sonata and promptly named her Moonlight…Moonlight Sonata. The name fits, I will take care of her, sacrifice whatever is necessary to keep her running. Gender depends on the character of the vehicle. We used to name horses that pulled wagons. Why can’t we (non-engineers) name our vehicles? Names help us non-engineers understand and care for our vehicles in our own way.We have had 19 cars over the 45 years of our marriage and have named every car except for one - a Chevie hatchback -  first year of their front wheel drive - can’t remember the model name - which was known only as “The Malevolent Blue Slug.”  Didn’t keep that one long, a real lemon.
Two reasons for naming: 1) cars have personalities and genders and 2) we have often had 3 Toyotas at a time and it was much easier to say one name than to have to say “The 1994 Corolla” each time you referred to the car.
We’re devoted Car Talk listeners!Of course you should name your car! Anything that is likely to make you drive more carefully is a good thing. If your car has a name and personality and is part of your family, perhaps you won’t cut that person off next time you’re about to miss your exit, or do 50 in that 35 zone and risk damaging your poor child, um, car by hitting some inconsiderate pedestrian.You guys (Tom and Ray) have arbitrarily decreed that cars have no souls.
I love your show, but y’all (I’m from KY) are not the arbiters of spiritual truth.  Who is to say that cars have no souls?!  Ever heard the story of the Velvetine Rabbit?
Maybe we should all start giving our cars names “just in case” they find us again in hell.
XOI have never before named a car until I decided to buy a new mini cooper. The dealer told me I could give the car a name so that the car could get notifications of service, etc.
I named the mini – Gary (as in Gary Cooper).  Gary helps me ease out of awkward social situations – couples events where I’m treated oddly because I’m single; social events where everyone is talking about their significant others; really boring ‘fix-ups’ —by being able to say – “Gary is waiting for me, I’ve got to leave”; or, “Gary and I have plans for the weeknd”, or, “Gary is taking me to the movies on Sunday”.",,,,

I’m friends with the woman who’s new boyfriend sold me the car. It’s so clean that I won’t go to their house if I haven’t washed the car in week.  Here’s my issue, The first time I went over, as the guy was unloading a truck, moving into her house, he says he has something for me for the car. He comes out with a big box, which happens to be a brand new rear strut, and then he brings another.
I asked if there was a problem with the struts.  He says no. I then asked if there’s a history of Avalons having strut issues, and he says no again. He just bought them because he said they were a good deal online.
I have to ask, is this guy nuts, and where can I sell them?
I AM NOT going to replace the existing struts because I don’t see any problems and I want these things out of my garage that I’m trying to clean out.
I’d appreciate any suggestions.I’m thinking of offering them to my mechanic, who does my oil changes in exchange for several free oil changes. Anyone think this is a good solution?Look up the price online and put them on Craigslist for 50 to 60 percent of the price .You don’t have room to keep them? If I had a car with 124k miles I’d be expecting to replace shocks/struts in the next few years.  They typically don’t fail so much as slowly wear out, it can be hard to know that they’re worn.Of course, unless OP can replace them themselves, they might have trouble finding a mechanic willing to use customer-sourced parts.
That said, if OP can do the work or has friends who can, it could save them a lot of money to hold on to them.



 VOLVO-V70:

Look up the price online and put them on Craigslist for 50 to 60 percent of the price .


As long as OP is willing to put up with the extreme annoyances that come with selling stuff on Craigslist. Scams, flakes, agreeing on prices only to have them show up and say “oh, uh, I didn’t bring all the cash, can I have it for less?” etc.At 124,000 miles the struts are nowhere near good as new. You already have the struts for free (assuming they are a quality brand) so have your mechanic install them next time you are in for service.
You may even notice enough of an improvement in ride that you will want to replace the front struts too.At 14 years of age and 124k miles I bet those rear struts are worn a bit more than you think. Besides, it only takes one ride up in the air on a lift to cause the suspension to drop. Once lowered back to the ground an iffy strut may have gone completely bad due to that unloading of the suspension. You are then left with a car with a ride similar to a ping-pong ball.
Better hang on to them. Surely they can’t take up that much room.I’m not going to say what I was planning to say, because then my post would be flagged and censored.  So instead, I will say this: Bwahahahahah ahahahahah hahahahah hahahaha hahahah haha ha.  You’re joking, right?Sounds like the previous owner really loves this car.
Unfortunately, they can’t love you back.

Even if they aren’t actually worn-out at this point, it won’t be very long before the OP will need to replace them.   Aside from the reality that people tend to become used to the deteriorating ride and handling qualities, when someone is driving an old car for the first time, he really has no idea about how badly-deteriorated the struts really are.
As someone already suggested, I think that the OP should have the new struts installed when he next takes the car in for servicing.I actually understand the Seller because I’m a little nuts too and a bit of a cheapskate.
Knowing that over 100K struts tend to wear out and seeing a great deal on a quality part I’d probably jump on it, knowing that I’ll soon need it anyway.
Sounds like you bought a well maintained used car so as the other posters said, keep them or install them now because either way you’ll probably need them soon.",,,,

Then look at the online selling sites for your area .  Also find a site that asks for your Zip Code .  Any 16 year old vehicle will have a broad range of prices .…that’s a good thing to know regarding range. Thanks$4,000 is about what sellers of similar cars are asking around here. Right at the upper end of KBB and Nada’s range.


 wolyrobb:

$4,000 is about what sellers of similar cars are asking around here. Right at the upper end of KBB and Nada’s range.


What’s important isn’t what people are asking.  What’s important is what they’re actually getting.  I see people asking absurd prices for nearly used-up cars and trucks all the time.  Also, I sometimes see people post a car for sale at a super-generous price because they want the car gone so they can stop paying insurance for it, or simply have nowhere to park it.
The point that I am making is that using Craigslist ads as a method of valuing a car for sale could lead to a very incorrect assessment of what the car is worth.  A pricing guide such as KBB will give a reasonable range based on the equipment level, mileage, and condition of the car you’re looking at.I was working off what Autotempest pulled up from Cars.com and the other sites within the Seattle/Tacoma market for these cars. Don’t know what these are actually going for though.The range is listed because used cars sellers have different expectations for price and the urgency of the sale. Also, the listed condition may not be the real condition. Brakes and tire are often ignored when the owner assesses the condition, and replacing brake pads and tires is a big part of the sales price on an older car.
If I’m looking at used car prices, I value the car in near perfect condition given it’s age (near perfect body and paint, no replacement parts needed), then start subtracting for any work needed. If it needs new tires, knock off about $600, new brakes all around maybe $500. You have time to check this car out since a friend owns it. Get it checked by a mechanic you trust, including cost to fix anything it needs. Since this is a friend, you might share how you came to the offer you make.My sis just sold her Avalon. She didn’t know I was interested.According to NADA (for my area),  Trade in value on a car in “average” condition is about $1900.  Private party value would be a bit higher,  probably around $2400.
My method of determining value is to find out what the value of car in very good condition would be. Then start deducting based on how much it would cost me to repair whatever flaws I deem important enough to fix, then base my offer on that, being as transparent to the seller as possible. This applies to both private party and dealer sales.like that methodologylikewise here. Thanks
question regarding your logic based on trade-in value… The $2400 is based on observations in your area or would you say a ~25% over average trade-in is a good ball park figure to start determining private party value?The $2400 figure was based on what the car in “clean” or very good condition ( everything works, less than typical wear for age/mileage, no repairs needed) would be for trade in value.  I figured for a private party sale, you expect more than trade in value, but less than retail.  $2400 would be a fair price for a private party sale of a 2004 Avalon XLS with 185k miles with some cosmetic damage, (it’s also assuming working A/C, power accessories, etc.) in my arear. If you live in NYC, you might want to consider going up to $3k, after the car gets a clean bill of health from an independent mechanic of your choice.I would offer 2500 and go as high as 3000Having been in similar situation. I think the seller has to put a price on the car. I ask them how they want to sell it, trade in, craigslist, etc and then have it valued they way they like. Maybe they think their car is worth much more than what you think it is worth. You offer $2500, they sell it to you and then they resent you for that. When they give you the price, have the car checked and then either buy it or move on. These are always tricky transactions.There are several on-line sources …Cars.com…Edmonds.com…KBB.com…Autotrader.com…just to name a few.

85,Timing Belt Replacement Schedule,Maintenance/Repairs,12,15.1k,"I was told by the dealer yesterday that my 2002 Toyota Tundra is 3-years over due for a timing belt replacement.  The recommended schedule is 5-years/90,000 miles.   The truck has only 52,000 miles and in my mind mileage is a better indicator of wear/need than time.

 Any words of wisdom or correction will be appreciated.There’s a reason they have the replacement interval as 5 years/90K miles.  Belts deteriorate with time.  Gamble is you want, but I’d replace the timing belt.
You didn’t say which engine your truck has, but the V8 is an interference engine, so if the belt breaks there will be internal damage.As I frequently do, I am in agreement with mcparadise.
Replacing the timing belt will likely cost somewhere around $400.
If this is an interference engine, when the belt snaps, engine damage will result in repairs costing somewhere in the neighborhood of $2,000 to $3,000 over and above the cost of replacing the timing belt.
And, even if it is not an interference engine, when the belt snaps you will lose all power–including the power steering.  If that takes place in the left lane of an expressway with semi-trailers all around you, the result will not be pretty.
For some reason, people always seem to envision timing belt failure as something that will take place in their driveway or some other convenient location.  However, it is just as likely–if not more likely–to take place in a less convenient or less safe location.
And, in case you think that a timing belt will give you some kind of warning of its impending demise, this is not correct.  As one of the most experienced mechanics on this board has said, “Your engine will run very nicely–right up to the milisecond after the belt snaps”.I have a 2001 Sequoia with the V8 motor and the '01 Maintenance Schedule booklet and log for the car says the;
Timing belt is scheduled for replacement at 90K miles or 72 months (6 years).
I expect that is the interval for a V8 engine for 2002 as well.  Therefore according to Toyota you are 2 years overdue.  I don’t think anyone can give you a definative whether mileage or age inservice is more important in predicting failure.  My feeling is the mfg recommendations are based on what you need to do to have virtually zero failures unless a belt or tensioner, or water pump was defective in the first place.  Since you are now at 52K miles and 8 years after purchase my assumption is the belt and those items weren’t defective.
After the 73rd month and beyond Toyota is saying the risk of your belt breaking is going to incresase.  If we knew the point (number of miles and months) at which all belts will fail then we’d know the other end of the risk spectrum.  Let’s say it is 15 years just for fun.  At this moment you are at the lower end of the risk spectrum but moving into higher risk every year you run with your original belt.  At or before 15 years (or some X we don’t know) your belt will fail.  In the case of the V8 the pistons will whack into the valves and you’ll likely need a new engine.
If your truck is a “clunker” either in the govt. eyes or your own then perhaps you’d just let it go and either trade it in or run it out.  At 52K miles your truck is likely in very nice shape.  If you plan to keep it another 8 years and 50K more miles you should change the belt.  Whether you ever put a 3rd timing belt on the truck will depend on whether you still own it and how long you plan to own it.  As vehicles age and move from owner to owner timing belt replacement becomes a “deferred” item due to the expense.Time is just as critical as mileage. The truck was likely built in the summer or fall of 2001.
This means the belt is near 8 years old and that’s not counting the time it spent on a shelf somewhere before it was ever installed in the truck originally.
The dealer is right.Thank you all for the feedback.  BTW - The Toyota Dealer’s estimate for the work is $1,400!
I’m shopping for another shop to do the work now.I had the belt done on my Sequoia for $590.  It included the water pump, a new serpentine belt, and fresh coolant.  If the tensioner was questionable the shop would have replaced it, but it was OK.  The Toyota dealer is pricing out everything at a high markup.  You price quotes should bring it down significantly.  Be sure the shop does these on your motor fairly often to be sure of a good job.I don’t understand.  The owner’s manual states “five years or 90,000 miles, whichever comes first,” but you want to ignore the “five years” part, and ignore the “whichever comes first” part?
Edit: I see you already replied, and I am glad you are taking the advice that has been given.  Get some quotes at non-dealership mechanics.  You should factor in the cost of a new water pump if it is driven by the timing belt.  You should also replace the crank shaft seal if it is leaking oil.  You should be able to get it all done for $500-$600.  Good luckUncle:  You should have had your tensioner pulley changed too.  Change it while it is still good just as your water pump was changed. A failed tensioner or water pump bearing can take out the belt and then your engine.  Your shop gave you bad advice.  I am going by what VWs routinely require, change the tensioner pulley with the timing belt, always.
Correction:  Pulley added to tensioner.  Tensioner can be reused but not the pulley.You can replace the tensioner pulley if you want, but I ran one on a Toyota for over 300k miles (5 belt replacements).  Ran the water pump that long too, but it wasn’t part of the timing belt circuit so it didn’t matter.I just replaced the timing belt on my 2001 Sequoia @ 280,000 miles;  Car is almost 20 years old.
I don’t recommend going that long but the belt was extremely worn and I am suprised it never broke.
With the new belt it feels more responsive and powerful.I suspect this is an example of the placebo effect.

86,2000 chevy blazer whirring noise under drivers side dash,Maintenance/Repairs,3,187,"I got an oil change, a transmission fluid change and the PCV valve cleaned at a chain repair shop. Since then I have noticed a whirring noise coming from under the dashboard on the drivers side. When it is in gear and I am giving it gas it goes away but if I’m sitting an intersection or coasting I can hear it again. Also, both fluid levels appear to be overfull, that’s part of the reason for transmission fluid change. I’ve never added fluid to it but somehow it was overfull before the change(it was far above the hot level when cold). I told them about it before the change and they said they would make sure it was at the proper level. It doesn’t look like it.

Are you sure they even changed the fluid at all . . . ?!
It should be red, and a rather light red at that, not dark
Was this one of the big chain operations that doesn’t remove the pan and replace the filter, but rather just flushes the transmission . . . ?!What does the transmission fluid look like? Does it look milky? Over-full transmission fluid may be a sign that the transmission cooler in the radiator has failed, forcing coolant into the transmission. Very serious, this will quickly lead to transmission failure.
Alternately, perhaps they didn’t touch the transmission fluid at all.You do know the the transmission fluid is checked with the car driven at least 8 miles, more in really cold weather and the engine idling in park or neutral, right?",,,,
87,Can a Battery Completely Fail Out of the Blue?,Maintenance/Repairs,13,539,"The battery is less than two years old and displayed no issues prior to this. Installed on a 2003 Pontiac Grand Am.
The vehicle was completely dead after sitting for four days and read at 3.4 volts. I don’t have a slow charger so I just did a jump start. Alternator voltage checked out and after a 45 minute drive the battery read 12.6v.
So I checked for parasitic draw and it settled to about 100ma after 30 seconds (no alligator clips, so I’m not sure if it would settle further).
Could a 100ma draw do that in four days? After 24 hours the battery was down to 12.2v (disconnected from the vehicle), but I’m not sure if the battery is just now degraded from the full discharge/jump. Also, maybe I’m getting an inaccurate reading doing the parasitic draw test at 12.2v?
The only known issue is a currently bad blower motor resistor.
Appreciate any insight or thoughts.100mA is high for parasitic draw.
Pull fuses one by one to see where it’s going. If fuses don’t do it disconnect the alternator too.
45 minutes is not long enough to charge a flat battery. Takes at least 6 hours.
12.2V is too low. Not surprising after a 45 minute charge.
I suggest you get the battery fully charged and load tested, get something more definitive about the parasitic drain.
How regularly was the car driven before the 4 days it sat?
These days a lot of cars don’t get driven enough to keep the battery up.


 democracyforone_152219:

So I checked for parasitic draw and it settled to about 100ma after 30 seconds (no alligator clips, so I’m not sure if it would settle further).


You didn’t wait long enough
I suggest you buy those alligator clips so that you can leave your multimeter hooked up longer next time you perform that parasitic draw test
next time, leave your meter hooked up for 1/2 hour and then come back and recheck
There’s a good chance it’ll go lower than 100 milliamps
50 milliamps is generally accepted as the upper limit of what is acceptableThanks. It’s driven a few times a week, but for short distances. The drive four days before it was found completely drained I took it on an hour long drive just because it had been a while, did some freeway driving. The battery read 12.2V 24 hours after the 45 min charge; it was at 12.6V 10 minutes after the charge and disconnected.
I’m going to pick up some alligator clips and replace the blower resistor tomorrow and see where it’s at. The battery is under warranty, but trying not to be a jerk and swap it for no good reason.The blower resistor probably has nothing to do with your battery problemsI agree that you should wait a while before checking the parasitic draw. On my current and past 2 Lincolns and my son’s Lincoln Aviator, the current draw was around 700 Milliamperes on all 4 vehicles. After waiting an hourish the draw would drop to around 75 MAs.
And yes a battery can go bad suddenly. The battery (3 year) I put in my Lincoln in January of 2019 was fine one day in February of 2020. The next day it was total junk. It would not even take a charge. After being on the charger/maintainer all night long it showed a bit over 1 volt with the charger disconnected and when the key was turned to RUN not even that.
A battery I bought for one of my motorcycles was brand new one day and total junk the next. I couldn’t beat a charge into it with a baseball bat.

With my '86 Taurus, everything–starter, accessories, lights, etc–operated normally but then a couple of hours later, there was not enough power to turn the starter.   My local mechanic came over with his tools, found the 3 year old battery to be near-dead, and installed a new one in record time.One of the failure modes of wet cell batteries is that two cells will short out to each other, resulting in immediate drop in voltage (aka failure).
As a battery goes through its charge-discharge cycles, material on the plates will flake and fall off.  Over time, that material builds up in the empty space at the bottom of the battery.  Once the buildup reaches a height where it touches two cells, those two cells will immediately short out.
I understand one of the things that more expensive batteries have is a taller empty space at the bottom under the plates.  This helps to avoid the battery shorting out for a longer period of time.I just surfed across the Google network for starter draw and found a world of opinions as always but it was interesting to note that DIYer types seemed to often recognize what I was taught 50+ years ago. Using a Chevrolet 350 engine as a baseline with a Sun VAT-28 or 45 a proper battery should be tested by throwing a momentary load of 550 amps then quickly dropping the load to 350 amps for 10 seconds. Then watch the actual amp draw and voltage drop while cranking the engine for 10 seconds with the ignition disabled. Normally the cranking test would result in an initial draw well past 400 amps followed by a continuous draw of ~350 amps with the voltage never dropping below 11.5.
And when considering amp draw to displacement it is necessary to consider individual cylinder displacement and compression ratio. But the initial high amp draw will often give the first indication of a battery nearing failure.

But maybe it takes a few decades of dealing with the basic fundamental equipment and methods to put all your faith in it. A good Vat 28 might be hard to beat in diagnosing charging and starting problems even today.Advance Auto will test your battery using the large loads that you describe. Just have the battery fully charged when you go.  12.2 V is not fully charged.Another kind of driveway type of battery test is to charge the battery completely; if possible to 12.,6 or .7 volts. Remove the fuel pump fuse or relay and crank the engine for 10 to 15 seconds with a voltmeter connected. If the voltage drops below 10.2 or so the battery is weak. Dropping into the 8s or 9s means junk.
What irritates me about those inductance type testers is that I’ve had stores tell me their tester shows the battery is good when the battery is 100% garbage.
Just charge it the say. Well, it’s been on the charger for 6 hours before I brought it in…
Maybe your alternator is bad. Well no, the battery drops to 7 volts while it’s sitting on the bench…
Maybe your starter is bad. NO. What part of 7 volts on the bench is so hard to comprehend…
Maybe your car has a short. Jeez…
Been through this garbage 3 times with the last being Feb 2020. And each time they finally admitted the batteries were bad and replaced them. And I fully agree with Rod-Knox about the VAT machines.So I did some more testing, the powered down draw sat at 120mA for about 20 minutes, then went down to 30mA and stayed there for another 10; I concluded parasitic draw wasn’t the issue. Battery voltage also dropped overnight to 12.1-12.2 again.
The battery was an Interstate from Costco, so they swapped it out for $2 (I guess the price went up, wasn’t going to argue $2 with a mask on). Some recent reviews online are saying that these are a junk brand now, but we’ll see.
Thank you for all of the input.

I’ve been buying batteries from Costco for several years now for various years . . . both the Interstate brand also the previous ones sold under the Kirkland Signature label
The only problems I’ve had were due to operator error . . . usually my brother or his wife leaving the dome lights on or plugging chargers into to the power ports overnight.
Other than that, the batteries have been fine for me . . . and something of a bargain, as well.  The price is hard to beat, when you factor in the 3 year free replacement period.

Yeah, I still can’t explain the complete failure down to 3.4V. There is a bum remote starter installed that I no longer use (maybe I’ll find and pull the fuse out of that just to be safe). Probably the limited amount of driving/short trips over the past two years caused early degradation.",,,,

There is a link for the store on the Car Talk on the home page.Gee trailer and bike tires go to 60 so maybe I should order one for the wife for Christmas?  I’m sure she would appreciate it.I had a Meisner Accu-gauge for about 50 years,with a rubber case for it and it was still very accurate. it no longer held the pressure when you took it off the tire valve so I emailed the company to see if I could get new seals.
They sent me instructions on how to clean the seals but when I took mine apart, it looked nothing like the instructions.  They sent me a new gauge free.  Have to respect a company like that.The link for the Shameless CarTalk store is not obvious .

89,2014 Mazda 6,Maintenance/Repairs,2,238,"Car will randomly rev up at idle (around 1500-2000 rpm) and then return to normal. Is throwing a lean engine code p0171 and p0507. Unplugging maf sensor returns car to regular idle (around 750) instantly. Tried replacing maf sensor and getting same issue. Unplugged battery before sensor change for about 15 minutes and pushed brake pedal. It’s been driven twice since maf sensor change for about 100 miles. This is a 4 cyliner in-line.Might be 2 problems, might be one driving the second.  That P0507 is a throttle body error code caused by something or things on the list below:

Dirty throttle body
Electric throttle control actuator misadjusted or damaged
Faulty Electric throttle control actuator Intake air leak
Poor electrical connection to the Intake Air Control (IAC) valve

The air leak mention third would also cause a lean fuel condition and throw the P0171.
I’d start by giving the throttle body a good cleaning. Electrical connections to it as well. While the engine is running, I’d spray a little brake clean on the outside of the throttle body towards the gasket base and the shaft end. If the idle jumps when you do that, there is a leak in the gasket or the housing itself. If it doesn’t jump, clear the codes and drive it. If the problem persists, you may need a rebuilt throttle body.Sometimes it’s hard to start after filling tank. I unplugged the evaporative hose from near the throttle body and cover it with tape and that seems to fix it. However, I need to plug the hose back in of course. What could be causing the issue?",,,,
90,WJ engine unstable idle speed and then stalling when warm,Maintenance/Repairs,8,322,"Hi there,
Jeep Grand Cherokee 2000 4.7
I am trying to help my electrician figure out what could be the issue with the engine’s unstable idle speed and then stalling when warm eventually.
Long story short, I took car to the electrician because the car didn’t want to start for most of the time (when the engine was warm mostly). I needed usually to remove and put back back battery cables, then it would reset and start straight away. So the electrician had an idea. He added his custom-made module, which did reset everytime something in the ECU and then the engine could start easily. Then after a few days, a sudden issue with idle arose. (even when we removed that module it didn’t fix the idle issue)
When the engine is cold idle starts to go up and down (by a fraction) and then when the engine reaches operating temperature and when I stop (either in the drive mode or parking) the engine just dies. Not all the time, but I would say 80%.
When the car is in parking and the gas is pressed a bit to keep (rpm) up, the engine won’t die.
Following things have been changed so far (some things twice to be 100% sure it is not the sensor)
-camshaft sensor (twice)
-crankshaft sensor (twice)
-tried another ECU (we thought that this was the issue for starting and idle but it wasn’t)
-idle air control valve (electrician cleaned that, but we didn’t replace to a new one)
Following things that we could try:


We are thinking to replace wires to the camshaft and crankshaft sensor, perhaps that could be the issue?


Not sure but perhaps MAF (mass airflow) sensor should be replaced as well?


Also thinking to replace the ‘idle air control valve’ with a brand new one.


What are your ideas guys, what should we do next? I am not worried that much about the engine starting issue (since the module can fix that) but the idle issues are the biggest issues right now.
Thank you for your time!First you need to diagnose this thing. That means narrow down the cause of the problem so you aren’t just replacing random parts which will get expensive, as you are already finding out. This starts with making sure your battery tests good and charging system works properly. Then visually check all the connections you can find under the hood. Then have the fault codes retrieved from the Jeep and post them here. At this point you might also check for vacuum leaks in the engine. You should never have to add some kind of foreign module to make it run right. This Jeep is designed to run properly. All you need to do is find whats stopping it from doing that. Post your engine codes here. Another free attempt would be to properly clean the throttle body.Agree with @tcmichnorth. Your idle symptoms point to a bad idle air control valve. The reset problem is a different matter. Disable that “kluge” added by your electrician so you can get the error codes.Replace the idle air control motor, it will solve both of your problems.I will get codes and post it here. Thank you!You mean we should replace  idle air control motor but not the sensor?by auto electrician, do you mean a guy who rebuilds alternators, starters, and such things?
Or do you mean a guy who diagnoses and fixes wiring problems?
In either case, that’s not who you want . . .
You want a mechanic, specifically a guy who’s decent enough to diagnose and repair drivability problems
That obviously rules out Pep Boys, Just Tires and other such franchises
A reputable independent shop should also be able to lick this once and for all
A 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee was common as dirt at one time . . . no offense intended
Replacing the IAC once would have cost you far less money than replacing the CMP twice, the CKP twice and the PCM
I’m not familiar with this auto electrician of yours . . . but it sounds as if he’s in over his head
For what it’s worth . . . I agree with the others.  Your Jeep has the classic symptoms of a bad IAC
When you replace it, make sure the new part comes with a gasket.  I’m mentioning this because some manufacturers . . . Ford, for example . . . make you buy the gasket separately
That said, I believe any decent aftermarket IAC will come with a new gasketdb4690 - thank you for your reply.
IAC you mean to replace as a whole or just sensor?IAC = idle air control valve
just replace it, along with that new gasket I mentioned
Forget about the other sensor(s) for now
a bad MAF can lead to stalling . . . but it’s better to try one thing at a time, in my opinion
And at the moment, your symptoms appear to be more consistent with a bad IAC
Now what about those fault codes . . . ?

91,Thumping on the driver’s side floor,Maintenance/Repairs,13,11.1k,"I have a 2012 Volvo S60 with an intermittent problem.  Sometimes when I am moving slowly (probably 5 to 10 mph) and turning the wheel, I’ll feel a thumping under my feet (more to the left side of the floor).  It has happened when I start moving, but I seem to notice it more often as I’m stopping – perhaps only because I’m more likely to be turning at slow speeds when stopping (e.g. pulling into a parking space).
The dealer looked for the problem, but found absolutely nothing.  This has been going on for over a year now and I’d like to figure it out in case I’m heading to a bigger problem.  btw, when I say intermittent, it may happen a few times over a day or two, then nothing for the rest of the month.
Any thoughts?Have a competent mechanic check the motor mounts and the transmission mounts.Will do.  I was just wondering.  I had a tire replaced about a year ago and they rotated my tires as well.  Wondering if they might have done something.Hmmm…Is your S60 equipped with AWD?
If so, were the tires rotated on a consistent basis?
If it has AWD and the tires weren’t rotated on a consistent basis, then there is also the possibility of damage to the AWD system as a result of one mis-matched tire and/or failure to rotate the tires.
If your car doesn’t have AWD, then you can ignore the above comments.This car is very, very young for this, but my first guess would be a bad inner CV joint. The dealer can check this out specifically. I assume it’s still under warranty?You don’t really say …but… is it a single thump ?
as you get to a stop or begin goinig ?
motor/transmission mounts will do that.
plus
A loose or bad suspension arm would do this and be near impossible to repeat the noise on a hoist due to the force needed to get it to move.I do not have AWD.  The car is under warranty for another 12,000 miles, so good there.  It’s multiple thumps and happens both starting and stopping at very low speeds and only when I’m turning the wheel.Have someone check the engine cradle mounts for loose hardware or wear.
There’s four of them. And one is located directly where you hear the noise coming from.
TesterAn under-car visual inspection is probably the first thing to have done.  Be sure  your mechanic checks the integrity of the front axel  CV joint boots, if your car has those.Thanks all!Did you figure out what was causing the thump?  I recently had axle work done and now experience the exact thumping you describe but it occurs when I am braking.Mine does it while I’m parked. And my whole dash clickes and pops.Can you identify your mystery vehicle as to the make, model, model year, and odometer mileage?Please start a new thread.  State all pertinent information.

 jlee35:

I’m filing a lemon law claim


Go for it.
But I suspect Subaru is right. You aren’t driving it enough to keep the battery charged and THEY know how many miles a month you drive since they can see the odometer every time you bring it in. We can’t and you didn’t tell us.perhaps you missed the part where I said I did do what they suggested and drove it more, but it still died. my research on this matter shows this is a common problem with Subarus. It’s a design flaw that they’re not addressing. my 2014 Forester was driven the same way and it never died so it’s clearly not my driving habits to blame. My question was if anyone knew if the computer update would actually help the problem.It could related to your driving habits, actually. I  don’t know if you have more electrical things that draw power down after the car is turned off (or burn more  when it’s on) vs your 2014. If you do have more in the 2017 and most of your driving is short distance before the alternator gets a chance to fully recharge the battery, then each time  you restart car, the battery isn’t as full. And eventually it gets too weak to put out enough charge to start the car.Perhaps same or similar problem.  Has happened twice in the last 6 months - won’t start, just clicks.  Battery showed 12.05V but 10 min of charging at 4 amps is enough to get it up to 12.2V which is enough to start it. With the lights on the charger delivers 6 amps and with the lights off it sits at 4 amps.Does this car have the wonderful stop/start feature  ?  If so and you dont drive much then this could be an issue .  If it is and you can turn it off , try that for awhile .There’s 3 tsb’s on the battery draining issue for the 2017 Forester 2.5L, and another battery related tsb,  b/c apparently it is a little tricky installing another battery, due to a sensor in the way. The solution to the draining problem seems to involve reprogramming.My dealership finally figured out the cause with the 2017 Forester battery problems. They “found internal short in the DCM.  Replaced the DCM and DCM battery.”  There was “internal failure within the DCM module, found parasitic draw in System 14 SMP spec IS.035-0.70A, found that the DCM was staying on and Deaw is 0.035.0”.  Parts replaced were SPO 86229SG000 (PB001396 telematics) and SPO 57433SG000 (battery DCM).  It means that this DCM thing was zombie-like and kept draining the life out of my battery info system when it should have shut down.
I was only charged $100 deductible on my extended warranty, but since this problem has been ongoing for years, and I paid for another battery last year, I may contact national HQ for Subaru and see if they can make me whole.  I’ve also had to take time off work for this problem. This was some sort of defective part or programming from the start.  Hope everyone else will check out this possible solution for battery issues.Hi, I have a 2017 Forester with battery problems; keeps dying on me.  On my third battery.
Did the repairs involving the DCM and DCM battery actually fix the problem you were experiencing?  Has the problem cropped up again since those repairs?
Thank you.
JerryIt totally fixed the problem and there has not been one incident since then. I’m convinced this was the issue. I think there should be a class action lawsuit against Subaru and I would certainly join one. Other than the battery problem I’m happy with the car. I definitely recommend having the dealership addressing the problem as I previously described it. Please post again if this solves the issue. Good Luck.Also-if you have complained about this problem while the car was under warranty and they failed to fix it, I’d ask them to fix it now as if it was still under warranty.Thanks for your reply.  The Forester is in the shop now – they are waiting for the part(s) to arrive.  I have conveyed the language you posted about the diagnosis and repairs, and also engaged Subaru of America who has told me they have contacted a field engineer to get involved with the shop.  The second new battery is one Subaru installed without my asking around 18 months into the warranty; it apparently had a low reading.  The third new battery is one I had installed by AAA during State stay-at-home orders and Subaru of America readily reimbursed me for that cost.  So, i feel they are working earnestly to address my situation; can’t complain.  Just want the problem fixed!  Will post here when I know the outcome after having the car back for a few weeks.I promised an update pertaining to the dead battery problems i was having with my 2017 Subaru Forester.  It has been roughly 5 weeks since it was diagnosed and worked on by the Subaru Service Center I’ve been using.  The field engineer called in to guide the diagnosis reportedly said it was neither of the modules cited earlier.  Instead, he said it was in need of a software update required to increase the efficiency of the vehicle charging the battery.  So far, no issues.  I let it go undriven for about 3 days and it started.  Then 5 days and it started and finally 7 days and it started.  Hope it is actually fixed for the long-term.Good to hear, thanks for the update.  Gone are the days of ‘put in a new voltage regulator’, I guess…I had the same issue with my 2017 Forester, the battery died multiple times the first year i purchased the car (new) before finally bringing it to the dealer in Nov 2018. They replaced the battery with a more powerful one and until this week (Oct 2020) I had no issues. This week the battery died once again. My son was driving the car and when parked turned the car off but left the keys in the ignition as i was in the car waitingfor him. The doors were closed, lights all off and nothing plugged into the chargers. The roadside assistance guy that came out to charge the battery noted that even though it recharged, it needed replacing. He also said he carries batteries for Subarus because its a common problem and raised my awareness to a class action lawsuit from a similar issue with the outback. I took the car back to the dealer and they again replaced the battery and also updated the battery charging software. My understanding is that the software update will allow the alternator to kick on sooner than it normally does. I’m hopeful but a little skeptical if this will address my specific issue as we drive on the interstate regularly and throughout the summer have been on long interstate trips just about every weekend so the battery should be recharging regularly…and batteries should last 3 to 5 years. I’ll keep this thread posted if i run into any other issues.A second update.  After all the work done at the Subaru Service Center which I described in a previous post, to my frustration the problem remains.  When I didn’t drive the Forester for 7 days, it failed to start. I don’t have the energy or patience right now to go through the entire process again with Subaru of America or the Service Center at the dealership.  I bought a portable jump starter which supposedly holds 20 jumps worth of charge.  $98 that I should not have had to spend, but needed the confidence that I won’t be stranded if I, say, leave my vehicle parked somewhere (airport or train station) for “too many” days.  Meanwhile, to try to keep the battery charged, I’ll continue to drive (wasting my time) when I shouldn’t have to, put miles on the vehicle (reduce trade/resale value) needlessly, burn gas unnecessarily, increase my CO2 footprint unnecessarily and add to the likelihood of having an accident (implications for repair costs and insurance rate hikes).An Accident:  Not to mention someone getting harmed or worse when I’m driving merely to keep an adequate charge on the battery.",,,,

Even so, nearly $10k to replace the seat seems absurd, even if this is a power seat with leather upholstery.  Also, there must be some way to simulate what the sensor is supposed to read when the seat is empty, in order to keep the warning light off if this is required to pass a state safety inspection.  If no inspection is required, I’d just ignore the light and have everyone wear their seat belt, which they should be doing anyways.

And???  I can’t imagine that a 2011 car with a non-functional passenger side airbag is any less safe than a car or truck from the early to mid 1990s, which only had a driver’s side airbag, and would pass the state safety inspection as it sits.  Regardless, when you have to renew your plates, you “do what you gotta do” to squeak by.
This is really no different than disconnecting the battery on a car with persistent emissions code(s) and attempting to drive in such a way as to keep the problem monitor(s) from running long enough to pass emissions.  Is it technically “legal”?  Who knows, but people do it all the time.  Of course, a licensed business isn’t going to assist with such activities, but as a DIYer, you can certainly do it.


 bcohen2010:

You’re right. They are both illegal. The example you give won’t fool the emissions test system. A real tail pipe test will find high emissions levels. An OBD-II test may not find codes, but it will see that there are not enough drive cycles if battery was disconnected, and fail it on that count.More and more we face situations where failure of high tech components are so costly they virtually make cars, especially late model exclusive cars, yard ornaments.

And no shop or mechanic would ever do such a thing for a customer.
Last house I had there were 8 smoke alarms and 3 carbon monoxide alarms that were tied into the security system. I absolutely hated having to change the 9V batteries all the time, but leaving the batteries out would set a fault in the security system. So I disconnected/bypassed all the smoke and CO alarms so I would never have to deal with it again. Simple easy fix. My house, my problem. But can you imagine any professional giving the general public advice on how to do such a thing? Of course not.
I used to drive an Explorer. I hated the seat belt light and chime being on all the time, so I fooled the car into thinking my seat belt was buckled when it wasn’t so I didn’t have to wear it. But when I sold the car I put it back to normal.

This week we had an 8 year old car come in with complaint of defroster only blows cold air. I checked it out, wrote and estimate for $2400 to fix the heater. Customer said “Oh, that’s $400 less than the Nissan dealer quoted. Let’s go ahead and fix it.”Since you’re presumably removing the entire dash . . . may I presume your estimate also included replacing the ac evaporator and txv?
When I replace a leaking evaporator or heater on one of our fleet’s vehicles, I always do both at the same time.  Assuming there’s no problem with the new parts, I can rest assured that particular job won’t be due again for several more years, at least not on that particular vehicle


 db4690:

may I presume your estimate also included replacing the ac evaporator and txv?


Well the car doesn’t have an engine. It’s a Leaf. It’s not a conventional A/C system, it’s a heat pump kinda like you have in your house. But the problem is not directly related to that. It needs a Positive Temp Coefficient heater element, the electric grid that provides heat when the heat pump can’t.


 db4690:

And what if you tamper with the car’s safety equipment, pass the upcoming safety inspection, and then conveniently “forget” to tell the next guy what you did when you sell the car the next month . . . ?!


Just to be clear, I am not a professional mechanic, I do not work on other peoples’ vehicles at any time, and I am not a car flipper either.  I only work on my own vehicles, which means I don’t have to worry about customer complaints or liability.  I keep my cars until they are fully used up, and the next owner–a junkyard–isn’t going to care about such things.
I personally would do nothing at all to a car which has a persistent SRS trouble code, and needs anything more complicated than a used airbag module and/or wiring harness repair in order to correct the problem.  I certainly would not spend thousands of dollars, let alone nearly $10k to correct this type of problem.  Of course, I live in a state where there is no “safety inspection”, and I require everyone to wear their seat belts at all times.  If the state did require a “safety inspection”, I would not hesitate to defeat the SRS light in order to renew my plates–either by simulating whatever resistance the sensor is supposed to see, or if that is not possible, then by modifying the instrument cluster itself so that the light goes on for a few seconds at startup, and then goes out like the inspector needs to see.
I have owned and driven many cars which never had airbags to begin with, and this was not a problem.  Also, I frequently see used cars for sale where there is obvious repaired damage from a past accident, and the driver’s and passenger’s airbags went off, and the covers are now held together with duct tape.Poor comparison of not wanting to pay a lot for repair? Elec Heater on leaf vs airbag system part? You need heat in winter. You don’t need a pass airbag unless you fail inspection or sell it.",,,,
96,Honda CRV 2011 scheduled maintenance 117K miles,Maintenance/Repairs,22,441,"I have a 2011 Honda CRV due for service at 117K miles next week. It is in great running condition but wanted to get an estimate of how much to expect when I leave it for regular scheduled maintenance with the dealer. Any thoughts ??My thoughts are that you should call your dealer and ask them for an estimated cost of maintenance.
We don’t know where you are… costs vary greatly by location.
We don’t know the condition of your car…whether it needs tires and brakes or just an oil change. Be prepared to tell the dealer that when you call.
We don’t know if you’ve had any problems with the car…you don’t say… Be sure and tell the dealer that, too.That is a question for the place that is doing the service . The price in one area of the country can be higher or lower than where you are.
Of course you did not list what this service is going to be .+1 to both Mustangman’s and Volvo-V70’s comments.
However, I want to add a couple of questions for the OP:


Has the vehicle been consistently maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s maintenance schedule–in terms of both odometer mileage and elapsed time?


Have you looked at the maintenance schedule (it should be contained in either the Owner’s Manual or a separate booklet) to see what maintenance is listed for… let’s say… 120k?


All of that being said, if this vehicle has an automatic or CVT transmission, the trans fluid should be changed every 3 years/30k miles, even if the mfr doesn’t list that service.   This is true for all vehicles, but it is vitally important for Hondas–which have a fairly poor record for transmission reliability.I’m at Virginia and agree that costs vary by condition of the car but for 120K scheduled maintenance on a Honda crv, the following chart is givenScreenshot_20201205-095309_Drive1080×2220 358 KBDid you have the trans fluid changed at 90k miles?
Did you have the timing belt changed at 105k miles?
My suggestion is to get a price quote from the dealership for the services that are needed, and then to phone a couple of local well-reputed independent shops and get a price quote from them.Purchased this vehicle at 92K in 2017 and trans fluid was changed before purchase. Timing belt was replaced recently as well as brake padsLook in the owners manual to see what is on the schedule .  Otherwise they may try to tell you stuff you don’t really need .   I dont know if you have something  like a timing belt at that mileage but if you do  start saving your money  that is going to be a big chunk  itself.     The big thing is the timing belt  , if that needs to be done then do it .  You dont want that snapping which will ruin the whole engine      Have the spark plugs ever been done ?  Those look like they are on the 120000 mile maintenance . if not then they are due also .  It really depends on what they tell you needs to done .  If you have any comfort at all working on a car then do the simple stuff  like changing the engine air filter and the cabin filter yourself and save a few bucks  as they will charge you like $50 just to do a cabin filter .The 120,000 mile service will cost about $250.Why are you telling me this stuff ?  I did not ask this question , VJ03 did.+1
Additionally, the OP already supplied most of the information that vipergg was asking about.I would do everything listed under the 90/105/120 service intervals that I couldn’t confirm have been done.  Once you have that list get a quote for it.You recently replaced timing belt. So, you asked shop/dealer about next service? They didn’t ask you?There’s no reason to take this 9 year old car to the dealer. They will find all sorts of “issues”, and try to scare you into paying their inflated prices to fix the “issues”.
Take it to a local mechanic and tell them what you want done. It’ll probably be 1/2 the price of the dealer.OP, I thought that all 2011 CRVs came with timing chains, not belts.  (We used to have one)  Are you sure that maintenance schedule is for an '11


 tigger06082000_172761:

OP, I thought that all 2011 CRVs came with timing chains, not belts. (We used to have one) Are you sure that maintenance schedule is for an '11


I think you’re right, from what I can find CRVs had timing chains from about 2002 on.  So the OP needs to find a correct maintenance schedule.
That said, I would want to make sure that all fluids have been changed and the valves adjusted.Yes, timing chain. I checked again and it hasn’t been replaced. Any reliable service mechanic in the Virginia area who doesn’t put a deep hole in the pocket? Thanks for all your invaluable inputsYou don’t need to change the timing chain.

I think Virginia is a rather large area so how far are you willing to go for this routine service ?
Seriously , that is what online rating sites and asking friends , relatives and coworkers where they received good and reasonable   service.I could have asked if he paid $800 for timing belt. And wonders if 100k service is $250? I don’t what what they did for “timing belt” service. Or what he paid. Maybe it was SERP belt?",,,,
97,Problems reading oil,Maintenance/Repairs,47,1.7k,"I have a 2007 Chevrolet Trailblazer and a problem I’ve never had before with any vehicle. This vehicle holds 7 quarts of oil but the dipstick is not reading any oil. I had the same thing happen before I changed it and about 4-5 quarts came out. What would cause the dipstick to not read that any oil is in a vehicle, yet there is plenty in it? This has always been mysterious to me and I’m hoping someone can shed light on the mystery. Thank you all!


 Solved by Bing in post #3 


                It holds 7 quarts but only 5 came out, so it was 2 quarts low?  Often dipsticks will not record any oil when it is two quarts low.  My guess.  Otherwise your dipstick is screwed up.
              
After you put in 7 quarts, does it read full? If so, it may be that the dipstick does not extend down to 3 quarts low.  If it doesn’t read full after 7 quarts, compare it against another correct dipstick.It holds 7 quarts but only 5 came out, so it was 2 quarts low?  Often dipsticks will not record any oil when it is two quarts low.  My guess.  Otherwise your dipstick is screwed up.Consider going to a Chevy dealership and see if an OEM dipstick is still available for your vehicle.  It is possible at some point a substitute dipstick was placed in your engine.
After you changed the oil, refilling with seven quarts of oil, did it not
show  on the dipstick?  Possibly the oil is not draining back from the top end of the engine.


 botard89:

had the same thing happen before I changed it and about 4-5 quarts came out


Then you were 3 quarts low on oil… a VERY bad thing… so the dipstick would show no oil on it because you are NOT supposed to run the engine that low on oil.As I recall, my Miata will only show down to a bit over 1 quart low, after that, it will not show oil.  The distance from full to empty on the dipstick is 0.8 quarts, the dipstick can show maybe half again that amount to the bottom of the dipstick.  You were running that engine with far too little oil in it as others have stated.I had an 03 TB, at 190k miles burned about a quart every 3000 miles. My readings were never off the dipstick, I think 1 quart low would have put it near the bottom of the dipstick, guessing being 1.5 quarts low would have not shown anything on the dipstick.I’ve already checked and it is the original dipstick.I had just got the vehicle and it never read on the dipstick and I was going to do an oil change but only had 5 quarts at the time. I put what I had in it (5 quarts) to see if that filled it up. I learned the capacity later, which was 7 quarts. It never showed on the dipstick with 5 quarts in it. I’m going to put another quart to a quart and a half in it to see if it reads, and if so, where on the dipstick it reads. Thank you.


 botard89:

Is this the vehicle you wanted to modify for more power ?  If so then this is a case of you are trying to run before you can walk.


 botard89:

What would cause the dipstick to not read that any oil is in a vehicle, yet there is plenty in it?


You under filled the crankcase, it is 2 quarts low.The dipstick is marked with 2 small holes or a crosshatched area. Add until the level is betwee. The holes or on the crosshatch.
This is realy basic stuff. Seems you need a lot more study. Reading the owners manual will help. They are available as PDFs from GMs website if you don’t have one.Personally I think that is somewhat irrelevant. You learn things as you go with anything. It was something I overlooked because the vehicle is new to me. Am I to assume you never owned something and learned something new about it? If you didn’t want to answer the question, it’s a forum and you could have kept scrolling or moved to something else.Well as I stated before I added 5 quarts and most stuff I’ve owned took 5 quarts. You’re right. I could use a lot more study. I know a lot about vehicles but it’s not all linear information. I guess another kicker for me is how busy I stay and sadly I didn’t take the time to stay on top of it. Oh well.


 botard89:

Well as I stated before I added 5 quarts and most stuff I’ve owned took 5 quarts.


Did you check it immediately after you changed it? (like you should…) You should’ve known immediately that you didn’t put enough oil inI’ve always been told to run it a little before checking it and let it sit, that it gives it a more accurate reading. I’m guessing that’s not true?


 botard89:

I’ve always been told to run it a little before checking it and let it sit, that it gives it a more accurate reading. I’m guessing that’s not true?


You run it a little while (like a few minutes) for two reasons.  The first is to check for leaks, and the second is to fill the oil filter.  After that you let it sit for few minutes for the oil to drain back down from the lifters, and you can get an accurate reading.That’s what I thought. I checked it immediately after doing just that but honestly my first thought was that maybe the dipstick had been replaced with a different one. Other things had so it was just a curiosity. Plus without knowing the capacity was actually 7 quarts instead of 5, I thought there might have been another problem. I didn’t have 7 quarts at the time, not that it would’ve made the difference because I wouldn’t have put that in there without knowing how much it could actually hold. Not fully understanding the function of this dipstick hasn’t helped. I always thought the dipstick measured the entire content of oil, not just read the level between say 6-7 quarts. I am having to learn as I go, but at least I know now that this was user error and not some other mysterious problem. I appreciate all the people weighing in and everything I learned in the process. I will continue to learn more. Although, I wish I had a more linear way to learn, I’m sure I will fit it all together eventually.  Thanks again.Ok guys lets get a couple of things in line. 1st never do any work on any vehicle maintenance process until you have ALL THE NEEDED SUPPLIES AT HAND!!! you should never run any auto 2 quarts low it causes inadequate oil circulation which causes a lack protection to the bearings and other things.like wearing out crank bearings quickly. So always make sure you have all the things you need to do the job BEFOTPRE you start the job. 2nd ALL vehicle manufacturers require that you presoak the new oil filter by filling it with oil and letting it sit for 10 min estimated so the filter can wik up the oil. After its done wikking the oil then install. This prevents the delay of oil distribution which causes damage to the engine from running it without oil. When you dont wik the filter the engine runs for up to 5 minutes without oil circulation.the dipstick is an estimated oil level not exact. This is why there’s a 1 inch area on it that is marked. There must be oil in this 1 inch area. If there isn’t DO NOT START RUN OR DRIVE THE CAR UNTIL YOU CORRECT IT! ALWAYS refer to your owners manual for the type of oil your car requires for the season you are in and  the capacity of oil needed. New cars need specific types of oil most much lighter viscosity than the older cars so NEVER ASSUME you know what you are doing  because this is the main cause of new cars having the warranty voided and people ending up with a brand new car with a blown engine. The other cause of voided warranty is someone who is not a certified technician doing what they think is maintenance but its not done properly by following the maintenance checklists. Regular joe car owners cannot get hold of the checklists for this reason.the warrantee companies will not carry the warranty on a vehicle that isn’t  maintained by a properly certified technician. This story is a prime example of someone who has no business being under the hood of any car messing around and doing things they have no business trying to do.

denver.cbslocal.com – 10 Dec 20 19



‘Oh No, This Can't Happen Again’: Man Has 2 Kias Stolen In 1 Month 19
Through October, stolen car rates have risen 50.5% compared to the same time period in 2019. According to the City of Denver, crime statistics, stolen cars went from 4,248 in 2019 to 6,394 this year.





I’ll make the same comments as I did, in regards to catalytic converter theft . . .
These thieves should get the death penalty
And the sentence should be carried out that same day
With no provisions for hiring a lawyer, filing an appeal, etc.
These scumbag thieves have no redeeming qualities whatsoever
They’re wasting air and other resources which would be better used by more deserving people
And nobody actually believes they’re committing these crimes to put food on the table . . .
And if you do believe that, I’ve got a bridge or swampland to sell you I have more sympathy for non violent crimes regarding the death penalty/News story said person had car stolen from street parking spot. Then 2 weeks later she dropped off kid at daycare and left keys in car and it was stolen in 30 sec. seems crook was waiting for uh, inattentive drop offs. Had  2 dogs in car. 1 was dropped off 5 miles away and found. 2nd pooch is still missing. So, another person has 2 cars stolen.Stupid woman too lazy to remove the key from her ignition?
Likely both dogs were abandoned by the criminal.  Other hit by car andead.Just because you’re not smart enough to remove the keys from the ignition does NOT mean it’s okay for somebody to steal the car

99,Probability of cylinder head/valve problems versus defective piston rings?,Maintenance/Repairs,17,779,"This is in regards to my 2002 Daewoo Lanos, 1.6L automatic, with approximately 91,000 miles.
This car has run poorly now for over a year, and now that I have more free time, I would like to do something about it–either fix it if it can be fixed, or else junk it and buy a different used car.
The problem is that the engine misfires a lot at idle, and the whole front end shakes violently, but once I get moving it seems to run ok.  There is no visible smoke, no noticeable oil consumption, and the performance seems adequate for this type of car.  It also requires several attempts to start once the engine is turned off for more than 10-15 minutes.
Thus far, I have already replaced the fuel pump (due to an inoperable fuel gauge, which the new fuel pump solved), fuel pressure regulator, and all 4 fuel injectors (due to one injector leaking a lot, and one leaking a little).  None of those steps solved the engine performance issues, and of course I also replaced the spark plugs and ignition wires, etc.
Back in June, I took the car to a professional mechanic, which my employer uses, and he determined that there is an internal problem with the engine, and as a result, the spark plug for cylinder #3 gets oil on the tip, which causes a misfire.  He also determined that two cylinders had approximately 130 psi of compression and two had approximately 150 psi, but the only published specification is that 100 psi is the “service limit” for this engine.  He said that if I wanted this diagnosed further, I could take it to another shop, which one of his friends owns, and they could determine if the engine is repairable.
I am considering now whether it makes more sense to have this engine fully diagnosed…was quoted about $350 to do this, or if it makes more sense to assume the problem is top-end and that a DIY cylinder head replacement will make this engine run properly.  I can get a remanufactured head plus the additional materials needed to do the job for about $650 including tax and shipping.  I would also need to purchase a professional torque-angle tool, about $600, but once purchased, I assume this tool will last for the rest of my life since I’m just a DIYer.
Supposedly, this engine is identical to the 1.6L E-TEC used in the 2004-2008 Chevrolet Aveo, with the only difference being the porting on the head (Lanos uses an aluminum intake manifold, and Aveo uses a plastic intake manifold, and they don’t line up exactly).  So I have read information online regarding engine problems with the 2004-2008 Chevrolet Aveo, and found that valve guide and valve stem seal problems are a known issue, and that a small number of people have reported problems with oil control rings.
Based upon this information, does it make sense to spend $650 on materials and $600 on a specialty tool to replace the cylinder head, without further diagnosis, to spend $350 on further diagnosis, or to just buy a different used car now?  The car is in excellent condition, with no rust or body damage, and I am happy with it, except for the engine problem.There is no evidence that this engine was ever overheated, and the valvetrain is clean, i.e. no sludge or debris under the valve cover.Do a leak-down test on the engine.

TesterThe compression ratio on that engine is 9.6. This means that engine in good condition should have around 190 PSI. A 130 and 100 is on the way out. A 150 means it’s also headed that way; just not  as bad.
In the age of unleaded gasoline and with  low compression on all cylinders odds are the biggest part of the problem is in the piston rings. Oil on the plug tip generally means rings; not cylinder head. Service limits mean nothing and those published specs are incorrect. Sounds like something repeated out of Chiltons or Haynes manuals which are dead wrong and have been wrong for decades. Those publications recycle the same info no matter the car make or engine type. In a word; generic.
The professional mechanic you used should have done a wet compression test at the time he did the dry one and the answer to a ring problem would have been known then and there. If the given numbers take a 20, 30, or 40 PSI jump upwards that means rings. You should not have to spend 350 to figure this out; something that your original guy could have done in a few minutes during the original compression test. Personally, I think a reman head is a waste of money.You also don’t need a torque angle gauge to replace a head . A torque wrench and a protractor will do unless you are going to start rebuilding engines.
Diagnose first, buy parts later.  I don’t understand a mechanic doing a dry compression test and not following it with a wet one unless he discovered the engine was shot with the dry one.Suppose for the sake of argument that defective piston rings are the problem.  How does that result in oil depositing on the spark plug electrode without any loss of oil on the dipstick, nor any visible smoke during a cold start-up?  Also, is it even possible to have worn-out rings on an engine with a cast-iron block, without seeing any visible wear inside the cylinders?I think you need to stop supposing and get that leakdown test done
It’ll answer a lot of questions, and influence your decisions going forward
And forget the idea of spending $600 for that torque wrench . . . it sounds like you’re thinking of buying a professional grade tool which might only be used onceit doesn’t5 take much oil to foul a spark plug.
Short trip driving can mask oil loss by putting unburnt fuel in the oil. The catalytic converter burn up a fair  amount of oil before it fails.
Wear doesn’t always show up as damage, sometimes it is just increased clearance.So I bought the Maddox deluxe compression tester kit and Maddox cylinder leak-down tester kit, and my boss let me take home an old air compressor that we have at the shop which no one has used in years.  The compressor unfortunately has a leak, and will not fill up past 81 psi, so I did not do the leak-down test yet, but I did do the compression test.
I removed all of the spark plugs and the fuel pump relay and disconnected the input to the ignition coil, then one at a time screwed the adapter into each cylinder and had my wife crank the ignition while I counted 6 revolutions of the engine.  The results were:
Dry:
Cylinder 1: 166
Cylinder 2: 171
Cylinder 3: 143
Cylinder 4: 60
Then I took a cap from a can of carburetor cleaner, filled it about 3/4 of the way with new engine oil, and poured this down each spark plug hole, and repeated the test.
Wet:
Cylinder 1: 190
Cylinder 2: 192
Cylinder 3: 177
Cylinder 4: 94Also, here are the spark plugs which I replaced on September 12 to get the car through emissions, they were NGK Laser Iridium, and had less than 4000 miles on them:
20200912_1254411932×2576 1.11 MB
And here are the spark plugs I took out today to do the compression test, NGK V-Power copper core, and have less than 500 miles on them:
20201129_1615431932×2576 1.47 MB
Note than cylinder 3 gets oil on the threads, even though the threads are below the sealing gasket.
Also, the engine performance became markedly worse after I had the timing belt changed, which is to say it ran like new until I had the timing belt changed for maintenance reasons.  I was super-busy at that point in time, and therefore felt it more prudent to pay a shop to do the job than to risk the belt failing and ruining the engine before I would have time to do it myself (4-5 months later).  The engine never really ran properly again after that, and it has gotten worse over time.
Any ideas???Can I presume this Daewoo has hemispherical combustion chamber heads, with the spark plugs located in the middle?
If so, you could remove #4 spark plug and get a scope . . . they’re pretty cheap nowadays . . . and at least take a look at the cylinder walls
here’s a partial cut-and-paste from an alldata cylinder leak down procedure . . .
NOTE: When you adjust the regulator to “zero” the leak-down gauge, the shop air
pressure gauge will read current shop pressure. Shop pressure can be anywhere
between 60-100 psi but it needs to remain constant and steady.
That being said . . . how bad is the leak on that “old air compressor” . . . ?!
If you dial it in to build up to only 70psi, will it “remain constant and steady” . . . ?
If so, you might be able to do that leakdown test
Say . . . this engine doesn’t have adjustable valve lash, does it?

Yes.

Good idea.  I own an inspection camera, which I use for work.  It should be small enough to fit down the spark plug hole.



 db4690:

The leak isn’t huge, it is at the quick-release fitting where the air hose connects.  If the hose is held perfectly straight, it doesn’t leak, but if held at any angle, it does leak.  The fitting is male threaded into the compressor tank, so I assume I could get a replacement, and then the compressor will work properly.


 bcohen2010:

it is at the quick-release fitting where the air hose connects


Can you please post a picture of this fitting?
Unless I’m mistaken, these fittings are easily replaced and available at any home depot, lowes or ace?
Is this a plastic quick-disconnect fitting with a red push release?
I’ve had so-so luck with them, sometimes resulting in a sizable leak unless you find that “sweet spot” . . . exactly what you described, as a matter of fact.  Maybe a better quick-disconnect fitting or a regular fitting, where you have to pull the collar to release?  I’ve not had leakage problems with those, as far as I can recall
according to my source, you don’t have adjustable valve lashI ended up putting the spark plugs back in, reconnecting the fuel pump and ignition, etc.  It was difficult to start the engine, and once started it smoked for several minutes, with the check engine light blinking.  Now, there is something rattling inside the engine, it sounds like a rod knock, but appears to be coming from the cylinder head.
I am starting to reach the conclusion that this car will never run properly unless I replace the engine, and that is really more effort and expense than I want to deal with.  The main concern is that I could shell out $800 to $1000 to replace the engine, but then never succeed in getting the car through emissions again, because it requires a CKP re-learn anytime the engine, harmonic balancer, or crankshaft position sensor is replaced or disturbed; failure to do this will result in a persistant P0300 code and flashing check engine light.  The problem is that no one has the factory scan tool to do that procedure.
There are several low-cost used cars for sale here, so I will probably end up cutting my losses on this one.  This car is ok, but not great, and certainly not irreplaceable.  I have a truck to drive while I wait for something else to come along at a reasonable price for its mileage and condition.
When time permits, I will do the leak-down test in order to gain experience with this procedure.  I will also take apart the engine to see what really happened.There’s enough evidence to point the finger at the engine being bad even without a leak down test. Three cylinders show a ring problem and one shows a valve problem; or the mother of all cylinder/ring problems.
Generally speaking, a very low reading usually means a valve problem but that is not etched in stone. A  horrible cylinder wall/ring problem can also cause very low readings.
One could bring that very low cylinder up to TDC of the compression stroke and apply some air into the spark plug hole. If there’s a valve issue you will hear it hissing out the exhaust pipe or back out of the intake manifold. Smoke can also be used to check this but I assume no access to a smoke machine.
Just an FYI, but after pricing a Snap-On smoke  machine once (ouch…) I made my own on the cheap.
I bought a small stage fog machine, made an adapter for it, and after filling it with Bug Juice it works fine for things like this although the original purpose was vacuum leak checks and EVAP issues. Total cost 60 bucks…So I am still driving this car to work every day.  The engine stopped making noise after the initial run while it was burning off the oil added for the compression test.  I purchased a new air compressor and air hose, and plan to do the leak-down test this weekend.  I have read several websites about how to do this, but I still have some questions:

How do you know if a particular cylinder is at TDC on the compression stroke, and does it really matter as long as the piston is at or near the top?  I assume sticking a piece of copper pipe into the engine while I slowly turn the crankshaft should allow finding TDC or close to it.
How much air pressure is it best to use?  The leak-down tester tool accepts a maximum input of 100 PSI.  Is it best to use something less than that?
Some websites say there is a risk that the introduction of air pressure could cause the engine to turn by itself, which could be dangerous.  Is removing one spark plug at a time the best way to mitigate this risk?
You can use 60 to 100 PSI. Main thing is that the pressure is steady and constant.
Yes it is possible for the engine to rotate over when compressed air is applied. Leaving the other plugs in would not make any difference as the other 3 cylinders would likely have valves open to some degree.
If you get the cylinder on exactly TDC of the compression stroke it should not rotate. A bit one way or the other and it might.
To find compression stroke I use a remote starter switch or have someone very quickly bump the key while I have a thumb on the spark plug hole; or something equivalent to a thumb. When you feel it huff that means stop and rotate by hand the rest of the way with a ratchet/socket.
A piece of copper pipe with marks will work although I tend to use a dial indicator. Using a dial indicator starts leading to the question of at what point do you quit buying tools. I have used a wooden dowel in the past. It will all work; just eyeball any marks carefully. Hope that helps.image1600×1600 115 KB

It is a dull, thunk sound, like u-joints would make in an older car, except this sound seems to come from the place where the transmission connects to the motor, underneath the center console. Mechanics couldn’t reproduce the sound. It runs and shifts just fine, but occasionally feels like the transmission is about to drop!Check your state’s lemon laws, and document, document as you attempt to get this problem corrected.
Take a tape recorder on your drives.I don’t see a Buick LeSabre listed for 2021 so what year is this vehicle ?It’s a 2005, the last year they were madeGood tip! Thanks!

Good tip! Thanks!


I hope you don’t think that the lemon laws will apply to this 15 year old vehicle because they don’t.Put a wrench on the engine to transmission bolts and see if they are lose. Also check the motor and transmission mounts. Check all the engine cradle bolts.

Your 2005 Buick has Front Wheel Drive, and as a result the engine connects to the transmission under the hood, adjacent to the left (?) front wheel, not underneath the center console.   It is entirely possible that you have one or more bad motor mounts or transmission mounts, so I think that you need to seek yet another mechanic.Thanks, but no, I didn’t think they would. But it’s a good thing to know for future reference.Didn’t know that, thanks. I will make another attempt with another mechanic.Thanks. I’m not mechanically inclined, but I will find someone who is and ask them to check those exact things. Thanks for the tip.Well yeah that and I’d have the CV joints checked and the flywheel bolts etc.  At that age could be anything up there coming loose.  Really I think a transmission shop might be more helpful in detecting a drive train noise.Thank you very much. I will add those connections to the list, and also try the transmission shop. Great idea!

Just be sure that you go to an independent trans shop that has been in business for at least 3 years.
Do NOT go to a chain-operated trans shop such as Lee Myles, Cottman, Mr. Transmission, or–the worst of the worst–AAMCO.   They will tell you that you need a new transmission, even if only a relatively minor repair is necessary.Thanks, I will remember that. Generally don’t trust big chains, anyway. And I’m sure the transmission is ok. Had the fluid changed when I first bought the car, thinking that might fix it!",,,,
101,Get rid of power steering?,Maintenance/Repairs,17,676,"Is it possible to just take out the power steering pump and either put in just a pulley  for the existing belt configuration, OR get a short belt to bypass the power steering? I can’t afford to have the rack replaced and the new pump is burning and grinding up. I was adding about a quart a week but in the last few days,  the bottom has fallen out and I lose all the fluid in minutes so the system is running dry.  I don’t care about the power steering but I need those other components driven by the belit to keep running.You can gut the pump and use it as the idler pulley with your existing belt. Remove the vanes that pump the fluid and the pump no longer pumps. It still needs to hold oil, though, to lubricate the bearings. Steering will be heavy.
If the rack itself is leaking this won’t work. Actually, nothing will as the power steering fluid lubricates the rack. If you remove the pump, it won’t be long before the rack binds up and kills the car’s driver.If this is that 2001 Chevrolet Cavalier then it sounds like time to just put it out of your misery .


 Mustangman:

+1
Initially, the steering will be VERY heavy w/o power assist.    After a fairly short period of time, the now-dry rack will not allow you to steer the car, and the result could easily be fatal.
Edited to add:
Even if the OP survives a lock-up of his steering, I have to wonder how he would feel if he caused the deaths of other people.   And, if a forensic examination of his car, post-accident, showed that the power steering had been disconnected/disabled, it is very possible that the legal consequences of an accident could be upgraded to vehicular homicide.  The OP’s plan is just slightly less dangerous than driving with bad brakes.I agree with the others. This is too unsafe. I’m sorry for your financial situation, but I would find a way to get new transportation, or not drive. It’s better than getting killed or living with the thought of being responsible for the death of someone else.This post was flagged by the community and is temporarily hidden.Thanks for the useful reply.Thanks. A couple of years ago I drove this car for 90 days with zero power steering  before that pump burned up.  Sadly, this car is the only thing I have in the world. Not having it run means I will freeze to death.Thanks for the info. Appreciate it.Can you contact a local church group about some financial help?
Even if they don’t publicize it, a lot of churches will help those in dire need, even if the recipients are not members of their congregation.Thanks for the suggestion. I’ll see what I can try and figure out. I might just have to find some  place that sells industrial-size vats of power steering fluid and just keep pouring it in - maybe put a catch pan under the leak and just keep dumping it back in the top.I understand the concerns about expense, and some things on a vehicle you can skimp on and not mess with safety too much.  But things like steering, tires, brakes, need to work properly for your safety and the safety of those out in public with you.
Even if you get one that works form a junkyard or something, that is better than running without power steering on a vehicle designed for it.Yep. Thanks. That is exactly what I would tell me if I didn’t know how bad my situation was. It is all about survival on an hour-to-hour basis out here right now.kinda hard to survive when you are plummeting off a cliff or into a tree because you cannot steer.
try the church idea if things are that dire.  It really is important that this be fixed properly, or you find a different mode of travel.Are you looking at used or new replacements?  Used PS pumps my be cheap enough that you can afford the job. Are you sure the leak is in the PS pump?  If it’s in the rack, you might need to address that too.If you don’t need the car to move and are using it just for shelter and heat, you don’t need to fix the rack. Just gut the pump but you will need to bring gas to the car in gas cans.
If you will permit a nosy question, why is your situation so desperate?  Are you absolutely unemployable?Year, make, model, and engine?
Is the problem with the rack? Is the fluid leaking out of the rack and that’s why you want to bypass the pump? Have you tried a big bottle of Lucas power steering stop leak?I do not think miracle in a bottle will work, the rack has a massive leak and the power steering pump to go next. One could hope the rack is good and it is a bad connection to the rack from the pump. I had that happen, the line was rusted out at the rack under a boot, but it was a $800 fix to replace the lines, 03 Trailblazer.",,,,
102,1933 Frazier Nash & Britain’s coming ban on fuel-burning vehicles,General Discussion,69,1.8k,"Today’s  ‘Marketplace’, 4 minutes:

Britain has moved up its ban on fuel-burning vehicles.  A motorhead with a 1933 Frazier Nash approves.Not that surprising. A ban on new gasoline powered vehicles doesn’t affect an owner or collector of vintage models. Wait til they come for his Nash.Wait until they tell Brian Johnson of AC/DC that he can’t drive his blower Bentley any more. Anything over 40yrs old is exempt from road tax in the UK.This reminds me of the so called “ban” on new incandescent light bulbs when some folk were panic buying the old stock.
Nobody “came after” my 150 watt floodlights but it did create an increased demand which greatly reduced the cost of the more efficient CFL and LED bulbs. Although the initial cost of the LED bulbs are still a little more expensive, my savings in energy cost (150 watts vs 15 watts), longer life and fewer ladder climbs make them a “no brainer”.
With cars I see the same thing happening. A similar push away from the current 100 year old gasoline technology will increase demand, reducing costs and increasing the investment in technology and infrastructure to the point where buying an “alternatively fueled”  new car will also be a “no brainer”.
And I suspect that by 2040 my grandchildren will be looking at my then 90 year old MG and asking, “Where’s the power plug?”, “Why is it making so much noise?” and “What’s that pipe coming out of the tail?”Of course here in the USA we heard ‘someone’ promise to bring back coal, but I am still seeing diesel-electric locomotives pulling freight trains.

There was an amusing episode of Star Trek Voyager where they found an old Model T farm truck and had similar reactions. 
They’re not going to come for your classic cars. They won’t have to. As demand for gasoline drops, eventually it’s going to go away, at least at anything resembling an affordable price point. You won’t be running your old gas classic because you won’t be able to buy gas anymore, and that will be pure market forces dictating it.
Most of us who have old cars aren’t fortunate enough to have some 6-figure numbers-matching trailer queen, and so we won’t have a problem swapping in an electric drivetrain. I’d do it right now on my old MR2 if it were affordable. Same for the CRX.
I’ve never been one who was enamored by the “vroom vroom” aspect of the car scene. Loud does not equal fast, which is why my quiet old-man-mobile Lexus stomps the kids driving Civics with fart-tip exhaust pipes when I don’t even realize we’re supposed to be racing. So if I can make that MR2 faster and quieter with one mod? Sign me up!Gasoline is going to still be around and available for probably all of our lifetimes, maybe gone by the time our kids/grandkids are old.
Simply put, there are just too many gasoline powered vehicles out there in use today for the “spigot” to just suddenly shut off one day.
I do have hope that the electric transition has begun, though. When I was a kid, battery powered anything was a joke. Now I have an battery/electric push lawnmower that I’d put up against any Briggs and Stratton mower. Honestly, if I had to buy a car tomorrow, I’d seriously consider an electric car, based on my own needs in a vehicle.
The change is coming and has already begun.As demand for gas drops, it will go away. That’s what I was thinking.


 Beancounter:

This reminds me of the so called “ban” on new incandescent light bulbs when some folk were panic buying the old stock.


A friend of mine bought an incredible quantity of incandescent bulbs about 8 years ago because he didn’t want to have to buy “new-fangled” energy-efficient bulbs.   However, this is a guy who lives in semi-darkness because “electricity is too expensive”.   The result is that he has used only a few of his stock-piled bulbs, and one of his closets is so filled with incandescent  bulbs that he can’t put any clothing in there.  
A few months ago, when I asked him if he still thinks that he did a wise thing by stockpiling hundreds of old 60-watt bulbs, his answer was, “Well, I could sell them”.
At last report, his total sales were…
ZERO.I completely agree with you.
I think that by 2040 gasoline will still be available but eventually only for marine and farm use.
Electric conversions are already underway, the vintage Jag XKE that the Prince and Megan Markel drove away was an electric conversion and as it continue it’ll certainly become cheaper.
And as far as the Zoom Zoom noise goes, well for a few bucks I’m sure someone will make a bundle duplicating it as an add on.
But the things that can’t be duplicated will still exist. The freedom of your own personal escape machine, the style of something unique and joy of “modding” (Overclocking) will still survive.
I suspect that one day our children or grandchildren will pull up to Checkers boasting about their MR with a 1,200  Kwatt drive next to a  Chankhai  Sport…
Just hoping that  they were smarter than we were.

There are already laws requring they make some kind of noise for the safety of the deaf.

That might be true for the cheapo leaf blowers, but my Ryobi leaf blower–with a 40 watt battery pack–easily runs for 20-25 minutes.   It is as powerful as most gas-powered blowers and it is a LOT quieter, in addition to not producing any noxious fumes.
Because I also have a 40-watt Ryobi weed whacker, I have two battery packs, so one battery pack is always recharged and ready to go.   If I need to blow leaves for more than 20-25 minutes, I just swap battery packs and recharge the depleted one for a couple of hours.Saw this while skimming through a variety of news sites.

103,Bumping noise when turning left,Maintenance/Repairs,10,5.5k,"When making a 30 degree or greater turn to the left, there’s a low bumping/thumping, repeating noise. Sounds sort of like hard taps on your chest. The frequency of the sound increases with the speed. As soon as the vehicle straightens out, the noise stops.


 Also, the noise isn’t audible (at least, not to my ears) from outside the vehicle. I haven’t been able to pinpoint its location.

 Tire problem?Sounds like a CV joint…what kind of car, etc.?I agree with the CV joint as a prime candidate.
Constant Velocity joints allow a smooth torque transition through a bendable joint. They vary somewhat in detail, but are all (simplified) basically a ball in a socket with grooves and balls in between the ball and socket. The balls in the grooves allow the main ball to pull the socket along with it as it rotates and as the joint bends. If they develop internal problems, including dryness, the internal parts can make thumping sounds as the move within the ball & socket grooves.I’d just read something similar. Sorry about the lack of vehicle details – 99 Corolla.You can count this as a third vote for worn-out CV joints being the likely problem.
While the one on the left axle is probably the one making noise, on an 11 year old car you might as well replace both of them at this point, as the one on the right axle will probably fail soon, as well.I agree 100%.Same here…CV joints.I associate “thumps” with ball-joint wear. When the wheels are turned, it puts more of a side load on the ball-joints, and any wear could show itself as a jerk. An alignment shop can check this out.
You could have someone position themselves near the front of the car, and observe the tires as you turn doughnuts (slowly) in a parking lot. If one tire/wheel jerks side-wise as the turn is made, that could be a tie-rod end or ball-joint looseness.I have a similar issue with my 04 Silverado. It makes a thumping sound when turning left. It doesn’t do it when I make full left turns, it’s only when I turn the wheel halfway left. Then straight and right are fine. I’ve done the front brakes, replaced both CV axles, and it needed new ball joints (I’ve owned the truck for about 2-3 months now with 140k on it). Its still making the same thumping sound. I can, most of the time, feel the thump on my floor board.Shoot. I didn’t know this as posted 10 years ago haha.

 DebY38:

Note: There was a Knock sensor recall which we brought it in to the dealorship back in May where they input something into the computer to correct an issue


The engine computer software was updated to use the knock sensor to detect connecting rod bearing failure, its original use is to detect detonation or pre-ignition.
When engine bearing failure is detected the engine power is reduced allowing you to limp to a dealer for engine replacement.I’m also curious as to which color light is being referred to. Yellow CEL or the red lack of oil pressure light which I’m sure is what Mustangman is getting at.
That brings up secondary questions. When was the last oil change and when was the last time the hood was raised to check the motor oil level?
Note the OP apparently bought this as a used car and being serviced on time for the last 23 months does not mean it was serviced on time in the preceding months and years.The light was not red.  And it did not stay on but blinked on and off.
Vehicle was in cruise control at the time the engine light started to blink. Tapped the brake to exit cruise control. Stepped on throttle and engine was miminally responsive.
In answer to the other question:  The oil change was done within the last 2000 miles. We kept to the schedule set up for this car by the dealer.
Kia dealership says all test results implicate engine failure.  We are awaiting a response for a new engine by manufacturer. This will take some time as the dealership says Korea does not respond promptly to requests of this nature.  However, the dealership did provide us with a loaner vehicle until they hear back from them.No guarantee on Kia spring for a new engine, but good luck.


 DebY38:

The oil change was done within the last 2000 miles.


That’s good, but have you been checking the oil level in the meantime?

If the CEL was flashing, your engine may have gone into limp mode to protect itself.

106,"Car won’t move in drive, reverse, or neutral",Maintenance/Repairs,45,1.4k,"I had just finished working out and got in my car to go home when I noticed an unusual smell in the car, I thought nothing of it and drove home, when I got home I put the car in reverse to park the car and heard a grinding noise  from the driver side wheel. Then the car stopped moving altogether, I hear the car shift but it will not move, not in drive, reverse, neutral or any of the other gears. When I put the car in drive the car attempts to move a little but then nothing, after that if I press down the gas peddle ill hear a noise coming from the driver side wheel and then the exhaust will start smoking (I’m not sure whether is water or coolant i have no idea what it is). I can’t check the trans fluid because the car is not on level ground, and im pretty sure it’s not the transmission because it doesn’t move in neutral , I had also recently changed both the transmission fluid, and filter. Before this my car would sometimes loose power and vibrate uncontrollable when slowing down and accelerating from a stop, it would also do the same when going up a hill. I was just about to replace the fuel pump before this happened. The car starts fine but it just won’t move, it is a 1995 buick park avenue, does anyone have any suggestions as to what this is.A front wheel drive car won’t move if one of the half shafts have failed.

TesterPlus 1 to Tester.  Get under and take a quick look.  Look for ball bearings on the driveway.  Happened to me and would continue going forward until I put it in reverse then all the bearings fell out.  Doesn’t explain the smell though.20201203_0936153024×4032 1.05 MB is this, what you’re talking about, I suspected it but I have no idea why it would cause my car to smoke.I don’t know either unless it was a rubber smell.  There is also an inner joint closer to the transmission.  Hope its not the transmission.  Gonna have to tow it anyway so the shop will let you know after an hour or so.20201203_102626|666x500 19  here are some more pictures I took, I’m just trying to make sure that I have a good idea of what the problem is before towing the car to a mechanic so I don’t get ripped off. Does anyone know why the exhaust could be smoking.Yea but im confident its not the transmission, it doesn’t move in neutral. It has to be a problem with the front wheels, cause the back wheels aren’t locked.That looks like a steering rack boot and it’s leaking. Yes it can cause smoke and no, replacing the boot will not fix the leak.
As for the grinding and not moving, another possibility is that the splines in one of the front hubs may be stripped out. You need to think back as to whether anyone has been into the hub assembly or replaced a CV axle in the past and maybe left the CV axle nut loose.


 Gitau.N.brian_172747:

cause the back wheels aren’t locked.


The back wheels are not locked because they don’t have any connection to the transmission . You do know that you only have front wheel drive don’t you ?
And if you think a shop is going to overcharge then find one that you do trust. Ask relatives or friends where they have received good service.The last pic is the CV boot and nothing obvious there but that may or may not mean anything.I recently got the front brakes and rotors changed, so they might have messed around with it.Yea but like it said the car doesn’t move in neutral Either, which disengages the transmission. I’m just trying to get a good idea of what the problem is so I can start figuring out what I need to do, if its something I could fix at home and avoid paying labor fees ill be glad to do it, if its something serious then I need to know what it could be so I can ask around a few shops and see which would be best for my car.20201203_0939432640×1980 943 KB  this is something I also noticed while under the car i have no idea what car part this is but its in rough shape, does anyone have any idea what this is.20201203_0939502640×1980 672 KB  here’s where its connected to.That’s a transmission mount, and it’s broken.
TesterOk thanks that helps me out with one problem. I think I have a clear understanding of what the problem is or could be. Does anyone have any idea whats coming out of the exhaust, its white smoke and a liquid that stains the road.What year Buick?
Tester1995 Park avenue baseIts a 95.
When you say it doesn’t move in neutral, are you saying that when you try to push it, it is locked up?  Otherwise not going anywhere in neutral would be normal.Yea I put it in neutral and tried to push it and I didn’t budge. Its worth mentioning the car was on an inclined surface and we were trying to push the car down the incline and it didn’t move.",,,,

An Abandoned Bridge to Nowhere in Ohio 24
The Hillandale Bridge was built for a housing development that was never completed.





Interesting!  Turns out there are quite a few:
Bridge to nowhere - Wikipedia 3
I remembered all the controversy about the plans for one in Alaska, $400 million, luckily it got cancelled.Back in the early 60s the TVA spent years and countless millions building a bridge over a river in MS. In 1970s I went to MS to visit some relatives and on the way into town over that bridge noticed that a new bridge was being built right next to the new one that I was on and which had just been opened in the past few years.
I asked a cousin what that was all about and it turned out that in all of those years of design and construction no one had questioned whether or not the bridge was going to be tall enough to allow tug boats to go underneath. After it was completed THEN they decide it should have been taller.
So the new bridge adjacent to the open one was being constructed about 10 feet taller. My assumption was that once the new taller bridge was finished they would demolish the shorter one.Here in NH and MA we have a hard enough time getting the state to fix the bridges we have or build a bridge that is actually needed. I’ve seen bridges in NH and MA that are being supported by a telephone pole because the cross beam had rusted out. It was that way for YEARS before they finally replaced it. Not even sure the couple I saw near Rochester NH have ever been replaced.Back in the '70s, Connecticut had a severe financial crisis, and they simply stopped all highway and bridge maintenance.   The result was… really bad.
Their “solution” to prevent people from suing for vehicle damage was to post signs stating that anyone driving on those highways and bridges did so at their own risk.   However, the print on those signs was more or less the size of a 16 font, and motorists would not be able to read them!
One day, while I was stuck in a traffic jam and was sitting on the passenger side of my friend’s car, I was actually able to read the micro-sized text of the legislation exempting CT from liability resulting from their crappy roads.
I have no idea whether their legislative gambit worked, but the existence of those signs was nothing short of bizarre.I remember those “road legally closed” signs.  That was before I-95 collapsed in Norwalk and killed and injured quite a few.  50 years ago on the island of Jamaica they used to put up signs that said “You have been warned”.  That’s all.  What, if you kept going, the Prime Minister was going to give you a dope slap?

In MA maybe a decode ago now…Funny/Sad story.
One of the Cross beams on I-93 that expands the Merrimack river in Andover MA fell into the river. Not the main beam, but one of few hundred cross beams.
The head of Department of Transportation for MA came out with a public statement saying. “The public isn’t in any danger. There are very few boats that use that portion of the river so very unlikely someone will get hurt.”
I couldn’t believe he actually said it.
Then in NH about the same time frame…the head of the NH’s department of transportation that was in charge of bridges made the public statement - “People should give thanks every time they cross a bridge in NH that it didn’t collapse on them.”Remember when the bridge over the Niantic river collapsed?My favorite was the Silver Bridge in Ohio.  Like the Minnesota I 35 bridge that collapsed there was no redundancy in the structures, so one failure and the bridge would come down.  That was engineering back in the late 50’s and early 60’s.  Seems kinda silly now for bridge design where now there are multiple redundancies in the designs.


 Bing:

there was no redundancy in the structures, so one failure and the bridge would come down


I think the same problem existed on the Genoa, Italy, bridge that collapsed in 2018.And, of course, there is the Tacoma Narrows bridge, almost brand new, that failed due to resonant amplification of the small vibrations from a brisk wind.  The movies are a favorite in physics classes.I was a cad person, heard a story of plans for a bridge that the draftsman forgot to turn on a layer, luckily someone notice something missing on the plans when they went to start construction.


 Barkydog:

That’s why there are checks and reviews. Upper management HATES the review process, but they know (at least the good ones) it’s necessary. Some systems I’ve worked on -  the final review process could take MONTHS…and well worth it. I have worked on systems where the review process was missed or shortened…and EVERY SINGLE TIME there were problems. Before I took this job as director of Software Development I told the VP of engineering and President that if they want to shorten or remove this vital final review process…then I walk. That was over 10 years ago. They understand it.
The state and federal Govt have a very hard time understanding this.

That video was shown to every sophomore engineering students attending my alma mater to drive home what can happen if you don’t consider ALL the issues in your design!  Things can still happen. Remember one construction job we had to change the grading plans, the building came out a foot low. Architectural plans had t/f, to him meaning top of floor, construction company thought it meant top of foundation.


 Barkydog:

Things can still happen.


Of course they can…AND WILL…but the goal is to minimize those issues. And engineering team not following Best Practices is a lawsuit waiting to happen.A young (under 40) lady I know is a Structural Engineer specializing in bridges, working for an engineering firm. Pretty much everything from new construction and maintenance on everything from Bay Bridges, culvert bridges to the restoration of wooden covered bridges.
Lots of stories but if you want to be safe:

Be sure your State hires outside Professional Engineers. (Screw the politicians, a business doesn’t want to be sued or have their license revoked)
Pay the darned taxes - Maintenance costs money, nothing lasts forever and it takes money to maintain and replace these things, many of which are 50-60 years old now and were built when your grandpa’s Packard was still the cat’s pajamas.

Bottom Line is that we’ve been coasting on what our parents and grandparents (Eisenhower) built so if we want safe roads and bridges we’re going to have to pony up, pay our fair share and vote for higher taxes to pay for what we’ve been given.

Yes of course but the question always is what is necessary and what is C priority to deal with the latest fads in road and intersection design.  We’re putting in an underground deer crossing so that the deer will not be hit crossing the road.  Just hope they read the signs.I majored in math as an undergraduate. My Differential Equations prof used the Tacoma Narrows bridge as an example when we studied 2nd order diffyq’s and resonance.",,,,

Thank you.The same paste you would use between a computer’s CPU and it’s heatsink. @cwatkin might know where to get it.I just got this.  Sorry I have been REALLY busy with work due to COVID-19.
Anyway, heatsink compound comes in many forms.  You probably don’t need the most expensive stuff or the hard set type.  I would probably get the white ceramic based stuff since it won’t crack with vibration and isn’t super expensive.  I don’t know what volume you will need but you might need multiple tubes.  This stuff should work.
One other thing…  What is your max working temp?  http://www.arcticsilver.com/arctic_alumina.htm 1  It is rated for 125C/257F for extended periods.  It will not work as effectively if run above these temps for long.  http://www.arcticsilver.com/arctic_alumina.htm 1
Arctic Silver 5 has a higher temp rating.  http://www.arcticsilver.com/as5.htm 1
I think I would do the AS5 personally due to the higher heat rating and the fact it is based on silver.  12g is about the size of a typical injection syringe so you may need many of these.  https://www.ebay.com/itm/Arctic-Silver-5-Thermal-Paste-12-grams-CPU-Heat-Sink-Thermal-Compound-AS5-12G/170749489791?epid=13035044138&hash=item27c176727f:g:IhgAAOSwfedeRfjW 2

My main concern is that the mechanical vibration and excess heat of automotive applications might not work well with something designed around computers.  I really think it should be good enough for a block heater though.
Many of my automotive projects have been on hold due to a crazy work schedule but I have a few I will get back to once I get a tad more time.Hey Conor. Nice to see you, it’s been a while. Hope you’re staying safe and healthy. Thanks for helping out.Maybe I don’t remember correctly, the block heaters I had installed in ND used a molly bolt type thing and a gasket or pressure or o-ring to fit into the hole from a removed freeze plug. Any type of caulk to hold it in place will probably fail, and worrying about heat conducting sounds ridiculous in my book, as the heater  element is immersed in the coolant, and sure it only got to -40, but was told the wattage was about the same as a 100 watt bulb. If you are looking at a magnetic mount don’t waste your time and money on it. Looks like NAPA is 400 watt  https://www.napaonline.com/en/p/KAT11461?partTypeName=Engine+Heater&keywordInput=block+heater 6Thank you.
This heater inserts into an existing dry hole in the metal block.
Instructions warn thathelement may getoo hot and burn out if theat is not pulled away due to any gaps.
The problem withe magnetic heater is that when I get home in the middle of the night, it is a mess reaching under the slush-dripping vehicle to attach ito the oil pan.
Now using a 250-watt outdoor flood light bulb mounted straight up on a 2x4 slid under the oil pan.   A bedsheet from Goodwill covers the hood andrapes down over the grill.When I ordered a car with the carb yet, I would always order the block heater and heavy duty cooling.  The block heater was the best option for cold weather.  With computers and fuel injection, it is not a problem anymore.  Years ago a heavy hitter lady at work insisted someone stole her magnetic heater in our parking garage.  Like who would do that?  My investigation went no where but she couldn’t believe that she lost it on the road somewhere.  Block heater installed by dealer yes.  Cord hanging through the grill for easy plug in.  Heated garage better if its that cold.  Just IMHO.


 Bing:

Ha!    I found her magnetic heater and used it 2 years until it burned out.
Too expen$ive to heathe garage.
Want justhemergencyehiclengine warm - no time to let it warm before under load.For high heat applications like this I suggest using silicone materials. At work we use silicone gaskets or adhesives doped with thermally conductive powders.  They aren’t cheap, but the do the job. Basically they fill the air gaps. Air is a great insulator. Thermal greases work the same way, except they don’t cure. Make sure you clean the surfaces well before applying the thermally conductive material.Just curious why the aversion to the tried and true freeze plug block heater? So if I understand correctly your option is just heating the metal block, and the cold is going to waste most of the heat in the exterior metal, please enlighten me. I have had to clean old dried up heat sync paste for computer processors enough to think you are making things more difficult than needed.My recommendation is to throw away whatever it is that you have and go to the dealer to have a block heater installed.  I’m sure the cost is more now but I had to have one replaced and it cost something like $25.The last quote I got was $135 to install a block heater. DIY cheaper of course.

Letsuck recommended using theater which inserts into the hole in the block.
Theat should diffusenough through the aluminum and also heathe coolant.
The coolant emersioheater is fine,xcept for the mess and having to replace coolant after installation.

Who is Mr. Letsuck?  At any rate, are you trying to heat the actual engine metal?  Some heaters heat the coolant, some heat the oil, but never heard of trying to heat just the metal.  A gallon of coolant costs maybe $20.  Just in my opinion anyway.  Don’t need it anyway with Fuel injection and my garage rarely goes below 40 degrees.

The outdoor floodlight in a weatherproof socket on the 2x4 stud, is aimed straight up.   It is about 1 inch from the oil pandoes a good job.
The sheet keeps mucheat in thengine compartment.
If the floodlight bulb ever shatters, no sparkshould reach the sheet.There would be no need for any type of heatsink compound on that freeze plug engine block heater.  This works more like a water heater element based on the picture.  The heater element is actually in the coolant.  I was picturing something that fit into a recess or flat surface of the block and needed something to conduct heat.  The NAPA unit pictured is immersed in the coolant.  A water heater element will burn out if run dry as well.  I suspect this is much the same except that many water heaters run at 4500W or more.
You might put a thin coating of RTV around that O-ring for extra security against leaks.  I personally like the black RTV.
Yes, I have been quite busy.  Everyone in the IT world is swamped right now.  Demand for laptops, printers, etc. is now about quadruple of normal with everyone trying to work from home.  Scammers/hackers also realize people are home and not always the most secure so they have been targeting people working from home or bored on social media.  Between setting people up and fixing all the damage caused by the scammers, I have been extremely swamped.  Then there are the people going to school from home plus the home entertainment aspect of tech these days.
Anyway, I have been staying healthy so that is the good news.  I have to have been exposed so many times and just not been aware based on how much I have been out and all the various places I have been going.  IT pretty much fits into every definition of an essential worker I have read so there was no slowing down or staying in.
I did buy a project somewhat on topic with this subject, thinking I was going to be stuck at home and needing something to work on.  It has an engine block heater.  Anyway, I bought a surplus short bus that had come from a local school district not long before to make into a camper.  It is a 1996 GM G30 6.5 Diesel with a 12 ft box.  I got a deal since everyone was in a panic and not buying but haven’t had enough time to work on it myself.  Anyway, I have gone through and changed the transmission fluid, coolant, oil, and some other things I always do when I get something new.  It came from the southernmost part of my state where it doesn’t snow so rust was minimal.  I know the GM 6.5 isn’t the greatest but this isn’t going to be a daily driver and for those who say “It is only a 300,000 mile engine”, it only has 95,000 miles so has a lot of life left.  I am going to do the PMD relocate and fix a few other things that these engines are known for lacking.  This is my first diesel so I am still learning.  It is a non-turbo by the way so not a powerhouse but good enough for what I do.  It did come from a flat part of my state but has the “hill” gearing so I am happy about that.I see what is going on here.  Someone is being penny wise and pound foolish.  Scrap the computer heatsink compound.  Just throw money away on a wasted electric bill and risk causing a fire in the process.  I also call this behavior “saving yourself poor”.
Either get a dipstick heater or a coolant heater like the one linked.  This hairbrained idea will waste more electricity in a month than just paying to do it right from the start.",,,,
109,Brake bias on OEM cars,General Discussion,8,569,"Hello folks,
Quick question about how OEM brake bias is set up on cars. I understand that old cars used to have the ‘proportioning valve’ that would help control the HYDRAULIC brake bias (which nowadays is replaced by EBD), but I would like to know the actual brake bias as in how much more front bias would a large 6 piston caliper have over a small 4 or 2 piston caliper. I understand that brake bias hydraulically generally stays the same (unless EBD/ABS is enabled, meaning 50/50 until a wheel locks up) but what I’m asking is basically how would you calculate a car’s true brake bias using caliper size and piston width, etc?
Thanks!


 zinophfragment_163832:

but what I’m asking is basically how would you calculate a car’s true brake bias using caliper size and piston width, etc?


Why would you worry about this ?  And what would you do with that information anyway ? Don’t you think the people who designed the vehicles would put the braking system at the best for most conditions.Brake bias requirements are a rather significant calculation based on the car’s geometry and center of gravity height and front rear location. No car is 50/50, none. Not even a 911 which has the engine behind the rear axle.
Now the commanded bias these days, applied by the master cylinder, is designed to balance the car for light to medium braking. Under heavy braking the ABS is used to prevent the rear brakes from ever braking harder than the fronts. That is a federal requirement. No prop valve is needed.
The mechanical bias, the 3rd part of this, is the pressure area and type of calipers and the diameter of the rotors front to rear.
This probably creates more questions for you than it answers. There are books on the subject. One written by a friend of mine named James Walker Jr. Google it if you want a deep dive.
Basically you can’t calculate brake bias only with caliper features and dimensions.

Why would you worry about this ?


This is Car Talk. OP is talking about cars. Why are you upset about this? OP gives no indication that they are “worried” about this issue. Maybe they’re just curious and thought they’d ask a question of people who might be able to answer. What’s wrong with that?Are you planning on performing some modifications to your car’s brake system?Actually I’ve never seen a vehicle with 50/50 brakes. Front rotors and calipers are usually larger on the front of FWD vehicles while RWD trucks have a wide bias range. And early proportioning valves merely delayed the front brakes being actuated until a fixed threshold of pressure was met on the rear or pedal travel exceeded a pre set limit.
I recall Dodge incorporating a rear proportioning valve that was proportional depending on the loaded weight determined by a lever connected to the rear axle and the frame.
A critical but inconspicuous component in brake bias is the relative diameter of master cylinder bores and wheel/caliper piston diameter and count. A great deal of bias mathematics are involved with those relationships alone.


 Rod-Knox:

Front rotors and calipers are usually larger on the front of FWD vehicles while RWD trucks have a wide bias range.


Doesn’t matter if it’s FWD or RWD…when you brake the vehicles weight shifts toward the front of the vehicle…thus the need for larger brakes.

Understanding Weight Transfer - Driver's Uni Video Tutorial #5
Weight transfer is a fundamental topic to understand to be fast on track. Our video tutorial examines what weight transfer is and how it affects your car.








 MikeInNH:

vehicles weight shifts toward the front of the vehicle…thus the need for larger brakes.


Absolutely true!
Even in rear engine cars with significantly weight more static weight on the rear wheels!  Porsche 911 has fantastic braking capability… but the front rotors are still larger because roughly 55-60% of the braking is done by the front wheels at maximum braking. The even loading of the tires makes for VERY short stopping distances.
A FWD car, with its heavy front weight bias, can easily get to 90% of the braking on the front axle since so much shifts forward under max braking. The FWD car will never beat the stopping distance of an equal weight and tire sized rear or mid engine car for stopping distances because the front tires have far more work to do…
All because tires aren’t linear. Increase the load on the tire by 20% and you’ll only get about 18% more grip. Increase it 40% and you’ll only get about 32% more grip.Well for sure @Mustangmanand @MikeInNH are correct but then beyond family sedans and high performance sports cars there is a world of vehicles with their own particularities. I once had a customer with about a dozen “roach coaches” which were at the limits of their designed load with the heating and cooling systems and well beyond once the food and drinks were tossed on.  I won’t bore anyone with the details but getting the trucks brakes up to the job was a learning experience for me and I feel sure a great many shops have dealt with problems as difficult as I faced then and worse.",,,,

111,Is It Possible For An O2 Sensor To Work Well When Cold But Then Malfunction When Hot?,Maintenance/Repairs,19,526,"Just curious. Any of you ever deal with a faulty O2 sensor before?I haven’t…but they do fail. And yes they may work fine until heated up.Many times.
The Check Engine light turns on with an O2 sensor code.
TesterI dont have any codes yet. 2011 Camry LE 2.5L L4 6 Cylinder.Then why are you worried about it.
O2 sensors can/do go bad. I’ve only had to replace 1 O2 sensor on all the vehicles we’ve owned…most with well over 300k miles.
Don’t worry about it til it happens. Based on my experience it probably won’t ever happen@MikeInNH the car is hestitating on acceleration. That cant be good no matter what. Thats why im worried about it.

There could be a dozen reasons why it’s hesitating. But if the O2 sensor is bad the OBD-II system should detect it and display a code.

Shop Guess ----> O2 Sensor or Fuel Injector


Take it to a different shop.
Tester@Tester I just threw away $100. How can I avoid throwing away money at the next shop? Mind you this was a highly rated shop on Angie’ List  Perhaps im just a fool and dont know how to avoid sharks.Then you just wasted a $100.
A good shop can tell you what’s wrong.
Not guess.
Tester@Tester How do you find a good shop?Ask family, friends, co-workers, etc…
TesterYes but no code.  Just commanded a rich mixture, like 15 mpg to 27 mpg.Actually just the opposite.  O2 sensors have to heat up before they work.  That is why your engine uses a default fuel trim when cold.  It’s called open loop.  When the engine heats up, it goes into closed loop.  Many O2 sensors are heated so they begin to work sooner.
Edit: you paid a diagnostic fee.  If they just read the code and made a guess, they ripped you off.  You could have had that done for free at most car parts stores, i.e AutoZone.  They should have looked up the diagnostic procedure for the code in the factory service manual or all data and followed all the steps.  That will, in most cases, narrow down to the actual defect.
If you go to another shop, ask them exactly what they are going to do for their fee.  You might also ask the mechanic you just used what he did beside hook up a code reader.@kieth There are no engine codes. I had 2 mechanics check the with scanner. The first mechanic is my friend. He’s got decades under his belt with cars. He did a live read while I drove the car. We parked the vehicle and he showed and explained everything in the reader. But no codes.
The second mechanic is the guy who did my diagnostic today. He seemed shady and only guessed what the problem could be.
So I called another shop today. ASE certified. I told them the diagnostic I paid for failed to nail the problem. I asked this ASE shop if they could diagnose it, I would leave the car with them. But that I dont want to pay for another “I DONT KNOW”
Im not throwing $100 paper airplanes on guesswork. I get it. Car repair is HARD labor, but being honest shouldnt be HARD labor either.
So frustrating


 ArgosNoble:

I would trust the mechanic with decades of experience over a ASE certified mechanic with only a couple years experience.Right now you are concentrating on fuel delivery essentially. How about considering whether or not there could be a vacuum leak?
A vacuum leak below the throttle plate will generally cause a rough idle although that could be subtle.
A vacuum leak above the throttle plate will not be noticeable at idle but could cause a hesitation but so  could a leak below the throttle plate.
Best and easiest way to check for a vacuum leak below the plate is with a vacuum gauge. That will not tell you where a leak is; only if one exists.
A vacuum leak also has an effect on the MAF sensor and since air filters are dinked around with quite often it might be a good idea to check the simple stuff like air intake boots, clamps, and PCV hoses.Might be helpful to look at the fuel trim #s at idle and while driving.


 ArgosNoble:

You said in an earlier post that the shop told you there was a pending code.  A pending code is a code, it just hasn’t tripped the check engine light yet.  A pending code can be used for further trouble shooting the problem.",,,,
112,DIY yoke replace or not?,Maintenance/Repairs,1,191,"I have a 97 chevy k2500
While driving down the hwy, sheared off one of the bolts thats holds the ujoint and drive shaft to the rear differential. Needless to say it killed the ujoint and bent the driveshaft.
Upon trying to extract the sheared off bolt from the yoke, I realized how buggered up the yoke was!
The guy at the drive train shop that’s working on my drive shaft said he had a replacement yoke and that I can take off the old one and put the new one on myself as long as I don’t overtorque it and make sure it spins by hand still.
Now my retired mechanic buddy says I really shouldn’t fool with the yoke myself and have a shop put it on bc of the gears inside.
I thought the yoke was more or less just a bracket to connect the shaft to the differential?
I attached a picture. To take the yoke off, does one just unbolt the nut in the middle or do you fool with those 6 bolts also?
Thank you much in advance!
IMG_20201210_165810127_HDR3456×4608 2.02 MBThere’s crush sleeve on the pinion shaft that requires the proper torque when the yoke is reinstalled.

What I do in this situation is use a dial type torque wrench with an indicator when removing the nut.

Then when I go to tighten the nut,  I add 1 ft/lb to the torque that was required to loosen it.

114,Mechanic “forgot” to empty old oil and added full Amt of new on top,Maintenance/Repairs,26,1.4k,"Help!
I’m going out of town this week so I stopped by a quick service location for an oil change instead of going to the dealership. This is my first oil change since I got my vehicle. I got the oil change on Monday, and now today (Wednesday) my car was shaking in park. I thought that was a weird coincidence after just getting my oil changed. I checked the dip stick and my oil was grossly overfilled. I went back to the location and explained the situation. After looking, the asst manager explained that the old oil was never drained, and that new oil was put in. So I drove 59 miles with double the amount of oil. Some new, some old. They emptied it, refilled it and assured me that since it was only driven for 2 days that no permanent damage would be done in that time. And offered me a free oil change. WHAT!?! He said that he could not give me a refund without manager approval and that a manager should be calling tomorrow. Help! Any experience with such an oversight!?image3024×4032 2.31 MBNo, you don’t want a refund or a free oil change. You want this documented in writing so when you have some engine issues, they can pay up the bill. Is the car driving fine?
Others will chime in, but maybe they have to pay for the dealer to do a spark plug inspection along with other stuff to make sure no damage done.
Most of us here, will tell you to steer away from quick lube places. If you are under warranty, then change the oil at the dealership. After that, find a good shop.
I DIY all the stuff, but keep the receipts and understand the dealer would deny warranty if I screw up.Better than no oil.  Back in college my to be wife did that to her 61 Plymouth that her dad got her to use.  He said to make sure to keep the oil filled, which she did.  Up to the top.  Smoked like crazy on the 90 mile trip home where the excess oil was drained out.  No harm no foul, for that one at least.This is the kind of thing that happens when you go to quickie lube joints. Many of us here would not let them wash our windows let alone change the oil… and your experience is why.
Agree with @galant… get this screwup in writing so that IF there is any long term damage, the quickie lube shop can be sued to pay for the repairs. And you will have to sue them. Throw that free oil change coupon in the trash and never go back.


 Mustangman:

… coupled with a LOT of similar reports over the years in this forum.
As one of our now-departed members, Joseph Meehan, used to say…
Never go to a quick-lube place.  Not even for directions!You should have written ‘“Mechanic” forgot’ instead. Friends don’t let friends use Kwik-E LubeHaha believe me I have definitely learned my lesson!Remove filter. Forget to drain oil? Hmm, I’m changed filter, what else am I supposed to do under the car?You are very lucky the engine did not hydrolock. That means oil is forced into the combustion chambers and since that liquid cannot be compressed it will bring the engine to a sudden stop. In most cases no damage is done but it is possibly for connecting rods to get bent.
As mentioned, better too much than none at all with the latter being the more common error.Thanks everyone
I have in writing what happened. I actually didn’t even have to ask-It was typed in the comment section of the receipt I was given yesterday. I got a refund for the oil change, threw away the free card I was given, and I’m taking it to a dealership before I leave town tomorrow just to double check before driving hundreds of miles!
And I will never make that mistake ever again!20 years ago a Dodge/Mitsubishi coupe came in with a complaint of lack of power. I road tested the car, performed like it was pulling a heavy trailer.
Since this car was in earlier in the day for an oil change the first thing I checked was the oil level, 4 inches over filled. I drained and filled the engine oil and road tested, performance normal.
There was no law suit, the lube techs were not fired and business resumed as normal at the dealership.
Quick lube shops collectively perform thousands of oil changes each day, once a month someone comes to Car Talk with a quick lube complaint, seems the odds of experiencing a problem is very low.A mistake happened, for an oil change place be it a quickie lube or indie shop mistakes do happen. Sorry you were in the small percentage that it happened to. I hope there is no issue with your engine.

We have a lot of wisdom to offer here at CarTalk, aren’t we?
“never go to quick-E-lube, friends don’t let friends do that”
“every used Subaru is a ticking bomb, buy anything but…”
“reliability has nothing to do with a name-plate, just have your used car purchase inspected and you gonna be fine”I agree with Nevada on this. Considering the relative inexperience of younger lube techs and the vast number of oil changes they perform each year while under pressure their mistake percentage has to be very low.
There’s only 2 fast lubes in my area. Both have been around about 30 years or so and I’ve only heard one complaint about one of them. Even that complaint was debatable.
If a fast lube is botching jobs 2 or 3 times a week then yes there’s a huge problem with that facility.It should be routine to check the oil level after changing oil, so there were TWO mistakes made. Not only was the crankcase overfilled, but the level wasn’t checked. I could forgive one mistake, but TWO is an indication of carelessness.It seems to me a well run shop that has very young mechanics where this might be their first job would have a foreman that checks their work before releasing the cars. The JL I used to use did just that. That formula might be why the owner had three or four shops in the area.


 fjwilsonjr_153222:

It should be routine to check the oil level after changing oil,


I do not know that as a standard. We had oil changes done at the dealer every 5k miles. At 16k I decided to check the oil. The dipstick would not pull out. Took it in and it ended up the dipstick had rusted to the tube, no charge of course. Oil level was fine, but leads me to believe they do not check oil level via dipstick after a change. They removed the tube, greased and cleaned and said it was probably due to condensation from short trips. Still working good.One could run a fast lube with the most competent, well experienced mechanics on Earth and odds are something is going to go wrong at some point if the pace is fast enough and/or there are too many distractions while the job is being performed.
Imagine if an Airbus captain with 25,000 flight hours was being interrupted  on the flight deck every few minutes while on a Transatlantic flight. The odds of going swimming go way, way up and more than one plane has gone down due to distractions.

On the way back from Florida once I sat next to a pilot dead-heading.  When we landed I asked him who did it, the computer or the pilot and he said both.  The pilot may bet distracted but the computer compensates so you stay dry-most of the time.The concern is, ironically, oil starvation. Overfilling the crankcase causes the piston motion to whip the oil into a froth, which can’t be pumped. Maybe you’re fine with using it a short time, but the long term concern is wear associated with loss of lubrication (bearings, even piston rings/bore).",,,,

Yikes!  550,000 pickups without pollution abatement?  That’s very unsettling. My guess is that fleet diesels are not modified this way, meaning that privately owned pickups are frequently modified. I only read the executive summary before this post. I wonder how many diesel pickups were sold in the decade.I think their numbers for PA are low. My county is highlighted as one of the non-adherent counties due to people modifying their diesels, and based on what I’ve seen driving around here for years, I’ll bet the non-compliance number is easily 12-15%+Same comments as @pyrolord314 for Florida. Seems the 15% rate is low for my area and way low for the center part of the state with a greater concentration of diesel pickups… or “Clewiston Cadillacs” as I like to call them. $75,000 lifted trucks rolling coal.
There is a very simple solution to this situation… put enforcement on the roads since you can SEE the trucks that “roll coal.” Plea bargain the fines for the truck owner to identify the shops that installed the device, if it wasn’t a DIY job, and prosecute the shop for EPA violations. The problem will solve itself pretty quickly with healthy fines for the guilty. Problem solved.
What will more likely happen, because we are ALL polluter-criminals until proven innocent, the EPA will force each state to emissions inspect every car and truck every year or 2. Those with only tunes, will revert to the factory tune with a 5 minute download, get a green sticker and reinstall the rolling coal tune when they get home. Pollution continues.
Those that removed the other pollution control hardware will be scrambling around the junkyards paying big bucks buying replacements for the emission control devices they removed. Or they will sell those polluting trucks to the economically disadvantaged who will be given an “economic hardship waiver” from compliance and the polluting will continue.
How do I know the second scenario will happen? Because it is EXACTLY what happened in certain counties in the state of Ohio in the 1980’s. It was cancelled after a decade or so because it was completely ineffective.I had always assumed that the advantage of owning a diesel-powered pickup was towing capability, and this is the only reason why diesel engines are even offered.  However, many of the diesel-powered trucks I see (other than ones used as work trucks and registered with commercial plates) have modifications which make them completely unsuitable for their intended use, such as a high lift kit, huge alloy wheels, etc.  Even among the privately-owned diesel pickups which are not visibly modified, most are crew-cab models with a super-tiny bed, not very useful for carrying stuff.
And of course, when I see a diesel truck drive by, and release a huge cloud of black soot, more than 9 times out of 10, the truck has a high lift kit, huge alloy wheels, and other silly modifications which make the truck useless for anything other than showing off.

You think people are practical?  Diesel used to be cheaper than gasoline, diesel engines more efficient (perhaps they still are).  A friend bought a diesel Rabbit in the '70s.

That’s what lifted trucks, loud exhausts and so forth are all aboutJust being a jerk!People have been modifying diesel pickup trucks for 30 years. There are probably 5 times more modified diesels on the road than what is spotted by stereotypical observations.Yep, if I had daughters I would tell them the same thing!It would be helpful if the report had some context.  How much does does one of these egr deleted/coal-rolling trucks pollute vs. an 18 wheeler?  If they both pollute similar amounts then, is it really a problem to get all worked over, given that that there are many more Kensworths running around than diesel pickups with the emission controls defeated.

When the coal-rolling brodozer delivers 80,000 pounds of goods in one trip, I’ll take your point, but only from a narrow environmental standpoint, and only insofar as it’s an indicator that we need to clean up the semis too. From a public welfare standpoint, you’re wrong regardless.
These reprobates are rolling coal to blanket people they want to bully with soot. I don’t like bullies. I think bullies should be dealt with harshly, whether it’s the middle school delinquent beating up the nerd or the 25-year-old jackass harassing people who choose lower-pollution modes of transport.

The Tesla Semi is expected to rollout next year. Tesla has a hard time keeping their rollout  dates, but it’s on the way. And Tesla is not the only one working on an all electric Semi.The Tesla semi is interesting and seems like a really good choice for local/semi-regional use. I don’t see it replacing traditional diesel semis for over-the-road use due to the lack of support infrastructure across the country.  Also the battery life (not range) is question, I’m assuming it has very large, very dense, and very expensive battery packs. Due to the high mileage these trucks typically do, the lifespan of the battery pack is bound to degrade more quickly than typical electric car, and require frequent replacement, typical semis will be on the road for twenty years or so before they get replaced. So I wonder what the cost of the replacement battery packs would be and whether or not, it’s financially better in the long run than diesel. I would think that with the continual improvement of electric vehicle batteries that the Tesla semi would be at least somewhat cheaper to keep on the road overall.I don’t remember the last time I saw a semi putting out visible smoke.  So these jerks are polluting more, and providing zero economic benefit, too.

I agree with that for NOW. But as I’ve said many many times in this forum…this technology is still very new and changing constantly. There are at least 5 different new battery concept startups in the Boston area that I know of. And as more and more electric semi’s on the road then you’ll see more charging stations. 5 years ago I could count on 1 hand the number of charging stations between my town in NH and Boston. I now know of 5 charging stations within 10 miles of my house. The infrastructure is growing rapidly.
Also the vast majority of Semi use is local. Just making local deliveries.",,,,

If you are not willing to spend one red cent to save a good running, good shape Honda accord your options are junk or Craigslist as others have said. No one is going to pay you good money for a non running 19 year old car with a salvage title.
Why would you expect other people to spend money to find out what is wrong with your car if you won’t.  They will assume you know the car is not worth fixing.I think you should at least pay for a shop to diagnose the problem so that you’re making an informed decision here.

If the engine has lost fuel pressure, the key dance will get it back up so the engine can start and run.Thanks… I think I’ll at least find out what’s wrong. It isn’t my primary vehicle, been keeping it as an emergency vehicle since I don’t have rental coverage on my 17 Sorrento.Yeah ,…maybe you’re right. Thanks.

Yes, serious. Think outside the box.
Back in the 1980s I worked in a shop repairing and calibrating electronic test equipment.
There was an old Army tech guy when certain pieces of gear came in he’d know what failed without even turning it on.Okay,… I will give it try first thing in the a.m., i’ll let you know what happens. Fingers crossed.You know that rental car coverage is much, much cheaper than registering and insuring a second car. Fix the Accord if it is cheap enough and sell it.Thanks… I really appreciate the advice. I’ll let you know what the ACCORD repair cost… and if reasonable I will try and sell it.Yeah, bad fuel pump relays are VERY common with older Hondas.  I might just replace it with a new one to avoid the trip to a mechanic. They’re $28-$42 at Rockauto, you might check local sources.
Here’s an assortment of prior posts about it:

120,Audi Q7 2007 timing belt,Maintenance/Repairs,18,490,"My car starting misfiring so I did a diagnostic on it.  It threw out a handful of codes.  Long story short, KISS-kept it simple and replaced the spark plugs and coil packs…same codes still came up.` Did a smoke test and clearly saw a leak coming up from one of the tubes (couldnt tell exactly where without climbing up onto the engine.  Talked to a local foreign car mechanic (30 years in biz) and after telling him the symptoms, fixes and the current codes…hes saying its the timing belt and to just quit it. Donate it or let it run until it doesnt.    Is this really a thing?   Ive always traded cars in and last one we gave to our Son (Yukon new in 2002).  Is this jiust the way of foreign cars?

Not sure why you think that and you need someone to actually look at this vehicle . If the timing belt broke it would not run . I really don’t have much faith in that mechanic if he really said to run it till it quits . It is not going to quit in your driveway but more likely to quit in front of a large truck .27 hours of labor to replace the timing chain on the 4.2 liter engine plus up to $1,000 in parts. Is it worth this much to you?Is this the v6 or v8?
I’d take it to a good German car mechanic, have it actually diagnosed, fix the known problem.Belt isnt broken…yet. And yes, ive had a belt break on me as I was going onto the freeway in my honda CRX. Im aware of that danger 1st hand. He was very knowledgeable and surprisingly talk done through the codes, etc… Clearly could’ve collected dough and had me bring it in for another diagnostic (as all mechanics like their own done).

It doesn’t have a belt, it has a timing chain.  If that’s going bad, you’re in for $$$.  But get it checked.

Is it a timing belt or a timing chain?Exactly. 2007…worth less then the fix but when do you stop paying for diagnostics and chasing the dragon. Its a bummer.








Nevada_545December 9






27 hours of labor to replace the timing chain on the 4.2 liter engine plus up to $1,000 in parts. Is it worth this much to you?It’s a V6.


 kregerkj_172858:

hes saying its the timing belt and to just quit it


You don’t have a timing belt, you have a timing chain (chains, actually) whether you have the V8 or the V6 (you don’t say). If this is the V6, the timing chain is on the BACK of the engine so it must come out to be repaired. Not sure about the V8.
I think that is where the 27 hours labor and $1000 in parts @Nevada_545 posted comes from.  Sooo figure $4500 or so to repair.
But I’d get a second opinion on that diagnosis ESPECIALLY if that 30 year local foreign car mechanic actually used the words “timing belt” when your car clearly has a timing chain in either engine.


 kregerkj_172858:

Is this jiust the way of foreign cars?


You ask that question and in another post you say you want to buy a used Mercedes 430 as a first vehicle for your son .   Any chance of posting those diagnostic codes you referred to? You mention a tube leaking during a smoke test. Any air leak at all can cause rough running as air is bypassing the MAF sensor.
And no, this is not the way of foreign cars. Mention is made of a timing chain in the rear of the engine. Well, the late mode 4.0 Ford for example also has a timing chain in the back of the engine.
You might need to a find another 30 years in the business mechanic. The one you talked to was wrong about the timing belt and if he actually told you to drive it until it quits…wow. What if it quits while trying to cross the railroad tracks with a 100 car freight train coming or with a Kenworth 2 cars back at highway speeds?
And where is this 30 years mechanic on the smoke test issue? A number of questions I know…I’m
Sure he said chain. But I know everyone knows what I’m referring too. 2nd opinion in the works…
Kelly Patterson 
253-468-0513No they don’t know what you are referring to because they are two different things .
Also not really a good idea to have your name and phone number on an unsecured open web site.I asked him if people actually throw these away once the timing chain needs to be replaced and he said that people drive them until they die or donate them.     He didn’t actually tell me to drive it until it stops.    People are very hardcore in this site.  I feel like it’s the “Nextdoor” app. 
I’ll list the codes but I’ve already researched them all and I can go $100’s into fixing all just to still need chain replaced.Yes. Like I mentioned in another post, I can spend $5k on a car that’s reading no codes with less Miles that I can drive until he’s 16 (hoping the Ford bronco gets here by summer) and easier to work on or spend $4k+ on my car with higher miles needing tires + as well. I was going to give him this Audi next July.

121,Oil Life Calculation,General Discussion,20,688,"I saw this post on the Reddit labeled version of Cartalk. The post;
Engineer here for a major automotive company. An older colleague passed along this oil life rule of thumb before he retired. It’s too good not to share. He had reviewed over his career probably thousands of sets of oil analysis data, and this RoT is based on that.
Oil life in miles = 50 * (Engine oil capacity in qts.) *  average mpg over the period
So for my Mustang that is 50 * 8 quarts * 19 mpg = 7600 miles
My truck would be    50 * 6qts * 13mpg = 3900 miles
This formula accounts for the highway driver or short trip driver. Highway mpgs are higher so oil life would be longer, the short tripper would have much lower mpgs so the oil life would be shorter. Supposedly the formula is based on acid buildup in the oil so it doesn’t matter if this is synthetic, a blend or conventional oil.
The oil minder on the Chevy seems to trigger much later if driven lots of highway miles but only a little later for short trips. The Mustang is an anomaly as it gets the oil changed early because it gets tracked.Hellcat 50x7 qts = 350x 7mpg = 2450 miles.
Rear tires = 2500 mi.So my Focus would be 50 * 4.5 * 32= 7,200 (although I’ll stick with 5k)
my Odyssey would be 50 * 5 * 21= 5,250, which is about right with the OLM
That’s an interesting formulaThat’s a very interesting formula. Actually makes a lot of sense. …I like it a lot.
Only problem I have with  it…most people can’t do simple math. 


 MikeInNH:

most people can’t do simple math


Agree! Most people can’t understand “5000 miles OR 12 months, whichever come first” either.  It won’t work for hybrids, but otherwise, it can be a good rule of thumb.


 jtsanders:

It won’t work for hybrids


Plug-in Hybrid…sure. But why not regular hybrid? Change interval will be a farther out, but the engine isn’t working as hard as regular ICE engine…so I think it could still be validIMO, the constant should be different to account for the electric assist. For early non PHEV hybrids it was probably still a good estimate, but as electric assist intervals expand, the constant 50 becomes less viable. In any case, I won’t substitute the equation for the OLM. Since it takes operating conditions into account, I’ll go with that.


 Mustangman:

Most people can’t understand “5000 miles OR 12 months, whichever come first” either.


+1
Based on a lot of questions in this forum over the years, it seems that adults (who probably hold responsible jobs and who most likely have the right to vote), are frequently unable to understand that… extremely tricky … phrase, “whichever comes first”.
My oldest friend, from my undergraduate years, believed that because he only drives about 900 miles per year, he could wait about 7 or 8 years before changing his oil.   Only after a LOT of prodding (and explaining the “whichever comes first” proviso repeatedly ) did he finally get the first oil change for his Scion, after ~4 years.   IIRC, he has now had the oil changed twice in the 7 years that he has owned the car.
And, even though he is the cheapest person I have ever known, all of his oil changes for the first three years would have been free, if he had availed himself of them.  Go figure…One way to look at it is that a quart of oil can protect an engine while it burns 50 gallons of gas.
A 5 qt sump is good for 250 gallons of gas.That formula doesn’t work for turbo engines.  My 2018 Mazda 6 calculation would suggest a 7,500 mile OCI, but the factory interval for the turbo is 5,000 miles.  With a turbo operating at high temperature, I would not chance extending the OCI.  My older Mazda 6 (normally aspirated) easily goes to 7,500 miles between oil changes and is currently at 175,000 miles without any oil burning.Simply based on this formula my mom’s 2010 Prius would be good for about 11,000 miles between changes, The 6,000-7,000mi intervals she’s doing now are worth the $55 annual oil change and service with the independent shop. Been following these guy’s lead since 1993 without issues.Who said the formula applies perfectly to every possible case?
It’s just an interesting way to look at things.
It’s clear who on this forum I would or would not want at a brainstorming session.


 jtsanders:

For early non PHEV hybrids it was probably still a good estimate, but as electric assist intervals expand,


But if t he electric range is pushed out then the gas mileage will increase…and thus push the number higher. I still think it’ll be close. Plug-in hybrids are going to be different tough.



 bloody_knuckles:

That formula doesn’t work for turbo engines.


Good point. So maybe adjust formula - 25 * (Engine oil capacity in qts.) * average mpg over the period
I still like the Formula and the way it looks at oil change interval.My turbo Audi has a 10k oil change interval. By the formula, it should be changed at 7500 miles. So it is on the other side of Mazda’s 5k interval.
I wouldn’t go 10k on a change interval on any car let alone a turbo. Better to err on the side of caution.Besides engine type (turbo, hybrid etc.) some engines just run dirtier or cleaner than others, mainly due to ring seal and blowby, and would benefit from more or less attention than any one-size-fits-all protocol.
And that’s whether we’re talking a formula like above, operating hours, or mileage.


 Mustangman:

Better to err on the side of caution.


I go with the car manufacturer’s recommended interval, and try to do it between 15% to 20% life remaining. They spent a lot of money figuring that out, and I’m willing to believe they want return customers.Nothing against the calculations but I do it the easy way.  Every 5000 miles.  Not much math involved.  The extra cost is deducted from the inheritance to be passed on.I have a 2020 Ford F-150 with the 5.0 V8 and I had its first oil change done at 9,140 miles and the oil life monitor was at 12%. The oil looked dirty but not black. Also the maintenance schedule is 10k between oil changes OR  when the oil change light comes on. So I would take the oil life monitor with a grain of salt. It is a rule of thumb, after all.
The 5.0 Ford has an 8 quart oil pan in trucks or cars. Doesn’t take much of an increase in mpgs to hit 10k changes. 8 qts × 50 × 25 mpg = 10,000
That is a only a bit more than my Mustang can get for highway mpgs",,,,

Last week Hyundai added another 129,000 vehicles to the engine recall list. It seems that my timing belts last twice as long as Hyundai engines.I think you posted to the wrong thread Mr. Nevada .


 VOLVO-V70:

I think you posted to the wrong thread


In the past you have recommended that vehicle owners have their oil changed at dealers during the warranty period to maintain a no doubt record of maintenance. Should a vehicle with a high engine failure rate be serviced by any slop in Fairbanks Alaska?
I believe that those who own these troubled vehicles should maintain a relationship with a dealer.Are 2015 also prone to trouble?
“The problem became so widespread that Kia issued a recall on all 2011 through 2014 model Optima sedans.”Yes, most mechanics are unreasonable.
It reminds me of the guy asked a friend to recommend a contractor. He said, I want one that is good, fast and cheap. His friend saidm he doesn’t exist. Pick 2 out of the three.OP – You asked a reasonable beginner’s question.  It’s admirable that you want to know how to take care of your car without going to the dealer for everything, but your question is too broad (general maintenance or a specific problem?).  Unfortunately, some of the replies seem to range from humorous to off-topic.  The people here are usually more helpful than that; maybe they are under some strain.
In general:
Be more specific – do you need routine maintenance (e.g., oil changes) or do you have a specific problem (car barely runs, and smoke filling passenger compartment; WiFi won’t stay connected)?
Ask friends, neighbors and colleagues.  Who do they use?  What kind of service have they had done?  Were the repairs done efficiently (good diagnosis, not just guess-and-replace)?
Use the various internet reviews mentioned above, and the Mechanics Files on this site (if you can find them), but realize that internet reviews might be biased (even self-posted) and outdated.
Be willing to try one and move on if not satisfied.
Regarding “reasonable” – First, realize that mechanics need to make a living.  Modern cars are complicated; besides the 100-year old mechanical technology, the 75-year-old electrical technology, and the 50-year-old electronic technology, cars now are loaded with computer technology.  Mechanics need a LOT of training (or experience) and TONS of tools and diagnostic equipment, the shop facility costs money to buy/rent and maintain, and somebody has to up-front the capital to stock parts so you don’t need to wait three weeks for brake pads.  The customer has to expect to pay for that.  Consider how much the service is worth to you; MAYBE try to do some price comparisons.  Somewhat aside, often enough I see (on neighborhood forums) people seeking reasonable plumbers, appliance repair, electricians, gardeners, whatever; I do not see inquiries about “reasonable” neurosurgeons, wealth managers, personal injury attorneys, whatever.
Second, realize that some dealers are “reasonable” and reliable (and that some independent mechanics’ skills and ethics might not be as good as you want).
Third, the experts here generally warn away from quick-lube and chain-brand repair shops, UNLESS you learn of one that is reliable or you already know enough to check their work before you drive away (did they put in oil? did they drain the old oil first? are the brakes working properly?)
Fourth, realize that even with competent, honest mechanics some problems are hard to solve or require multiple fixes, and even good people sometimes make mistakes (but are willing to correct them).
And a piece of general advice – Cars are expensive and complicated.  You have to expect to spend money to maintain them.  The better you maintain them (READ THE OWNERS MANUAL!), and the better you treat them when you drive, the less you will have to spend on expensive repairs.
So, be more specific about what you need, and use your available information resources wisely.  Effort and patience will be rewarded.  Good luck.",,,,

It’s just me and my mom we don’t have any family to take us anywhere. We have a 1993 grand marquis , Back in march our car battery died, we called AAA and they put in a new one. About 2 months latter it failed so they came out and replaced it. Anyway today the car wouldn’t start so i called our neighbor he jumped  the battery for us. I asked him if it could be the alternator? He said drive the car around the block so the alternator can charge up the battery then come home and turn the car off and then start it again, if it starts the alternator charged the battery and it’s not the alternator it’s  the battery. If the car doesn’t start again then it’s the alternator because the  alternator didn’t charge the  battery. So i plan on getting another battery, any advise would be much appreciated


 Solved by circuitsmith in post #116 


                14.x volts right away means your alternator and charging system is likely okay and doing its job.

Since you don’t wish to divulge any information about the vehicle you’re referring to, the generic answer would be, take the vehicle to a parts store that will test the battery/charging system for free.
Then you’ll know.
Testermy bad, I’m a little stressed  I forgot to mention the make, it’s a 1993 grand marquisDriving around the block will not charge the battery, you need to take a 20 minute drive to put some juice back.  As @Tester says go to a parts store, Advance, Autozone etc, most will check the battery for free.   Make that part of your 20 minute drive


 drivetime:

He said drive the car around the block so the alternator can charge up the battery then come home and turn the car off


Are you going to drive around the block for 4 hours? Recharge the battery with a battery charger.
Since you only drive this car 20 miles a month you will need to maintain the battery, the charging system won’t recharge the battery any significant amount during short trips.no not for 4 hours he was just telling me how to check if it’s the alternator we are going to try to have AAA come out tomorrow to check the battery and replace it if needed but we couldn’t get ahold of them today because I’m in Florida and we just had a storm with caused a lot of flooding so they are very busy.


 drivetime:

no not for 4 hours he was just telling me how to check if it’s the alternator


He was wrong, look at the size of that battery, it can not be recharged in 3 minutes. As I recall your battery has been replaced twice this year, it is unlikely that you have damaged it, it should be rechargeable.Maybe I’m missing something, but it seems as if you keep coming back to simply replacing the battery.   Have you determined that the alternator is indeed putting out sufficient voltage to keep the battery charged?  If the alternator is faulty it won’t matter how many new batteries you install; they’ll all fail.  Other suggestions about using a plug-in battery charger are on target, but if you need a new alternator those are all stop gap measures that won’t solve the underlying problem.I suggest you invest ~$20 in a digital voltmeter.
With the engine idling and headlights on, measure the battery DC voltage.
It should be 13.5 to 14.5V. If it’s lower there’s a problem with the alternator or other part of the charging system.
Next measure the AC voltage, engine idling. Should be less than 0.5V.
If more, the alternator has one or more bad rectifiers.
Once a battery is too low to start an engine it takes at least 6 hours to fully charge and make it healthy and happy.
There’s no shortcut to a full charge.
Driving around the block, or 20 minutes won’t cut it.Unless I missed it, you might define “no start”. That could mean…
Starter motor cranks the engine but it will not run.
Starter motor is inoperative and does not crank the engine at all.
If the latter, that could point to a faulty neutral safety switch; sometimes referred to as a range selector switch. At 27 years of age a faulty neutral switch would not be a surprise; assuming the symptom matches the latter.
Sounds like you need to ignore mechanical advice from both AAA and your neighbor.


 SteveCBT:

Driving around the block will not charge the battery


And it will also not drain a brand new battery enough to make the car not start if the alternator isn’t working.
I concur with @Nevada_545. You need a maintenance charger. You can get 'em for around 50 bucks at battery stores.If it were my car I would confirm all connections to and from the battery are good, confirm that the battery and alternator are functioning properly by testing. Check for parasitic draw. If all is good. Then use a battery maintainer if the car is seldom used or used for short distances only.Hi again everyone, i had a horrible day fighting with AAA to long of a story to tell.

Thank you


 drivetime:

i had a horrible day fighting with AAA to long of a story to tell.


Let me guess, you asked for a warranty replacement but they told you the battery is good, only needs to be recharged.
Harbor Freight sells inexpensive battery chargers. I believe a 10 amp/2 amp automatic battery charger is $40.No it wasn’t that, they refused to come out because we asked them to not send out the guy that came out last time with out a mask on and he seemed to not know what he was doing so the company that AAA uses said they would not come out because of our complaint, they said they would try to get another contacted company but it’s  out of our area and they were very busy. Do i have to disconnect the battery to charge it?The cars cables can remain connected to the battery while charging the battery.Yeah maybe it’s one of those things  but the funny thing is our neighbor is having the same problem with a battery he bought from AAA but just in case maybe we should use the car more but in the past we have used the car for short trips and never had a problem so i guess we will have to go to the  mechanic shop and let him check but that is a blind itemYou seem to be thinking that your are at the mercy of specialists, but something like this is well within the scope of something you can check yourself.  A digital voltmeter can be had for about $20 or less.  And something like this battery charger can also serve your needs at a very modest price.  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07W6B987F/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 3

You didn’t leave it out.  A little hidden but still there.  You may be getting bum batteries but I think the lack of driving is most of it.  In the past 6 months I have usually charged up the battery on the car that just sits about every month.  You can get a charger at Walmart, farm store, auto store and they aren’t that expensive.  You could use a maintainer too that you would just leave plugged in all the time to keep it fully charged.  It won’t have the output like a charger though but keeps it full.  The other thing is you can buy a jump pack at any of the auto stores for a little over $100.  That can be used to jump the battery if it is dead.  It’s all stuff that you should probably have anyway to make sure you are not stuck at home.
A little word of caution on AAA though, at least the way it was 50 years ago in Minnesota.  They (one guy in charge of ERS) didn’t like any more than three calls on the same problem and would cancel their membership.  That meant that their auto insurance was canceled too. People would just get hopping mad but he figured that was enough chance to get the car fixed.  The sales staff would beat on him but he canceled people anyway.  I can still see him perched in his office with his red pen.  Every club is different though.  When I left them, I went with AMOCO and never had a problem.I have a 1982 Ford Granada that had a similar problem. Its battery died while sitting in my garage. I couldn’t figure out what drained it. I had AAA jump start the car for me. With a multimeter, I determined there was something draining it. As it turned out, I had something in the trunk of the car that pressed against the trunk light switch causing it to stay on.",,,,
124,2003 Mercedes CLK 430 problems,Maintenance/Repairs,23,6.9k,"My mom just picked up a CLK 430. I drove it around for a bit and noticed that a few things didn’t seem quite right


The transmission seems to start out in 2nd gear rather than first even when the transmission is not in “winter” mode. The transmission is also very hesitant to downshift, and often times will not downshift at all if the car is moving.


There’s a noticeable amount of lag time between when you stand on the gas and when car actually starts accelerating.


The engine doesn’t seem to rev very quickly or freely, and there is some noticeable pinging when the engine is under load. Performance was very tepid for a 275 HP car.


The spark plugs and ignition wires were replaced last week. The car has 105k miles on it. I know the previous owner used regular unleaded, and the owners specifically states that 91 octane should be used and goes as far as to mention precautions that should be taken should regular unleaded. The car was filled up with 93 octane fuel earlier today.
Just 15 minutes ago, I took my stepdad out in the car to demonstrate my findings. On the first drive (about 5-10 minutes) the car acted like it did when I had driven it earlier in the day (not downshifting, hesitating, lack of power, etc.), and the check engine light came on. He wanted to drive the car to see for himself. So we pulled over, shut off the engine and switched seats. He got behind the wheel, started the car, the check engine light is still on. But the car ran perfectly. It was starting out from 1st gear and would downshift promptly when give full throttle. Performance was immensely improved. The check engine light is still on though. The car has a 1 year bumper to bumper warranty. So I guess they can bring it in to have it looked at.
I’m just sort of at a loss as to why the car performed so poorly when I drove it, and all of a sudden performed correctly, after the engine was restarted. Anybody have any ideas about what happened?At least you’ve got the CEL to start with.  I’m no Mercedes expert, but I’ve often heard of their sloooow throttle response and 2nd gear starts.  But the CEL points to a problem somewhere…I read a lot on the internet, and looking at the problem my first question is does winter mode influence downshifting, In my mind that would be a good idea to not have downshifting occurring on wintery roads. The most common issue seemed to be a software upgrade. One note I saw was to never change the mode unless you are in park. Then there were a plethora of minor fixes to varied to be off much help. Does the Bumper to Bumper include software upgrades?Could it be a holdover from the 87 octane gasoline?  If the car has to change timing to accommodate high test, this could take a little time.  The CEL won’t go out for a few drive cycles, as you know.  Since this is a cheap fix, I’ll hope for it to work.  Maybe Mom can drive ti around for a few days to see if the change for the better is permanent.@FoDaddy I worked at a Benz dealer for many years.  Your transmission will start off in 2nd gear, unless you force the downshift.  That is the way they’re programmed to operate.
Please post the fault codes.
The 113 engine (your V8 was well known for having faulty MAF sensors.  This would usually result in fault codes.  Some people swore by cleaning them, but I always felt more comfortable replacing the part.
Did you put in the OEM plugs.  Those 113 engines often didn’t like the ""wrong’ plug.


RM European Auto Parts LLC 1



Spark Plug 1
This brand is a resistor style plug.





I suggest you bring the car to a shop with a scanner that will retrieve all the Mercedes-Benz data and codes, not just the generic OBD 2 data.  There are many functional tests and PIDs that many of the aftermarket scanners just won’t do.  I have a Snap-On scanner, and the european software package is a joke.
Also, while you’re at that shop, have them look at the transmission adaptation data.  Make sure the adaptations aren’t maxed out.  The adaptation data will give the mechanics an excellent idea of the condition of the transmission.
Has the transmission fluid and filter ever been serviced?  Only use the factory ATF.  I recommend against a flush.

DO NOT use that generic multi-purpose one-size-fits-all ATF.
@barkydog the w/s switch does influence the shifting.  It doesn’t make a huge difference one way or the other.
Did you put in the correct Bosch ignition wires.  Again, sometimes the engine doesn’t like the “wrong” wires.

I’ve seen cars that actually had slight misfires BECAUSE of installing these.@db4690
I don’t know what plugs or ignition wires were used, I didn’t do the work, nor had any input on the matter.
I spoke with my stepdad a few minutes ago, and he said he turned the engine on and off about 5 times, and now the check engine light has gone out. However he didn’t drive it. I’ll see if I can swing by their place tomorrow after work and take the car out and see if I replicate the initial problems I experienced earlier today.  Someone on another forum mention that the  ring gear adaptation limit might also have been met and the ECU may be retarding the ignition timing. Any thoughts on that?  I wouldn’t think it would effect the transmission, but it might explain why the engine seemed to be down on power.
That’s for your input, I’ll try to see what specific type of plugs and ignition wires were used. I don’t know the service history on the transmission though.Sounds like a (not cheap) trip to a good MB tech is in order.  Comes with the territory, unfortunately.Sorry I’m a bit late on the update, but I didn’t get  chance to drive the car again until today. I took the car out for 10 minute drive today, and it drove perfectly, Plenty of power and prompt downshifts. I did note some slight rattling from the engine at idle when observing the car from the outside, but inside the car you can’t hear it.
The ignition wires are apparently OEM from the MB parts counter, and the plugs are OEM Bosch as well.2nd gear starts? Sounds like my Chevy power glide trans. I could not spin my posi rear end impala even in snow. Never, ever got stuck in that car. And I thought newer cars came with 5, 6, 7 speed trans for improved acceleration and fuel economy?@Stoveguyy it has a 5-speed automatic transmission.
It is programmed to start in 2nd gear, unless the driver forces the downshift into 1st.Wow, those Mercedes engineers sure are clever. I can see a wimpy clk320 with 2nd gear econo starts. But this is the V8 model. How about a little pep? I bet the car even has a driver selectable shift mode for sport-Econ-snow mode? I wonder if trac control can be shut off so u can do a burnout?@Stoveguyy there is a w/s (winter/summer switch) and and ESP (electronic stability program) off switch.
I don’t know why you’d want to do burnouts in a 4 seat luxury convertible.  Those aren’t the kind of customers that bought those cars.“I don’t know why you’d want to do burnouts in a 4 seat luxury convertible. Those aren’t the kind of customers that bought those cars.”
Yeah, but then their kids get their hands on them.ha ha275 HP in a car that size isn;t going to scare any Aston Martins, but it does sound like the car is overdue for some TLC.
As regards the difference in performance, I suspect that originates in the difference in,shall we say… driving styles. But if it were mine I’d bring the car in and get it checked out. Oinging and CEL lights even under hard driving need to be looked at.@db4690, a neighbor owns a CLK500.  He used to drive it until he bought a new 750iL two years ago.  Now one of his kids drives the Benz.  And don’t forget his wife’s Escalade, his new Suburban, his F150 Harley Davidson, and whatever his kids are driving.  Must be nice to be him!@the same mountainbike
On Monday, my mom gave me a ride to go pick up my car that was getting a state inspection. I drove the car on the way to the shop doing the inspection, a journey of about 10 miles. Initially the car started and drove fine, there was no lack of power, and the transmission was shifting properly, about a mile from the shop we came to a red light and stopped, when the light turned green, I tried to accelerate, but the car balked momentarily, and then started accelerating quite slowly, gave the car full throttle to see if it would kick down to 1st gear, it did not downshift. when we reached the turn off to go the shop, again the car would accelerate like it had suddenly lost 150 HP, and the transmission again didn’t seem to want to downshift.  However the check engine light did not come on this time. I told my mother what was happening, and she noticed the problem as well when she was driving the car back home. However yesterday she said that the car drove perfectly on her way to work, and then back home again after work. I told her that she needs to take it in to a MB shop to see what’s going on. If and when she does I’ll report back with their findings.
I realize that 275 HP isn’t going to be Ferrari territory, but this thing was so down on power than I think a Bluebird with 50 kids aboard would’ve shown the Benz its taillights.@FoDaddy you might have a bad MAFThank you for an excellent feedback post.
Even though the CEL light is no longer on, it’s very possible that the computer has stored some fault codes that would suggest why the failures occurred. Db4690 might be right about the mass airflow sensor, however I’d expect a MAF failure to produce a more consistant symptomology.
Another possibility is a failing fuel pump. That can be tested for.
The transmission not shifting sounds to me to be a secondary effect of the intermittant power loss rather than a fault of its own. I think once you get the engine operation sorted out the tanny will work normally.
I’m looking forward to the shop’s finding.Im late to the game but researching the 430 and found this.  Wondering if it ever was figured out?   I read through a lot of it and to me it kept pointing to the EPS or ESP (cant recall)button…I bought one of these (2001 clk 430 Cab)at an auction to keep at my vacation home in Az and the first day I kept hitting that button because it was where I thought the window button should be.  It only reset if I turned off the car and restarted it.  Easy fix but it scared the crap out of me that I wasted dough.    Ive since sold it this last summer and now looking to buy another one here in Seattle for my sons first car (now that im familiar with them).  This time doing my due diligence.",,,,

Several years ago we were passing through Oklahoma City and needed to stop for gas. At one point my wife, who was driving in the left lane, complained, “By the time I see a gas station it’s too late to change lanes.” It didn’t occur to her 1. To go ahead and get in the right lane or 2. That there would probably be a gas station near pretty much any off ramp.There’s no indication that any exit exists until you see the sign where the ramp veers away from the parkway. Unless you know the exit is there, you will likely miss it no matter what lane you’re in.A city street on my route to work was reduced from 3 lanes to 1 last year, I took an alternate route. There must be a way to deal with a lane that ends and a closed lane.

Ownership summary. Just summed up what my experience with the Blazer has been.
Listed problems I have encountered and what actions I took. With it being an ‘86, it’s
getting harder and harder to find any replacement parts other than salvage yard. The
Ownership post reflected frustration in nagging problems that continue to pop up.
These problems tend to damper my enthusiasm about getting problems corrected.Your ownership post is on your profile so it may not be seen by many people .  Please start your own thread instead of tagging on to other threads about a different subject.
Frankly this vehicle is past it’s sell date anyway.I thought I did what Carolyn asked me to do. She said she would move the posts if I copy/paste the summary under new topic.
I realize the Blazer is past the sell date value wise. I thought the forum was to try to fix
problems regardless of age, not sell. I am retired and do have disposable income to
try and maintain pristine condition. My goal has been to keep it serviceable as long as I
can. I have already passed the point of exceeding it’s value spending more than it’s
worth in repairs.

126,Fan comes on even if car is off - Pontiac Grand Am,Maintenance/Repairs,3,225,"I recently bought my son his first car, a 1998 Pontiac Grand Am - got it from a small car lot and thought it would be a good “beater with a heater” for his first go around.
We recently pulled the car inside our garage since the temps dropped (about 2 weeks ago) and ever since then, I had been hearing a fan-like noise coming from the garage area, about every 30 minutes.
I went out there today and stood until I heard the noise again and sure enough, 30 minutes after hearing it earlier, it happened again and it WAS coming from his car, under the hood.  It almost sounds like someone turning on a leaf blower for about 5 seconds and shutting it back off.  Mind you, this car has only been driven twice since we bought it in September; on the way home and once around the block because he’s not able to drive yet.  He does go out and starts it once a week, but it has not moved since being brought home.
Why on earth would this car, which does not move and only is started once a week, be making this noise?  I can only guess it’s the engine fan popping on, but why?  It’s not turned on, the ignition is off, the AC/heat dials are all set to “off” but like clockwork, every 30 minutes this fan comes on.
I am not making extensive repairs to this vehicle, but I also don’t want it burning down my garage if it has a short!!
Any help you can provide, is most appreciated.
Thanks!Electric fans kick on when it senses the water temp is at a certain temperature or higher. I suspect it might be the temperature sensor is faulty. If the engine is hot (like right after a drive), then the fan will cycle on and off until the temps go down.Even if the car hasn’t ran in almost a week?  It’s been sitting for about 5 days since it was last started, and even then, we only left it running about 10 minutes.The powertrain control module controls the cooling fan relay.

The problem may be with the PCM.

So don’t you believe the mechanic? Did the mechanic put your Sport Trac on a lift to confirm, or drive it? Or just toss this diagnosis at you while chatting next to it in the parking lot?
If you just want a 2nd opinion, I’d say sure, could be either of those, could also be the diff but I haven’t heard it, or looked at it or touched it and that’s what is required to confirm.

Took my car in for a recall fix and oil change, got a text stating the following:
30k Service update for:
-Fluids and filters: $605
-Cabin filter clean: $80
-Throttle plate and injector cleaning: $250.
Is this all an upsell?
Edit: Thank you all so much for your valuable insight- saved me a lot of money!!Two suggestions:

Read the manual to see the maintenance schedule.
Get a different mechanic
Shame on Subaru. Here is a story 13 I think you may like. Maybe you can guess which brand the other one in the story is?I recently had my Forester serviced this way: I had the stealership change the oil for about $60. They screed that up, so I had them do it again. While there, I bought the official Subaru engine air filter for about $25. I then bought a cabin air filter on Amazon for $11. I changed the cabin air filter myself. I then took the engine air filter and car to my local mechanic. He did everything in the owner’s manual for $160. That included changing the brake fluid. He listed every  single thing he did on the receipt in case I have a problem and need to prove it was done. This work quoted by my local Subaru dealer is $500.  I guess the extra $300 is added profit.Changing transmission and other fluids at 30K is a good idea, but no need to pay the dealer.  As others suggested, check with an independent mechanic and possibly just do some of the work yourself.  Not all of what the dealer recommended may be necessary.  Air filters are generally easy to do once you figure out the routine for your particular car.Folks like to argue about oil change intervals, hybrids too, so, do you think a dealer really does change fluids like receipt says? Trans, diff, brake?The 30k miles service is considered a major service. That means various fluids and so on should be changed so it is not ripoff.
The cabin filter seems a bit high but that is a Subaru item so it will be higher in price and not all of that is the dealer’s fault.  (See my last paragraph)
As for the throttle plate and injector cleaning that can be a bit of a subjective gray area. Some cars may not need it at the 30k miles mark and others might need it.
For what it’s worth, I’ve worked for 3 Subaru dealers and all of those fluids got changed at the 30k miles service. As a matter of fact we always recommended a valve lash inspection also. Some say that is not needed but from experience I can tell you that I have never seen one that did not need the lash checked and adjusted. The default option there is to ignore it and hope that you are not part of the unlucky minority whose engine suffers a tight valve and head damage.
Regarding dealer prices and I have been through this more than once. Price a new automatic transmission from Subaru. Once your heart settles you will see why fluid changes are necessary. When I worked for Subaru the price of an automatic (the actual dealer cost) was right at 4 grand. With a 25% markup it’s now at 5 grand and 6 grand with labor, fluid, gaskets, etc. Expensive? Yes it is but not because of the dealer.Not sure which fluids are being changed.  But I would give odds that not all are manufacturer scheduled maintenance intervals.  I am basing this on the manufacturer scheduled fluid intervals on my 2014 suby.If the throttle plate and injector cleaning is not listed in the owner’s manual as a normal maintenance item, then it should be covered as a warranty item…if it really needs it.

If you have the Ecoboost there’s a possibility that you’re getting condensation inside of the intercooler. If that’s the case, it would only become noticeable on moderate to hard acceleration, it’s more common on the early models (11-12).  Also if you have an Ecoboost, you’re going to want to change the plugs more often than the manual suggests.  75k miles is about the max on set of spark plugs for the Ecoboost.The OP never posted back with any info. A shudder could be an engine going out,  vacuum leak, ignition miss, fuel injector problem, fuel pressure issue, motor or trans mount issue, torque converter, U-joints, wheel balance, brake problem, you name it.

132,Oil color question!,Maintenance/Repairs,38,2.0k,"Hi, I just have a quick question about oil color! I had this 2004 Camry Sportivo 2.4L for just over a month now, I drove almost 2k KM already, it had an oil change right before I bought it. The oil color is still not dark though even after a fair bit of driving, and am not sure if its a good thing or not. Most cars I had in the past would get dark oil color very quickly after an oil change and driving around for a bit. Should I be worried there might be a headgasket issue or its just a really clean engine? I kind of doubt that it is because its done over 288k KM overall. See the photo! Thanks!

With todays oils  and filters  most can go 6-7000 miles  or more  before having to be changed .Modern fuel injection cars, which includes your  16 Y.O. Camry, properly maintained generally have clean appearing oil until the next oil change.  My car has 128K miles on it, the oil is still  clear amber right up to my 5K oil change.  My V8 truck with 63K on it,  after a round trip drive from central Florida to north Georgia, still clear amber oil.
Old carburetor engines would look hazy black after a few thousand, or less, miles.Good that the trans fluid has been changed recently.

That’s a really nice looking car, by the way 
I live in southern California, and the climate is extremely brutal for the car’s exterior surfaces

I think the climate in New Zealand is a lot milder, versus the american southwest . . . ?!Thanks  Yeah make sense, I briefly been to Cali before it was really hot reminded me of northern Australia a bit, and it looks like you guys barely get any rain. So you probably get more sun damage but less rust? In New Zealand yeah the climate is more mild, specially where I am, it never gets really hot and never below 0c either (32F) but its very very windy and rains a lot haha! So we do have a problem with cars rusting when people don’t look after them, but yeah you still see a lot of cars from 90’s and early 2000’s on the roads driving around in fairly good condition.

You nailed it . . .
Leather seats and clear coat suffer terribly due to the sun
But the flip side is that we don’t have a big rust problem

Anyways, one of the guys at work has a red Toyota 4x4 truck that looks identical to the one in the movie, the one that the kid wrecked.  Except it doesn’t have any rust, unlike the one in the movieHaha yeah there is a car yard down the road from me they have a lot of old American cars they love to import, they all look in really good condition, was very temping to get one I do prefer American style cars over Jap but with our fuel prices here at around $2 per L just for 91 and higher maintenance cost I think ill stick to Toyota 
Nah I still haven’t seen it but yeah I’ve heard of that movie and been meaning to watch it, thanks for the reminder I’ll check it out! Wow, at about 4 liters/gallon that makes high octane at $2 / gallon look cheap!
But on the other hand considering how well you guys did with Covid, that you still have somewhere to drive to, I guess it seems to even it out though I miss my Cars and Coffees Saturday car meets!
So I’m wondering how do LHD US cars do on RHD NZ roads, especially with the stick on the “wrong” side?Yeah we did alright with Covid, had a full lockdown for a month in March but since then its mostly been back to normal, everything open and can go to events/gigs etc… But tbh its an Island with less then 5mil people, would have been embarrassing if we didn’t do well lol.
Sometimes people modify them and make them RHD but usually they don’t bother not worth the $, its a bit strange at first but its like anything you get used to it after awhile and its not a big deal anymore. With more modern American cars like for example newer Mustangs or F150 they often already RHD, I guess they make them for NZ/AU market at the factory.


 Krazykov:

Some of us on this forum live in CITIES that have more than 5 million inhabitants . . .“So, what does the oil dipstick look like?”
Look in your owner’s manual!    Get a manual if you need it, even an online pdf will help.
But paper one in glove compartment can be VERY useful.Ok firstly and this is pretty universal on all cars but particularly true to toyota your oil dipstick is always yellow and tranny dipstick is orange. It appears as though the engine has been replaced. If it has then you are running on a reconditioned motor and so it will act as though its brand new. . . Meaning its extra clean and can take  up to 3 months before you start to see soot(carbon) discoloration in the oil. In your other photo where you’re showing the oil on the dipstick you can see it is already showing slight discoloration in the oil on the stick. Also because you aren’t in the U.S. that motor is required to run on synthetic oil which resists carbon buildup in the engine case and in the oil so it may not discolor as it would when running petrol oil. In other words it appears to be just fine.Cheers, oh interesting theory, is there anyway to double check if its an original motor or its been replaced? In any case cant really complain the car still runs great considering its age and mileage, and I didn’t pay much for it. I do want to look after it though and I actually double checked with the dealership where I bought it if they changed the oil and nah they didn’t, there is no record when it was changed last or what oil they used. So I think ill definitely get that done next week, gonna get some Penrite 5W-30 full synthetic probably, that’s usually my go to, or 5W-40 one.photo_2020-11-12_21-50-23478×760 36.3 KB",,,,
133,Tried to Fix PT Cruiser Power Window Motor - Now Car Won’t Start,Maintenance/Repairs,9,365,"2006 PT Cruiser had faulty wiring on the driver’s side window. Went in and switched out the regulator/motor but found that previous owner must have done something inside the driver’s side door because the wires we needed to connect to the new harness were just spliced together and there was nothing to hook into the harness, just exposed wires heat-wrapped together. We tried to work around it by splicing the wires from the new motor to the existing wires. It worked, kind of, though turns out we had installed the part backwards.
The next thing I knew, the car wouldn’t start. Thinking we messed something up with the power window wiring, we disconnected the new motor. Didn’t help. I get clicks but engine won’t turn over. Battery seems fine, all fuses seem fine. Replaced the starter relays. Seems to clearly be a problem with the starter but could it be something in the driver’s side door creating a short in the system?
Gonna have to have it towed to the mechanic at this point. But would love to hear from anyone with thoughts about what may have gone awry.The Totally Integrated Power Module may have been damaged.

If you've heard of a TIPM, chances are you own a vehicle from Fiat-Chrysler (FCA). Think of it like a command center for all the electrical functions of your car, and in FCA's case a very, very disfunctional one.





TesterYou had the ignition on while working on the window and discharged the battery, recharge the battery.I concur with @Nevada_545. A weak battery was my first thought also while reading about the problem. Try cleaning the battery connections also. If the battery isn’t the issue then I suggest you check the safety switches to the starter.Well we had the battery unhooked while working on the wiring, it tested fine on the multimeter when we took it out, and before anything else we tried jumping it to no avail  could be that it needs more time on the jumper cables to recharge or problems with the ports but my partner seems pretty sure it’s not the battery.Check to see if power is getting to starter solenoid when in the START mode. If you have no power there then check the safety switches for the ignition. If you hear a loud click when you try to start it then you may have bad contacts in the starter solenoid. They can be replaced.You really need to clarify a few things.
Does that click sound come from the starter motor or from a relay in the underhood fuse box?
You state that both the battery and fuses “seem” fine. “Seems” means nothing without actually testing.
The battery might be a little ambiguous but the fuses are not.
So are you assuming those items are good or has any testing at all actually been done?We used a multimeter on all the fuses and the battery. We just replaced the starter relay - idk where the clicking is coming from, exactly? But it seems like it’s coming from the starter.An ohmmeter can be used to check continuity through the fuses but the voltmeter part of it may be iffy when checking the battery. A good fully charged battery should show around 12.7 volts.
If the voltage has a sizeable drop when lighting is turned on or the starter solenoid is engaged (the clicking maybe) that would likely point towards a bad or run down battery. And make sure both battery posts and cable ends are clean. Sometimes they develop a scale on them which prevent a good connection.Check the voltage on the terminal that connects to the starter solenoid while you are in the START mode. If the voltage shows close to 12 volts and the clicking is coming from the solenoid then the solenoid contacts are worn out. You should be able to feel the solenoid vibrations when it is turned on. It is also pretty loud.",,,,
134,Is It Possible For A Fuel Injector To Work Fine When Cold But Malfunction At Operating Temperature?,Maintenance/Repairs,6,258,"Dont fret. I took my car in for a diagnosis today. You are helping me solve a mystery.
Can a fuel injector work fine when the motor is cold but malfuction once the the motor reaches operating temperature?
Just trying to narrow the possibilities. I have a no codes shudder during acceleration at operating temperature.
Thank you so much for your input and patience.


 ArgosNoble:

Dont fret. I took my car in for a diagnosis today.


How about telling what the diagnosis was ? That will help people give you better replies.@VOLVO-V70
Forgive me! Diagnosis was a “pending code” something about running “lean”


 ArgosNoble:

Can a fuel injector work fine when the motor is cold but malfuction once the the motor reaches operating temperature?


This is a common mode of failure in many types of electrical and electronic devices: thermal induced failure.
One case occurs because most materials expand with rising temperature, causing strain and breakage at a weak point.
When it cools the bits come back together.
Back in the '70s (in high school) I worked in a TV repair shop
One handy tool on the workbench was a can of “freeze spray” with a narrow nozzle.
It could spray (ozone depleting) freon on individual components to identify thermal failures.
A hot soldering iron could do the same in the opposite way.Sounds like you are getting the pending code P0171.  This is a two trip DTC (diagnostic trouble code).  That means that the condition must be detected on two sequential trips.  The basic trip is cold start, warm to operating temp and shut down and cool back down to ambient temperature.
The first time the code is detected, it is stored as a pending code.  If it isn’t detected during the next trip, it is deleted.  If it is detected on the next trip, it is saved as a DTC and the check engine light is turned on.
The code does not mean that the engine is running lean.  The O2 sensor is controlling the A/F ratio and keeps it in the correct zone.  But, in the computer (PCM or ECM), there is a table of expected fuel needed based on temperature, coolant temp, mass air flow and manifold vacuum and maybe some other parameters.  The fuel injection is having to inject more fuel than the table expects.  This is your LTFT (long term fuel trim).  When the amount of fuel needed is 20% greater than expected, a code is set.
Now the PMC is not actually seeing the amount of fuel being injected.  It is calculating the fuel used based on the fuel pressure in the fuel rail (at least what it is supposed to be) and the pulse duration (PD) that the fuel injector is turned on.  It can’t change the pressure but it does adjust the PD to compensate.  When the PD is 20% or more longer, the code is detected.
The mechanic should have looked at the misfire register to see if one cylinder is affected.  That would identify if there is a bad fuel injector that needs cleaning/replacing.  You could run a couple cans of Seafood or Techron through your fuel system and maybe that would work.
But the problem could be something else.  A leaking intake manifold gasket could do it.  A worn engine could simply be the reason.  You mechanic probably should have done a compression check as well.
One very common reason for this is a dirty mass airflow sensor (MAF).  They are easy to clean.  Also a manifold air pressure sensor (MAP) could also be the cause.
Right now, the first thing I would do is clean the MAF.  Also look for any possible air leaks in the intake duct between the air filter and the throttle body as well as a dry cracked PCV hose or PVC makeup air hose.@ArgosNoble I hadn’t seen your other thread when I made my earlier post, so my answer was generic. This is why it’s not a good idea to start two threads for one problem.Argos , maybe you should just start all over again . Make one thread , put the vehicle info and what you have done with the symptoms you have and close the other ones .
There just has to be a shop that can solve this .",,,,

It appears your transmission is on its way out and slipping . You need a transmission shop before you can’t make your vehicle  move at all.
Avoid the chain type places like AMCCO but do use a local independent.I would also check the engine and trans mounts. The engine may move far enough with bad mounts to yank your truck into neutral.",,,,

the correct one for your V8.Like @Mustangman says, wrong pump
The 5.2 uses a 60 psi, 33 gallons per minute pump
the 4.0 uses a 50 psi, 20 gallons per minute pumpI think the answer here would depend on exactly where you have connected the pressure gauge.  I would expect a 20 gpm pump to be satisfactory if you are just revving the engine. There is no significant load on the engine. The fact that the pressure drops to zero seems to indicate a blockage in the fuel line before the point your gauge is connected…or a nearly failed fuel pump.  How dirty was that water? Was it sandy?I suspect the used fuel pump you installed is in the same condition as the used fuel pump you removed. Worn out and the wrong pump to boot.It was very gritty I washed the back of my jeep (it’s my beater hunting ride) and needed holes in the back floorboards so I drilled some and didn’t know I hit the tank and all the water from the back ran into the tank (I didn’t know it at the time till I started driving and it started sputtering and shut off on meI got a buddy who derbies and he has small fuel cells I will get a tank and a pump from him when he gets back in town and hook it directly to the fuel rail and see if it fixes it if it does I’ll move to the filter and hook it up there and that will tell me if it’s the line got a blockage if that fixes it I’ll buy a new pump (the right one for the motor this time)     Btw thank you all for your input it’s very helpful to meI am suspecting the new filter has gotten plugged.

139,Transmission going on 2009 ford escape,Maintenance/Repairs,8,312,"Hey all!
I’m 16 years old and have been given my brothers old 2009 Ford Escape xlt to drive around once I get my license. Only problem is that after taking it to the shop they said the transmission is going on it, and and it is definitely noticeable when it drives. It shifts pretty harshly between gears. I’m not very knowledgeable on cars (although I love listening to car talk) and was wondering if it would be worth it to get a junkyard transmission and swap it or if I should just sell it off to some other shmo. I love this car in both the way it handles and the space it provides but I really don’t want it to become a money pit.
Also, if it’s a goner once the transmission goes, any recommendations on other similar vehicles that are around 2k?
Thanks in advance.How many miles on the car and I assume that the transmission has never been serviced anyway.
Before writing the car off why not change the fluid and filter? I know that my current and past Fords have been a bit touchy about trans fluid changes so that is done roughly every 35k miles or so. If the pan on the transmission is pretty clean with no sludge or metallic debris then all the better.
As for finding a good reliable vehicle for 2 grand you need to rethink this. Odds are a 2 grand vehicle will be much worse than what you currently have even if the trans has issues. You are getting it for free so don’t throw in the towel yet.Can’t believe I forgot to mention the miles. It has 170k. Again I’m not very knolageable on cars so please forgive my ignorance but can is changing the transmission fluid something I can do relatively easily at home or should I take it to a shop. We took it to one shop and that’s where we got the dying transmission opinion but I haven’t been able to take it to get a second opinion. I’ll try to find out more about what they said specifically tomorrow because my dad was the one who dealt with them.
I really don’t want to throw in the towel on this car yet because like I said I love it.
Another issue is that I have happen is that if the car sits for a while there is a burning smell when I start it for about 5 min. I think oil is leaking on some element that heats up but that’s a problem for another day.It’s possible the trans could be going at 170k miles if it has never been serviced regularly but I would not fret over that just yet. I would suggest changing the fluid first.
I think the early Escapes had a transmission dipstick but the 2009s did not. That makes it a bit tougher.
As for the burning smell I have no way of knowing without hands on. It could be a trans fluid leak or engine oil leak. Again. even with this issue don’t fret just yet.
I agree with a second opinion and even a third. Do not tell anyone what the first place told you. And stay away from the transmission chain shops such as AAMCO or Cottmans. I have some personal and not so favorable anecdotes about both.I’m definitely gonna take it in for a second opinion and take a more hand on approach to figuring out the problem. My dad isn’t too interested in getting it checked out and everything so the second I get my license (New Jersey is 17 for a probationary) I’m gonna do it myself and be a bit more proactive in taking care of it. Mine does have a transmission dipstick. The car has to be running to take the transmission fluid levels correct?
I did take the oil to get changed a little while ago when I first got my hands on it but I have no idea about the service history of the transmission fluid.etc
Thank you again for your help it is very appreciated.First of all I also say 2000.00 to buy a vehicle will get you more trouble then you need.  Where is the money for a rebuilt transmission going to come from ?  What is the condition of this vehicle  ( tires - battery - brakes - will it pass state inspection if you have one ) .
Since you can’t put this in your name and you will have to be on your parents insurance then they have the final say about this vehicle.I’d also say to change the fluid and filter first. No idea how it is on that car but it’s usually not difficult to take the pan off and do it. If there’s no difference then get another opinion on the transmission.


 petermaloney211:

The car has to be running to take the transmission fluid levels correct?


Yes for some cars, no for others. Follow the procedure in your owners manual.
I would change the trans fluid - making sure to use the type spec’d by Ford in the owners manual. Even better, remove the trans pan, inspect for debris, and change the filter if there’s one in there.
Good luck!Since you state that the engine oil  was recently changed I strongly suggest that you examine the oil filter and the oil drain plug just in case someone double gasketed the oil filter, omitted the drain plug gasket, or whatever. Any of that can lead to oil leaks which can burn on the header pipes.
As to checking the transmission fluid, here you go. Main thing in the early stages is make sure the trans fluid is not dark brown or black as that is a sign of trouble.

140,Car pulls in both directions,Maintenance/Repairs,4,261,"So my car was parked in a parking lot where I work. It was hit by some one drunk leaving the establishment. I religiously park with my wheels straight.

Now when driving after cornering my car pulls in the direction of the corner I just took. Also doesn’t feel right when cornering. I don’t really know how to describe it.

You need a new collision place. Don’t even take it back to them for a car wash. If the wheels were really turned farther to the right than you can turn them normally, that means something broke. I have my suspicions as to what that something is, and that’s without even seeing the car.

141,2012 Acura TL oil warning/oil life,Maintenance/Repairs,6,325,"Hello, I bought my car about 3weeks ago and a warning of low oil popped up on my screen.  It’s a 2012 Acura TL SH AWD.  It’s obviously burning oil quickly.  Also, the little screen in front of the steering wheel says oil life is 90%.  Is 90% ok or do I need to add oil?  What is an ‘ok’ oil life percentage?  Thanks so much in advance!A.  You need to check the oil level with the dipstick at least weekly.  Add sufficient oil to bring it to the full mark.
B.  The message might have been low oil pressure warning.
C.  The 90% reading is the remaking oil life remaining  ,  when it reaches 0% you must change the oil.  I change mine at 15-20% oil life remaining.
There is the possibility the oil pressure sensor is failing.  But that does not absolve you of the responsibility to check the oil level.Agree with everything @Purebred posted!
You also should read your owners manual so you know what these lights and warnings mean. Especially the red lights and lights that flash. Both mean you should pull over as quickly as is safe and stop the car and engine.

 fitguy257:

You are confusing oil LEVEL and oil LIFE.
If the oil’s “life” is at 90%, it means that the oil needs to be changed very soon.
On the other hand, if the oil level is low, the engine could self-destruct before you can even get to a shop to have the oil changed.
Step#1: Lift hood and check the dipstick
Step#2: If–as I strongly suspect–the oil  level is low, you need to replenish it before starting the engine again.   Be sure to use the same oil grade/type/viscosity that is listed in the Owner’s Manual.


 VDCdriver:

If the oil’s “life” is at 90%, it means that the oil needs to be changed very soon.


No no no.  It means that 10% of the oil life has been used and 90% is left.  I usually changed oil at 50% left in my TL but some people like to let it get down to 5% or zero.  I don’t recall anymore if my 2012 TL had a low oil warning or not.  It never used any oil or not.  You will have to check the oil level with the dipstick.  If it is in fact down a quart, you have an oil burner or a leak and no good will come of it.  If the message is low oil pressure, that is also an indication of doom and if true the engine will not last longer.  So you really need to read the manual and the specific message you are getting.  If low oil or low pressure, it needs to go to a shop for evaluation, now.  If you would have bought my TL, it would have been in perfect condition with no oil usage and oil changed every 5000 miles.


 Bing:

No no no. It means that 10% of the oil life has been used and 90% is left.


I stand corrected in regard to “oil life”, as my car doesn’t have that technology. 
However, I am very concerned that the OP’s oil level is low, and that he could wind-up destroying the engine.That engine shared with MDX is known to consume oil in 2010-2013 year range. You need to immediately check the oil level.

Car fax history shows no issues/no salvage title and it’s guaranteed buy.  It also shows “car has been stoled & recovered within 20 days”. Inspection report looks good. And the authorized audi dealer service reports after car is recovered didn’t have anything suspicious. The car still has some manufacturer warranty left. The car was bought in auction that was bought by this local dealer I went through.
Can I go ahead and buy the car?
Have two questions,
i)Will my title show “clean” after the car transferred to my  name?
ii)Will my resale value have any impact considering “stolen/recovered” part?
I love the car and please provide your valuable suggestions on this.You need to have the car inspected by your mechanic.  This needs to be a mechanic who works for you.  You want to pay the inspection fee yourself to remove conflict of interest.
If it passes a thorough inspection, the frame is straight, and the wheels are properly aligned, I’d consider it.Forget this thing . Since it was stolen and recovered then sold at action I doubt if the factory warranty is still good .  No one here can tell what the title will say .
Also if you look at the Carfax web site it clearly states they only have what is reported to them .Thanks for your reply. Assuming that car inspection report comes good, can I go ahead and buy the car? do you know if there will be issues with title status for the car? And also will it affect the car value in future when I go for sell?Thanks for your reply. How do I confirm if the factory warranty remains valid or not?Possibly. As pointed out - get it inspected by a mechanic you trust. And I’d not pay a lot for this vehicle no matter what the report shows.You are asking questions that your local DMV ( where ever that is ) can answer .  And yes if the future Carfax or any other reporting service shows something it will effect your resale but that amount can’t be predicted .
As for the warranty your local Audi dealer can answer that . What do you mean by not authorized dealer ?
As for your replies they are seen here by everyone so you do not need to reply to each one .Is there another 2018 Q5 available near you?  It’s pretty common. I’d rather buy one without this problem, it’ll show up when you try to sell, I’d imagine.


 sunny89:

How do I confirm if the factory warranty remains valid or not?


Call any Audi dealership’s service department, read them the entire VIN, and ask them to verify if it is still covered by the factory warranty.
But… consider this old saying:
Drive it like you stole it.
I hope the OP realizes that the vehicle was undoubtedly abused by the thief before it was recovered.In my limited experience a title that has any sort of marking like “salvage” retains that marking forever, through multiple changes of owner.  The history that Carfax reported will not go away.  The reason the price you are being offered is attractive is because of that history, and that discount in value will continue for many years.  You have not uncovered a deal.
Two year old cars that have low mileage are valuable used cars and the best of them are resold through authorized dealers as “certified”.  The next best may be sold by the same dealers, but not certified.  The third class is decent cars with some flaws that are often sold by dealers of competing models.  When you get to cars that are sold at auction that are 2 years old you can expect they are cars with some pretty bad issues in their history.  They are cheaper because you are gambling, and if you don’t have it fully inspected by your own expert you will almost certainly lose.Just remember that a mechanic checking the car out, will have no idea what the insides of the engine or transmission look like unless it is disassembled.  So it could have been hot rodded for 20 days taking thousands of miles of life out of it and no way to tell.  like Bruce Williams used to say, never fall in love with something that can’t love you back.“I love this car” gives me pause when it applies to a car you don’t know and don’t own. It clouds your judgment.
I might love my 1999 Honda but it took time and shared experience for that feeling to develop. When it was new I just hoped it would turn out to be a good choice that I would not regret.


 sunny89:

Assuming that car inspection report comes good, can I go ahead and buy the car?


If the car has a clean title now, I don’t see why not.



 sunny89:

do you know if there will be issues with title status for the car?


No, I don’t know.  That would be a question for the seller of the car and would depend on the laws where you live.
Will the seller be registering it for you like a dealership would, or are you on your own to register the vehicle?  What does your DMV require by way of paperwork to register a vehicle?  Will you need a signed-over title and a bill of sale, or just one or the other?
If you’re going to have to register the vehicle yourself after the sale, find out what you need from the seller to do that, and make sure you get what you need from the seller before you close the deal.



 sunny89:

And also will it affect the car value in future when I go for sell?


Until you sell the car, any discussion of projected value and depreciation is completely theoretical.  Nobody can predict what it will be worth and whether any particular issue will affect the value.  A large part of it depends on who you sell it to, and whether that person cares about the vehicle’s past.
There are two schools of thought here:

One school of thought is that a car’s past doesn’t matter.  Only its current condition matters.  If the car was wrecked and fixed properly, why should I care that it was wrecked?  If a car has a properly-installed rebuilt engine, that means the engine is newer than the rest of the car, a bonus.
The other school of thought is that a wrecked and repaired vehicle can have unseen damage or issues, particularly related to electrical problems, that can be difficult and expensive to diagnose and fix.  When you buy a used car, you’re buying someone else’s problems.
I’ve found the listing and it’s at a place called PNW Luxury Cars, the carfax does show a stolen report and shortly thereafter a recovered report. It looks to have had a pattern of visits to the dealer in Beverly Hills on a regular basis even though it averaged under 5,000 miles a year with the previous owner.
https://www.pnwlux.com/auto/used-2018-audi-q5-20t-quattro-premium-plus-seattle-wa/48949382/ 17Based on that me thinks the OP is being lulled by the low mileage.  Low mileage is not necessarily a good thing if it was in the shop a lot compared to a car that was driven a lot and performed well.  So stolen, in the shop a lot, low mileage-I’d be inclined to go for the 57K one for the same price.

in the shop a lot


The vehicle was in the shop twice for unscheduled maintenance, one for brake bleed and the second for a wheel repair or center cap.One of our cars was stolen from my daughter while she was at college. The thieves broke into the house, stole a bunch of electronics, tossed it in her car and drove off. The keys were on the kitchen counter. It was recovered within a few hours. We knew where it was within 45 minutes of the report because OnStar located it, but it took the police a while to get it. When we sold the car to a dealer, there was no discussion of the theft. It did not have a salvage title. The car ran the same after the theft as before. Your Department of Motor Vehicles can tell you whether you need to disclose the theft. If you live in Maryland, I just told you about the issues you wonder about and you don’t need to contact the DMV.

I didn’t see that anywhere but the question is still why 10,000 miles on an '18?  Plus it looks like they want $7000 more than the same thing with 57K.  So stolen or not must be a cream puff owned by a little old lady,


 Bing:

why 10,000 miles on an '18?


Not everyone drives excessively, I service many low mileage vehicles, some come in for the first oil change after 18 months.
Yesterday I worked on a 2013 with 33,000 miles, today a 2019 with 51,000 miles, the second customer consumes a lot of fuel.
I am like the first guy, I bought a used car in 2012 and put 38,000 miles on it since, George would fear that it will wear out prematurely if not taken on joy rides once a week.

This line of thinking is reasonable when you are buying a 15+ year old car for $3k or less.  When you are looking at a car that old, and with such a low dollar value, issues such as a salvage title, or past body/mechanical repairs are not too important.  Maintenance records will be unavailable, because cars that old have often been through several owners before the one who’s offering it for sale now.  As long as the car is currently in good condition and runs fine, you take your chance.
However, we are not talking about a $1500 car, or even a $3k car here.  We are talking about a $33k car, and I would be very concerned about history at this price point.",,,,

 MaryLawrence:

Uh oh.  Heater not working due to low coolant due to:  leak, neglect, head gasket.  Sorry had to say it.  Classic sign.  Been there.Get this to your dealer immediately, preferably with a tow, or at leas t a refilled radiator (properly done).  You may need an engine replacement (under warranty).

It’s 7 years old though.  Is there an extended engine warranty?Hyundai vehicles have a 10 year/100,000 mile powertrain warranty for the first owner. Repairing a coolant leak on the engine might be covered, a damaged engine caused by driving with insufficient coolant will likely be rejected.",,,,

Things that will keep an engine from starting:
No fuel, no air, no spark, no power. Have you rechecked wires and connections?Did you try resetting the security system? If not I suggest you do that and then try starting the engine.The Explorer Sport-Trac never had a 3.0L, engine. Yours would’ve come with either 4.0L SOHC V6 or a 4.6L V8.  Your problem is likely that the PATS is not talking to your donor engine’s ECU, and therefore the command to energize the fuel pump isn’t being made. The ECU will have to programmed to accept your existing PATS code or vice versa.  Either way, you’re probably not doing it yourself.",,,,

146,2008 Audi A4 Heat Problems,Maintenance/Repairs,8,250,"I’ve been without heat in my car for about 2 years now and haven’t looked into getting it fixed because I don’t want to pay a fortune taking it somewhere not knowing what’s wrong with it. Any advice is GREATLY appreciated.
Simply my car just isn’t blowing out hot air unless the rpms are up and even then it’s only lukewarm air that doesn’t last long. Was told it could be water pump but my car isn’t experiencing any overheating. I’m thinking heater core or maybe air bubble and lines need a flush. Is there anything I could possibly try myself before taking it in to a mechanic?? Any help is appreciated as winters coming again and it’s miserable without heat.If you never add antifreeze to your system…that is, if you are not losing antifreeze, then this is likely to be low fluid and/or an air bubble. Go on YouTube for your car and see if somebody has a video.
If getting rid of the bubble does not solve the problem, then the control valve might be bad (I found mine disconnected…not an Audi.) Or, it might be a heater core that is plugged up.
In the long run, you should find a good independent mechanic you trust, and not let ANY problem go this long without a clear diagnosis.Does the car come up to the proper temp when running? The middle of the temp gauge…
Are you loosing coolant?
When you move the vent controls on the climate control around does the airflow change locations… defrost, vent from floor, dash ect.
Does the AC work?Water pump is a reasonable first guess.

Water pump is a reasonable first guess.

If the water pump was defective… wouldn’t there have been some serious overheating issues over the
2 years that this problem has existed?Temp and coolant are fine. AC does work and front and back defrosters work when needed. No problems with directing air flow eitherNot always. There might be enough water flow at lower engine speeds to prevent overheating but not enough to squeeze through the small tubes in the heater core.Given your answers to my questions… expect a diagnostic fee to even find the problem. This is going to take “hands on” the car to find the problem. You will not know the cost until a mechanic makes a determination.
I don’t think its a bubble because that would have eventually gone away. Not a water pump either as the symptoms are the reverse of a bad pump. Clogged heater core, blocked vent, broken blend door maybe.

Yes, …What constitutes a “large amount”? Many vehicles have water coming out of the tailpipe, caused by the catalytic converter. Have you checked the coolant level to confirm that you’re losing it? Checked the condition of the oil?

148,2019 Chevrolet Colorado radio issues,Maintenance/Repairs,35,18.7k,"Is anyone having radio issues in the 2019 Chev Colorado. Sounds goes up all on it own, and 1 time the sound blasted all the way up and scared the crap out of me. Took it back to Betley in Salem NH, and they put a new radio in it. I’m getting the same issues. Also the radio goes on every time I start the truck up. Even though it is shut off, when I turn the ignition the radio goes on. I went back to Betley and 4 dealers and 1 manager did not know this, so I took them all outside and we went into 4 different trucks and the Colorado is the only one that does this if it has a 7"" screen. Tech support told them to perform a A11 on new radio and it still didn’t fix it. I’m on my second call with the attorney general because this is crazy stuff that no one is willing to fix. Think of the safety if the sound cranks up and I stir the wheel wrong from being scared out of my mind. Betley told me it was my problem.Also elevate your problem up the corporate chain.  There should be information in your owners manual on the procedure.
I have a question, I was not clear on.  Did ALL the other Colorado’s on the lot do this or only yours?  I wasn’t clear on the wording of your statement.We tried 4 vehicles, and only the Chev Colorado with a 7"" screen did this. Not even the Silverado, nor the big Traverse did the radio come on once the truck was started. So out of the 4 tested, 3 of them did not have the radio come back on when started. Funny thing is 3 dealers and 1 manager didn’t even know this truck did this, until I proved it to them. When my dealer went over the truck with me, not once was this brought up.I just went through the owners manual, looking for anything about the radio going on, when truck started. They is nothing to be found, either in Radio, or Informative System.What I meant about the owners manual was how to elevate your problem to corporate level.  I agree that the radio going to full volume could be a safety issue.  You should also check lemon laws in your state.  The way I am reading your post is 3 of the trucks did not have this issue.  Or all the Colorado’s with the 7 inch screen did, but without the screen did not?I assume you have a volume control on the steering wheel. If replacing the radio didn’t help, then maybe that volume control is sticking or otherwise acting up.Good point.Nope, no controls on steering wheel. But there is a God. I received a phone call today from my dealership, because I gave this guy a very bad review. I said you didn’t help me and you kept saying there was nothing that could be done, instead of saying lets figure this out. We said our goodbyes and 30 min. later he calls me back with a very easy fix to the radio. I go out and do what he said and it works. After many case #'s and phone calls, worth hours of time, this guy somehow figures it out. I call the manager and he can’t wait to talk with this guy and hopefully train all the others on how this radio works. It has no bells or whistles, just a simple radio. I asked for free over the top floor liners from weather tech for all my heartaches and time. The manager agreed and I can pick them up next week. I was not giving into them

What was the fix ?Maybe the fix was to adjust where the catwhisker touched the crystal (Do any of you old timers remember doing this on our radios?)There’s some  service bulletins for the 2018 Colorado that might provide a clue to what’s causing  your problem.  I suspect it will turn out an electronic module has failed, or requires re-programming.

Is it not your policy that we do not discuss problems on vehicles that are covered by a factory warranty? “It doesn’t matter if anyone else had this problem, take it to the dealer and have it repaired” is a common response by a certain few.
People want to know how problems are resolved on vehicles that are covered by warranty even if you are not interested, why would you want to know the solution this time?Curious minds need to know what the solution was. I wonder if removing the memory power fuse for a short period cleared the issue.
@Triedac
I doubt adjusting the cat whisker had anything to do with solution to this issue. That kind of goes along with the tube getter and grid leak biasing. Oh the memories.Software updates for audio and navigation systems have become common in recent years. For GM vehicles these updates can be sent “over the air” via On Star. The vehicle owner must agree to the  terms and conditions  before the update is completed.I think Triedaq and I are on the same wave length (radio pun intended).
OP: “It has no bells or whistles, just a simple radio” and “it has a 7” screen.""
I never did get the Cub Scout crystal radio kit, but my first “real” radio was a Heathkit AR-3, and my first transmitter was a converted surplus BC-459 (aka ARC-5).
“Real radio bounces off the sky.”The fix was for me to go to the settings button, on the radio, press the sound button and I had a choice of 2 options, 1 was to turn the volume down for start up, (it was almost all the way up) by sliding the bar all the way left. I did that, shut off the truck, came back in 5 minutes, turned it back on and the radio did not go on. How easy was that? I went through the manual so many times and this was nowhere there. I told the manager that this was a very important feature to have in the manual. I had 4 open cases with tech support and no one figured this out. And because it was not reported by anyone else I looked like I was the crazy one. 2 weeks of hell and all I had to do was push 2 buttons and move a sound bar. When I do start the truck now I push the radio button on and it shows as muted, but then I turn the volume button and sound comes on. I’ll live with that.Thank you for sharing your story and the solution.Did this fix your volume going up? Im literally having the same issue with my 2019 colorado.Glad you got it resolved, the radio in my 2017 ram comes on when you turn the ignition on but atleast it does not blast it at you it just sits at the volume you last had it on. There are more and more features that are becoming tied into the radio and for these to work the radio needs to come on for them to work, backup camera being one example. You could say it is a computer interface with a radio feature.",,,,

On 12/03/20 at about 9:57 AM as I slowly turned left into a parking next to a white big truck then stopped and right before I could shift gear from D to R in order to back my car into my company EV charging parking lot, the car suddenly sped forward climbing over the curb, going thru the median separating the parking area from a driveway on the side of another company’s building then heading fast toward the building before I slammed on the brake in time to stop the car 15 ft away from the building. The entire incident happened with my foot off from the drive pedal. My driver side of the car scraped a tree on the median and got damage on the side + the side mirror.
I have been driving my car daily to work for the last 6 months and backing up my car into my company’s EV charging parking lot has been a daily routine with safety and caution. The unintended acceleration caught me off guard such that I could not even brake early enough to stop the car on the median! The Tesla was towed to a Tesla Service center in Fremont 2 hours later for evaluation and they reported the next day that there was no error by the car itself based on their analysis of the data log when the incident happened.
My car was towed to the Auto Body shop by my auto insurer.

152,Intermittent vibration,Maintenance/Repairs,21,16.5k,"Hi all,
I have a 2008 Mazda3 (2.3L automatic, 34K miles), which has recently been annoying me… The problem started about 4 months ago, when I got new tires and a brake job (pads + rotor resurfacing). Ever since, it has been having intermittent vibrations. I feel the vibrations mostly on the floor, but sometimes also on the steering wheel. Here’s what I’ve done so far:
When the vibrations started, i thought it was a problem with the new tires. I had them re-balanced 3 times at two different places, with no improvement. I then took the car to the dealer, who replaced two of the three engine mounts (it appears these tend to break easily on this model). This seemed to improve the situation for about half a day, and then it went back to the same. I took it back to the dealer, who could not find anything wrong. Not being satisfied, I took it to a different dealer, who could also not find anything wrong.
So, I am now stuck with this vibration…  It is not always there, and not always of the same magnitude… it seems to be more likely to happen in the morning after a colder night (well, as cold as it gets in Los Angeles). It is most likely to be felt at around 45-50mph, but you can also feel it at higher speed sometimes. A couple of times I could definitely feel it at around 25mph. Also, I’ve noticed that the engine vibrates when the car is stopped, at around 1500-1800rpm (e.g. when I first turn it on). The dealer claims that this is natural for a 4-cyl engine, but I had never felt a vibration before.
My gut feeling is that this is something related to the engine, but two different dealers could not find a problem… since this is intermittent, it is hard to nail down I guess. Any suggestions as to what this may be? Perhaps I could ask the dealer(s) to check specific things…
Thanks!I am thinking out load but  a good friend of mine has a 09 ford focus which shares a lot of commen parts w/mazda 3 he has a small shutter in his car’s torque conveter. or your mechanic that that the tires and the front brakes over torqued the lug nuts when he put the front tires back on the car. or did he cut the rotors or just clean them up? i would have someone check your front rotores for runout (warped) and retorque your wheels with a torque wrench( if you have alloy wheels)and not an impact gun.This vibration issue is always a slippery slope. I just spent way too much money and wayyy to many head-aches over leaking parts just to find out my new tires were crap.
Do you have anyone in your family with a similar wheel/tire size? Maybe find out on Tirerack if the wheel pattern is the same and get someone to loan you their wheels and tires for a drive. It is a pain and a lot of work swapping 2 sets of tires back and forth but it will rule out those tires you bought. That is how I found the tires were bad on my car. I didn’t have to look any further than my wife’s Dodge wheels that fit on my Chevy Monte Calro.Has anyone done a front to back rotation of the tires?  You could have a bent rim.You did two things to car at once. Tires and brakes. It seems you covered off tires mostly.
Maybe have another look at brakes. Our Subaru was exhibiting vibrations intermittently which turned out to be a seizing caliper. If you slam brakes does it go away?My tires balanced out perfectly on the balance machine… They just weren’t round tires. Mine were Uniroyal, I talked with the original installer and he suggested I contact Uniroyal about my issue. One phone call, two trips to a more local installer (one for inspection of the tires and a second for installing a different set) and i have 4 new Michelins on my  car for very little difference in my first purchase price. Mine were about 4 months old and had about 4Kmiles on them because my car had been in and out of other shops trying to chase down the vibrations.
I was concerned I had no recourse to tires I hated. It turns out we do.The intermittent and variable nature of the vibration tends to point away from tires.
I’m leaning towards an engine issue as the vibration is reported when the vehicle is idling - AND engine lounts improved it.CapriRacer
You could be correct on that assumption. I was just implying that just because a shop got the tires to balance doesn’t mean they are always smooth riding afterward.Thanks everyone for your input! I’ve had the tires rotated and unmounted/remounted several times, that did not seem to change anything. The shop also said they checked the tires and found them round… I’ve asked them a few times about the brakes, but they insist that nothing they did on the brakes could be causing this… plus I’ve been there so many times, that they are less than happy to see me at this point. Because of the intermittent nature of this, they have been unable (or unwilling?) to feel it, and told me I am ‘over-sensitive’ to vibrations… which of course is not true, since everything was fine until I had the work done.
If it is an intermittently seizing caliper, is that something that can be easily diagnosed?
Thanks again!W30post: the idea of swapping wheels for a day also occurred to me, but I haven’t found anyone whose wheels match perfectly… so I was wondering, how dangerous is it to use wheels that are somewhat different?Also, it does not seem to go away if I brake (gently) while it is vibrating… If I were to slam the brakes, it would go below 45mph quickly, at which point there is no vibration anyway…I don’t think it is the brakes.  You need to have someone put a dial indicator on the wheels, not the tires but on the lip of the rim and rotate the tire to see if the rim is bent.  Rims can get bent during the unmounting of the old tires from them (not from removing the wheels from the car).Another test that can be performed with a dial indicator is for wheel bearing play.  If the dial indicator indicates that a rim is bent, before changing the rim, have the brake rotor removed and checked for trash or a rust buildup which can make a rim appear to be bent, even when it is not.If the offset is slightly different, the total diameter is slightly bigger, those things will not matter. I looked up your car with some guesses and it has a large offset. Bolt pattern is key. You do not want to stress the lugs at all. rim diameter may be a consideration because of brake clearance.If the shop does not have a dial indicator for this task, then they might just pull the wheels and the rotors and clean the surface of the hub and the inside of the rotor where they mate.  Sometimes that’s all it takes.The Mazda 3  has a common problem with the passenger side engine mount that can cause vibration.   It’s not hard to remove and check it.   The link below has more info.
http://www.mazda3forums.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=a0b3e8c23ea1879eb7867a18176881b1&topic=119411.0 29My VW with many more miles at the time had intermittent vibration while traveling at freeway speeds.  It was a CV joint going bad.thanks all for your ideas! I just took the car to a newly paved road that’s almost perfectly flat, and was able to get the vibration at around 20-25mph. Not as intense, but definitely there (it would be nice to see if the vibration was at half the frequency as well, but could not tell). My guess is that at such low speeds the tires and rotors should not have enough moment to cause a vibration (correct?).
The next thing I am itching to try is to tape my camera phone under the hood, and record video of the engine as I drive… that would be cool in itself, but may also give me some evidence I can rub in the dealer’s face. Now
About the lugs: on the second-to-last time I took the car to the place where they mounted my tires, they said they made sure the wheels were torqued to factory spec. They also told me they checked the rims, and they looked fine…
My fear is that this will be a combination of things (e.g., a little off-round tires, a slightly warped rotor, a slightly defective engine mount) that all resonate to cause this…I would caution strapping you Iphone under the hood. The engine heat may be too much and kill the display.
The vibration caused by my bad tires was also present at the low speeds, also present intermittently. The shop that said they were round, is it the same shop that installed them the first time?Before I forget to comment on this, wheels that are slightly different may not fit.  If they DO fit on the lugs, you may have issues with the speedometer misreading your actual speed, and you MAY have some small issues with a tranfer case.  Now, these issues won’t be bad if you’re going for a quick spin around the block, but there’s just something telling me it’s not a good idea.
In any case, if you’re getting the vibration when you’re idling, forget the wheels and brakes entirely - unless you have 2 problems going on.
Check your spark plugs and injectors, maybe even spark plug coils.  That’s my thought.  Start at the repairs that are least expensive.  If that doesn’t work, I’m just speculating, so come back and get another opinion!  LoL
Good luck.",,,,
153,Fiat 500x is great?,General Discussion,32,925,"I watched the most recent Motorweek last night. One segment was a long term test update on the 2020 Fiat 500x. They’ve had it for 9 months and someone on their staff drives it every day. They love it and say it has been very reliable. Amazing!  Well, I’m surprised anyway. Maybe Fiat isn’t as bad as we’ve been led to believe. I haven’t looked at the Consumer Reports ranking method lately, but a few years ago, their worst category had more than 4% problems. That’s a lot higher than 2%, but it’s still a 96% success rate. They also mentioned on the show that the Dodge small 6-cyl diesel is a well regarded engine. Is FCA better than we thought?Perhaps, but still best to trade in at the end of the 36/36000 warranty.


 jtsanders:

They love it and say it has been very reliable


even a blind squirrel finds an acorn sometimesI think that this is more theoretical than realistic.
It might be different in other parts of The US, but in my neck of the woods–where foreign cars abound–all of the Fiat dealerships have taken-down their Fiat signs.
They may still be servicing Fiats, but there are no Fiats in the showroom or in their lot so it appears that they are no longer selling them.   The dealership closest to my house still has its Alfa-Romeo sign posted, but the Fiat sign was removed months ago.


 VDCdriver:

I think that this is more theoretical than realistic.


I disagree. Motorweek tells you what they think, whether it’s good or bad news. On the same show they did I a first drive test of a 2021 Buick Encore GX. They liked the extra room of the GX compared to the slightly smaller Encore. They did not like how slow it is, taking a full 8 seconds to go from 0 to 60.


 jtsanders:

They did not like how slow it is, taking a full 8 seconds to go from 0 to 60.


How the world has changed! A 1983 Z28 that did 0-60 in 10 seconds was considered FAST! Makes me chuckle when an 8 second car is labled slow today.The world certainly has changed. The third car they reported on last night was the 2021 Porsche 911 Targa. 0 to 60 in 4 seconds, and they said it was slow. For a 2021 911, of course.Both Motortrend and Autoblog have given the 500X good long term reviews but i’m still skeptical of Fiat, one of our two nearby dealers only takes Fiat’s when forced to since it came with the Chrysler/Jeep/Dodge/Ram franchise. Their lone Fiat stickers for $29,000, before you bargain them down.
The world is certainly changing, Fiat’s are getting postive reviews while i know 2 new Kia Soul owner’s who’ve gone through the buyback process in the last few months. One’s getting a EV Niro but the other’s now drivng a Nissan Rogue. We’ll see how those hold up.Even cars that are crazy unreliable are not 100% unreliable.Buy it, keep it until the warranty is up, then decide.


 jtsanders:

I disagree. Motorweek tells you what they think, whether it’s good or bad news.


You misinterpreted my intent.  Yes, I agree that Motorweek is a credible source of information, but if somebody can’t find a dealership w/in a reasonable distance, then their hope of buying one is likely not realistic.At any rate, I’ll take a look at the employee sites once in a while and on a different model from FCA, the comment was the first 20,000 miles are fine but after that expect trouble.FWIW, Dodge and Kia (!) tied for 1st place in the 2020 JD Power Initial Quality ranking.  Having said that, I wouldn’t buy a Fiat since it appears the brand is going nowhere in the US market.  But the Jeep Renegade is based on the same platform as the 500X and I believe it’s made in the same factory

J.D. Power is similar to the Better Business Bureau in that they are both “pay to play” operations, wherein good ratings are… purchased.I’ve had a very dim view of Fiat since the time many years ago when a multi-line dealer I worked for took on a Fiat franchise. Every one of us mechanics said no, no, hxxx no. They did it anyway with the assurance it would boost the company dramatically.
Two weeks later when the first 2 transports of new Fiats was unloaded management was ecstatic. A few hours later not so ecstatic when they found out from the paperwork that every one of those new cars was actually now 2 model years old.
New fall models were appearing on the market and the Fiats (badged as Pininfarinas and Bertones, Spyders and X19s respectively) preceded the past year models.
Parts chain? There was none. It was zero. Warranty reimbursement? Also zero.

Parts chain? There was none. It was zero


Yup!
The Subaru dealership in my town started out as a multi-line dealership, handing Fiat, as well as Saab and Subaru.   The older guys there talk about having to strip parts from unsold new Fiats in order to perform warranty work on other cars.   The lag time for Fiat parts, according to them, was measured in MONTHS.
Anyway… In the just-released Consumer Reports Buying Guide, these are their comments on the 2021 Fiat 500X:
Highs:
Maneuverability, upscale features
Lows:
Reliability, ride, transmission, noise, idle vibration, touchy brake pedal, visibility, front seat comfort
(Is that ALL??  )


 VDCdriver:

Maneuverability


Well, at least it is easy to stick it in the last bay and let it sit until parts come in I knew a young woman in the early 1980s who owned a Fiat.
She only drove it in the city.
She would sometimes take a seemingly circuitous route to her destination, and another friend asked her why.
She made sure to not be more than a couple blocks away from a service station for when it conked out!
She also had a knack for choosing unreliable boyfriends.I think Fiat is doing something bad with this. I think it is too big to be a small car. Who wants a big small car? Keep it simple, Stupid, that’s what I would say",,,,

Does not matter , you need a good brake shop and they might be able to answer those questions.
Also it need’s to be towed to the shop. Not driven.To give the answer nobody else was willing to give, if brake fluid is indeed disappearing from the reservoir it’s because there’s a leak somewhere. That is a dangerous situation. Get it fixed.

why are my brakes spongy? why was my brake fluid gone?


Your pads are probably used up. The brake fluid level drops as the pads are used up. I agree with @Renegade you need to have your vehicle towed to a shop",,,,
156,Totally confused about a brake rotor replacement,Maintenance/Repairs,58,14.9k,"2 1/2 years ago I purchased a “used” 2004 Hyundai Sonata with only 100 miles on it. The car now has 26,000 miles. I recently took my car in for its annual safety inspection. I was informed that I had approx. 4-6 months left on my brake pads so I should begin thinking about taking the car in for new pads in the near future. About a week later, the brakes began making a grinding noise so I decided to take them to the mechanic right away to have the pads replaced. The mechanic told me I still had wear on the pads, however, the rotors (front and rear) would need to be replaced due to pitting and rusting. Needless to say, I was confused. I questioned how this could be, but the mechanic didn’t have much of a response. I then called the dealership and asked them about it. They stated that I hardly ever drove the car (10,000 miles per year) and that condensation was most likely pitting and rusting the rotors due to the fact that it “sits too much”. I drive in bumper to bumper rush hour traffic every day so I’m on the brakes alot. I have owned many cars in the past and I am NOT heavy on the brakes at all. My other cars rotors have always lasted at least 60,000 miles in the same type of driving conditions.

 Does anyone have any idea what could have caused the rotors to be pitted and rusted and yet the pads still have 6 months wear on them? I’m at a loss on this one.It does not seem quite right to me either.  You can get underneath the car to look at the rotors with a mirror and flashlight.  You can see some portions of the rotors through the wheels too.  Make sure that the swept area of the rotor as much as you can see, has not been reduced due to corrosion.  The swept area shoulld be as wide as your brake pads.  Go to car parts store to inspect a new pad for your car as a reference; they should be willing to accommodate you; if not find another store where your business might be welcomed.
By the way, there is no rule to prevent you from buying the parts and having a mechanic install them for you.
Normally, a little rust will be polished off with a few brake applications.
If you do get the rotors replaced, then ask for the old parts.  This will help to keep your mechanic honest or else get a second opinion.  I have doubts that all four must be replaced but anything is possible.Consider this approach.  You may need to replace the rotors, so check and see if your independent mechanic can find the Wagner rotors with lifetime warranty.  I see where O’Reilly Auto sells the rears for around 47.99, which is not much more than getting regualar rotors with a time warranty.  see if you can get the fronts that way, too.  At least that minimizes the cost of the rotors if the pitting occurs again.
10K miles should be enough to keep the rotors in good shape, in my opinion.  If there is any doubt about the two opinions offered by the mechanic and dealer, find an independent mech who can provide you with another opinion about why it happened.I 2nd the opinion on checking the rotor swept area.  However ensure you check both sides of the rotor which is best done if the wheel is removed.  You may have a pad which is not contacting the rotor due to rust/dirt on the caliper sliding pin preventing full pad contact.It is perfectly normal for rotors to rust on the outer edges and at their center.
Depending on atmospheric conditions, sometimes rust can speckle the rotors after a vehicle has only been sitting for a day or two. A few stops and it’s gone; no problem.
Regarding this grinding noise you’re getting; does this occur with every stop or only for a few stops after the vehicle has been sitting overnight, etc.?[b]What you’re describing isn’t all that uncommon.
Pitted rotors are a result of inferior metal casting practices. When molten metal is poured into a casting, it must be done at a certain rate. If it’s poured too quickly, gas bubbles can form in the molten metal and leave voids in the casted material. These voids aren’t seen in the newly casted component.
When this happens with brake rotors, as the rotor surfaces wear, these voids begin to be exposed. And this is called rotor pitting.
Because these pits are below the friction surfaces of the rotors, rust forms in them because the brake pads can’t remove the rust. This rust builds up in the pits to where the rotor wears and the pads come in contact with this rust. This rust then begins to contaminate the brake pads. And an iron oxide contaminated brake pad or shoe will grind everytime the brakes are applied.
So, if the rotors are truely pitted, you need new rotors.
Tester[/b]Your brake rotors were made with slave labor from “recycled” cast iron scrap. We did you expect? Benz quality? Sorry…That wasn’t very nice.Thank you for your suggestion. I wasn’t aware that there were brake rotors with lifetime warranties. I think I will follow your suggestion and purchase the lifetime rotors so I avoid any future problems.
Thanks a bunch!Just be careful of any wear item that carries a lifetime warranty. All companies are in business to make money. If there’s a lifetime warranty on a part that is expected to wear out, there must be some way they can still make money on them. When a shop offers this type of warranty, they make it up on the labor to replace them. Sometimes, they actually wear out faster so they can replace them more often. Parts are free, labor is not.While crudely put, Caddyman’s response was correct.  “White box” rotors are made in China from low quality recycled metals and the labor is frequently prison (i.e. forced) labor.  You should always stick with name brand rotors and resist the temptation to go cheap.  At the end of the day you never go cheap on tires or brakes.  A cheap spark plug won’t kill you but bad brakes and/or tires are a recipe for disaster.These were the original brake rotors and pads installed by Hyundai. I did not sacrifice safety nor would I ever dream of doing so. Are you suggesting that Hyundai is using slave prison labor from China to produce their brake parts?any other hyundai owners out there who can comment on the brake/ rotor longevity?    im curious because the huge warantee hyundai gives MUST have SOME catch??!!
right?You can ask your mechanic to turn, or have turned by a parts store, your rotors. American cars have a stamped minimum thickness imprinted on them for how thick the rotors have to be, MINIMUM, for turning purposes. If you decide to have the rotors turned, (usually material is removed on a lathe-type machine in .001"" increments), that’ll get the rotors down to new, clean metal. Then any cracks or really deep pits will show up. If they’re marginal, toss 'em and replace with new. It is always better to get rotors turned where both inside and outside surfaces are turned (cut) at the same time. Reduces/eliminates warpage during the turning process, but a good machine operator can cut one surface at a time if he/she cuts in shallow, slow increments. Sharp cutting tools are an absolute must. Dull cutters= crappy results. Of course, new pads get put on whenever you do any rotor work. Don’t ever let anyone cut more than the mandatory minimum. Rotors dissipate heat as they’re used. Too thin rotors crack, warp, and sometimes just flat-out disintegrate because they don’t have the proper thickness of metal to properly and safely dissipate the extreme heat that all brake systems generate. Guess when the most heat is generated? Emergency stops. Would you want your rotors to break during an emergency stop? The for-sure repair is to replace both rotors and pads with new. But if you implicitely trust your mechanic, ask his/her opinion. Cutting the old rotors down might turn out to be a waste of time and money, but it is another option that you might consider. Vehicle business happens where the rubber meets the road, including the brake system. Most times, it doesn’t matter how fast you can go. It matters more how fast you can stop. Of course, a good mechanic will check out the rest of your brake systems for leaks, cracked hoses, etc. Don’t cheat on the brake system. Your safety, health, well-being and life depend on those brakes. The same goes for other human beings and animals.I just re-checked your original post. Only 26K miles? You probably don’t need to change out the brake fluid. However, another little trick that I do is to use a plastic turkey baster to remove as much fluid as I can from the master cylinder and replace with fresh, new fluid of the appropriate type. Again, ask your mechanic’s opinion. On my old junk, '92 Olds Cutlass ciera, '71 Chevy-10 L-6 engine, van with no power nothing, '85 Jeep Grand Wagoneer, (a.k.a.: Dragoneer), '92 GMC G-20 van, and my S.O.'s '89 Toyota Corolla AllTrac, (265K on it), I use all of these little tricks. With this old stuff, I completely flush the brake lines with denatured alcohol, blow air through the lines, completely replace the fluid, bleed and adjust. Of course, “while I’m at it”, I also carefully inspect the rubber seals on the ‘slave’ cylinders, just for the heck of it. Any cracks or leaks get fixed. The '71 van has 187K+, the '92 van has only 156K,(ONLY? ??), and the Dragoneer has about 147K. I won’t even discuss the '56 Allis-Chalmers WD-45 farm tractor. No gauges except for oil pressure and amp meter. I like old stuff. Old stuff works if properly maintained. Heck–I’M old stuff–and I still work pretty well.(Heh! Heh! Heh!).Sorry EveryoneYou just drug up an 11 year old thread and you could have kept it brief for easier reading.

thanks to one of our previous presidents


I know “the buck stops here”, but who seriously thinks a president is to blame for what the Chinese make brake rotors out of?You made some blanket statements about low quality from China. How do you know that all rotors from China are junk?  Also, I detect a sales pitch, since you tell us about your “high quality” alternatives. I replace my pads and rotors with mid-grade parts, and they perform well, no matter where they are made. I suggest you provide evidence for your claims.

157,Power Seat Adjustment ,General Discussion,22,538,"I recently purchased a new Jeep Cherokee.  For the most part I am pleased with it.  However I have one major problem.  The power seat does not tip low enough in the front.
I am a short person with a sciatic nerve issue.  What happens when I raise the seat to the proper height the front portion of the seat is too high.  It places excessive stress on the bottom of my right thigh.  I’d like the front portion of the seat to tip down much further (maybe and additional 2+ inches).  Does anyone know what midsized SUV’s power seat allows for the most adjustment, particularly the front portion?
Thanks,
SteveIf you adjust the seat to make your legs comfortable, what problems do you have?  I don’t understand what you mean about the proper seat height. Maybe whatever is out of adjustment when your legs are comfortable can be adjusted somehow. Explain the issue a bit more.You can try one of these
I believe the power seat in this works similarly to the one in my Subaru Forester, at least the switches are similar. The front of the seat will lower a little bit but may not be enough for your needs.Thank you for your suggestion – much appreciated.
I have purchased numerous seat cushions (over $200).  Some of them helped slightly but not appreciably.  The cushions raise me but because my legs are short I still have major pressure on the bottom of my thigh.  I need the front of the seat to tip down much further – probably 2+ inches.I thought I explained the problem - sorry.  I will try to elaborate a bit.
I have short legs.  I can adjust the seat forward and height just fine.  However the front portion of the seat is still much too high under my thigh.  No matter what I place on the seat the distance between the seat and the floor remains the same.  I need the front portion to tip down considerably more – maybe an additional 2+ inches.  I have tried numerous seat cushions to no avail.  I still have a major pressure issue under my right thigh.What I am looking for is suggestions on what (if any) other mid-sized SUV’s seats allow for more/most adjustment - particularly lowering the front portion.  I am considering selling the Jeep and purchasing something else if available.
Thanks again,
StevePersonal fit problems are just that, personal.  You need to check out the cars yourself.  You might drop by a Carmax and try out a number of them at the same time.Thank you for your response - much appreciated.
I agree that would be the most advantageous.  However, I live in a relatively small town with limited access to automobile dealerships, particularly foreign models.  I was hoping someone with more knowledge on this could help direct me in some direction so when/if I go on a road trip I could limit my search.


 esskaykay:

What I am looking for is suggestions on what (if any) other mid-sized SUV’s seats allow for more/


What might work for one person may not even be close to what you need .  Also the front of the seat adjustment might not even be used for many people so they will not know how rar it tilts down in the front.  This is just one of those you have to try it for yourself.Thank you - I guess I will move on.I’m short too and understand what you are saying.  One of the first things I do before buying is check the seat and see if there is enough adjustment to make it comfortable.  Our Acuras have been fine.  Maybe Honda uses the same frame-dunno.  My Pontiac and other GMs have been fine too.  I did rent a Jeep a couple times but don’t recall a huge problem with the seats though.  Feb., March is when they have the auto shows which is a good time to look at a few different brands.  Of course canceled last year and who knows about 2021.
Now I suppose it might be possible to raise the back of the floor track  that might lower the front but no dealer would do this and would depend on how the tracks are fastened.  If there is a company that does handicap modifications in the area, it might be worth a chat with them.  Way back in the 60’s, before power seats were common, Chrysler cars used to provide for mechanically changing the pitch of the seats in addition to to and fro.  Wonder if they still might have that option.  In that case the dealer would know.   No easy answers.My granddaughter is very short, 4’ 7"".  Not a “little person”, just tiny.  She weighed 2.2 Lbs when she came into this world, and will never big.
I made four blocks from 2X4 lumber to go under each corner of the seat of the  Ford Focus I found for her. This boosts the entire seat.  She’d have a hard time seeing out otherwise.
Could you get enough tilt out of the seat if you could raise the back with blocks under those corners?My sister-in-law is 5’ tall. She’s happy with the seating in her old Chrysler Town and Country and her current 2014 Honda Odyssey. Note that sometimes higher trim levels offer more seat adjustment. About all you can do is try out cars in the dealers lot and see if they fit you. When you go in, make sure they know that your seating problems are your highest priority. If they suggest the highest trim level, try the next trim level down to see if that works. You might also ask for the shortest salesperson on staff. Maybe they share your issue and can point you in the right direction.
It wasn’t clear to me whether if you move the entire seat to its lowest setting (front and back) that you could see the mirrors well enough. It seems reasonable that you could set everything else right for you and then try to tilt the seat down in front, but it wouldn’t go to its lowest level because the tilt angle doesn’t span the entire range of seat height. Now I hope I explained it well enough.Thank you for your response. I would have gotten back sooner but had some health issues.
I did speak to a couple Jeep dealerships and about this but that was pretty close to useless.
I am so bothered by this issue that if there is some other vehicle that has more seat adjustment I would seriously consider selling the jeep and purchasing a different vehicle.
Again my thanks for your input,
SteveThank you for your response. I would have gotten back sooner but had some health issues.
The seat height adjustment is fine. It’s just the distance between the floor and the front edge of the seat. Raising the back of the seat would tilt the seat more but not reduce the floor/seat distance which is my problem.
I am so bothered by this issue that if there is some other vehicle that has more seat adjustment I would seriously consider selling the jeep and purchasing a different vehicle.
Again my thanks for your input,
Steve@esskaykay, you only have to respond once if you say the same thing. Each response is shown on this forum. We can all show up here and read it.My trailblazer got rear ended and had to buy a new vehicle for trips to the cabin with the ability to tow a boat to the launch and back. Saw the 2017 Acadia limited, and knew my wife with a bad back would love it. Our other car is limited on passenger seat adjustments, so finding a car with full passenger seat adjustments, heated seats, heated steering wheel, remote start and a tow package was the deal maker for me and my wife. It is her car now and she loves it.@esskaykay

That was my guess, I don’t think 4 wheel ABS was available on 2500’s that year. RockAuto only shows a rear-only ABS hydraulic unit.wasn’t RABS known as being “temperamental” . . . ?!
was it one of those technologies that was developed just so that a vehicle could be “in compliance” . . . sort of like those awful motorized seat belts?Cheaper ABS…  made some sense on trucks that run empty and fully loaded requiring a large difference in brake force for those 2 conditions.

161,ASE “Composite Vehicle”,Maintenance/Repairs,17,3.7k,"In order to train and test mechanics in engine controls a ASE panel of experts have come up with a “composite vehicle” (it doesn’t exist it’s is just on paper)I wanted to list some aspects of how these experts equipped this vehicle.
 1. V-6 sequential fire, chain driven four overhead cams, 24 valves distributorless ignition,coil over ignition with a mass airflow sensor.
 2.No idle relearn after component replacement or dead battery
 3.No starter disable by anti-theft system
 4.Drive by wire throttle.
 5.Electric throttle position
 6.Variable position EGR
 7.Engine misfire detection by CKP (remember the post yesterday?)
 8.Brake pedal switch input (for TCC release
 9.Thermostat position monitoring
 10.PC based interface software
 This composite vehicle is used for the ASE L1 Advanced engine performance test. Some may not believe in the value of ASE’s but they hit a home run on this one.
 There are many more aspects to this vehicle but I am sure my audience is limited in size,many of our readers don’t have ant idea what these thins are,so I kept this realitive short.I’m one of those who do not put much credence into ASE exams and I’ve long since let all of mine lapse for the following reasons.

I’ve been promised by past employers “get this, that, or the other certification and you’ll get a hefty raise”. Well, pass the tests and no raise was ever forthcoming. Asking about the previously promised raise usually led to amnesia on the part of the boss.
Passing a multiple-choice test is not a sign of proficiency in any area because some of the finest techs I’ve worked with in the past cannot seem to pass an ASE exam to save their life. On the other hand, some people who really have no business turning wrenches may have the ability to randomly guess at the choices and pass.
Many years ago I even passed one ASE test in an area in which my knowledge was close to zero.

This is only my humble opinion here, but I’m of the belief that the main purpose of ASEs are a PR ploy (signs and patches denote excellence) and the testing fees and renewal fees keep the powers that be at ASE in salaries and expense accounts.
Just my 2 cents anyway.This one is quite different (L1) What I feel is that even if a man is good with his hands and has a good logical mind he still has to know these technical issues.The tests need only 70% to pass. I look at the tests and the prep material as the best way to get the technical side down. My College Automotive program Degrees are no better than ASE’s in guaranting competence and neither is WYTech or the BMW step-student program. Those guys have a 50K bill to pay and I can’t justify it.
I know you recieved your Master level Tech at your Dealerships myself I made it halfway at GM and halfway at BMW (as you know the who get’s sent to school is pretty political) and since I never will wrench professionally again I never will reach Master Level,but I can get Master Level ASE. The technical data that is presented is fascinating and vital for a drivability tech to know. It’s going to help me as a Advisor,I will be one of those Advisor’s that actually know the technical nature of whats going on,but I can’t sell worth a damn,must work on that.I agree woth ok4450 completely.  I have never even seen an ASE test, let alone a study manual/guide for ASE.  I’ve been in the business almost 25 years and worked at dealerships before opening my own shop and have done well for myself.  I have never had a customer ask me if I was ASE certified.  I could probably walk into a dealership tomorrow and get a job.  I’ve been out of the dealership mode for quite a few years now but I remember it used to be that you would have to prove yourself before you could make any kind of money.  They might start you out low but if you can show them that you can make them money and do it without a lot of screw ups and rechecks, your paychecks will go up.
transmanPutting the issue of value of having your ASE’s aside,what do you think of the composite vehicle they have assembled to teach driveability and OBD2 diagnostics? I have left out quite a bit of the composites vehicles make-up.
Just yesterday we were commenting on the desire to have a misfire detection feature,and they have included it and I like the way they have designated the vehicle with a no-relearn capability. I believe they have put together a very good representation of the systems a mechanic will find on a car of today.
Driveability is not a area you can just walk in and “wing it”. You may be OK at brakes and some more generic areas but not with driveability. Just like your area,your not going to get out of high school knowing transmission diagnosis and repair,today hitting the books is a PART of competency. What I am presenting is the best “book material” I have come across. Excellent section on analyzing scan tool data and 5 gas anaylzer diagnosis along with 02 sensor wave form analysis and fuel trim analysis.It has been my experience as a ‘master’ of another sort, that the label ‘certified’ or otherwise documented level of expertise only gets you in the door.
As another responder mentioned, too much emphasis is put on credentials (ala Bernie Madoff et al.)  When the true proof lies in performance.  I have worked with several well credentialed, highly educated, well recommended individuals who have proven to be somewhat less than adequate in ANY function of the job.  I am sure the same applies to the mechanical repair profession.  And you would probably agree with this statement.
However, the deeper problem lies with the ASE, AFSME, SNAME and many other alphabet soup lexicon agency’s who become an ‘industry standard’ when this only serves to promote the class society instead of the professionals they start out being created by and for.
My real life experience with ASE technicians is that the walls at Jiffy Lube are plastered with these diplomas.  Nope.  As Shania says: That don’t impress me much!
It is true that modern professionals need to be as adept at ‘hands on’ as well as being able to teach themselves from a book.  But in NO way is any of the book learning ever going to replace aggregate of the hands on ability and experience.  I feel these type of agencies are not a true ‘help’ or benefit to the industry or the individual.  The individual is the help to these societies.  Sort of like putting the emphasis on the wrong syllable, It makes no sense, but some insist on doing the same thing, to no avail.
As far as the ‘car’, of course there are basic simple ideas there to concentrate on, to let a prospective candidate get to the meat and potatoes of the issues.  A clear separation of problems and topic areas is nice to look upon to get the ‘feel’ of when starting out.  But…  when does this happen in real life?What I am asking and the question keeps getting shifted to the value of ASE’s, is do you think that the “composite car” model that the ASE panel has come up with is a good training tool?
Or cappy are you saying that classroom training has absolutely no value. If info from a book is of no value,well I don’t know where to go with this.
Do you think that just hanging around with the driveability tech is somehow going to teach you driveability? You have to crack the book, learn the system then put you hands on.
This driveability stuff is more brain work than back work. You have to know what the different data fields on your scan tool mean and what direction to take base upon that data.
The day has come with BMW that you are not allowed to do warranty work on cars that you have not recieved certification on, Tech assistance won’t even talk to you on the phone if you don’t have you model familarization. They require a certain number of Master Techs based upon the amount of cars the Dealer sells. This means taking the test.My opinion would be that it’s overrated.
A story I read in a trade publication some years back stated that techs who attend service schools only retain to any degree at all, about 15% of what they are taught.
For the time and expense I question whether the programs are worth it.
BMW (and they’re not alone) may require this or that but that does not mean that any tech is going to hang around long enough to become a Master Tech. Warranty headaches and pain in the neck dealer policy has a way of making many of them move on either before they attain Master status or not long afterwards.
While not related to the composite car I’ve got a great example of why Master Whatever means little if you would like to hear it and involves a guy I worked with who was an ASE Master Tech and a fully certified Subaru Master Tech to boot.Actually I disagree with the premise that you state: ‘You have to crack the book, learn the system then put your hands on.’
I feel that is backwards.  I have seen too many instances of guys/gals who are savvy with the texts, and just have no innate, practical mechanical knowledge, experience, or even ability. Without the two abilities working together what ASE stands for is useless.  I know of no way for someone to go get book certified (first) then be able be sure to be a ‘good’ mechanic.  Some  think  they are qualified just by the diploma.  Others  think  they need no more formal training.  Both are wrong.   BUT, I have seen too many people who can ‘pass the test’ who have no business being on the other end of the wrench doing the actual job.  You can substitute any other profession for the word ‘wrench’ in that previous sentence also.
However, As you stated the ‘composite model’ is a great idea in thought.  But the application is lacking.  I mentioned earlier that Jiffy lube uses these as wallpaper.  You are obviously an experienced mechanic with “probably” more than one year (Ha Ha) experience.  You have matriculated ‘up’ the system.  How many mechanics have you worked with over the years who bring in that brand new diploma and no matter how long they worked with you they just didn’t “get it”?  So what good is the diploma.
You mention BMW.  Does BMW recognize an ASE diploma? I doubt it.  You must go to a BMW class to be recognized by them.  How does that help you at BMW with a ASE certificate?The Technical Support section does not give any weight to ASE certification. You must have training from their training center to get the kind of certifications needed to work on paticular models (under warranty) and have them provide you with tech support (you can just have the Foreman or someone else ask your question). They said that they felt that their time was being wasted when they were asked for help on a system that the tech had no training on. In reality this policy worked in your favor at times, you were not stuck on a low paying warranty nightmare, you could go on with better customer pay jobs.
Much is being made of that the diploma doesn’t mean competeancy. So much so that one tends to wonder if you believe the diploma is a hinderence. Have you never met someone with the diploma and is also competant?
I understand how you feel about the ASE diploma (no value) so lets just concentrate on the value of the material they are testing on, its all good stuff that every tech should know wether he takes the test or not. If you grasp all that is presented in both the driveability sections (A8 Engine Performance and L1 Advanced Engine performance) you have a very good base to build on.
I would somehow like you to take a look at the material and then evaluate. I describe them as FSM’s with a more system theory nature,less cryptic. You come away understanding more than you would just following the flow chart for  a DTC from a FSM.I’ve known some guys who were both competent and had the diplomas. The only catch is that they’re in the very distinct minority.
Ponder this one. I consider FAA aircraft certification far more rigorous than any automotive testing simply because so much more is riding on the outcome of the repair: crashing instead of pulling over to the curb.
About 25 years ago my (ex) brother in law passed his aircraft mechanics exam that was administered by an FAA licensed examiner.
The problem was that my BIL is an absolute mechanical twit who could not even change his own spark plugs - and didn’t. Guess who serviced his cars? Me.
Now, how did he pass the tests? Simple. The examiner had a vested interest in making sure as many of his students as possible passed the exam so he coddled them through the entire thing.
The first time I took the written exam (different examiner) for aircraft powerplants I flunked; and flunked badly. It wasn’t even close.
After putting in some extra time (required additional hours for a retake) I took the written again about 3 months later, scored high, and passed all sections.
The point here is that my BIL can’t wrench his way out of a wet paper bag after 2 years of study in an FAA approved program, but we’re to believe a comparatively few hours of ASE study and testing will make someone proficient? Not in my opinion.This composite can be a useful tool to familiarize oneself with the different systems, the input values and the outputs (functions or malfunctions) caused by that said input or set of input(s) in a modern ECU/ECM. Back when I started Hands-on learning the electronic engine management systems where rudimentary at best , Cap and Rotor  days, as far as I’m concerned, getting certified opens up opportunities and creates the like, at more shops etc. That said… there is no education like good old fashioned, trial and error. Attempting to rectify an undesirable output from a vehicle with one approach, gathering all available information that these computers on wheels will provide,  failing then trouble shooting adjusting approach, changing technique, observing someone more familiar with the problem you’re faced with, eventually you find the fix. That is the process I have always retained the most insight and knowledge from. But that’s just me. I also have a couple Basic A.S.E module certifications.  I have no desire or motivation (career wise) , just the simple concept that knowledge is power, I try to learn 1new thing everyday. I am not getting certified,  just using the course modules to gain insight as to make is easier to tune my cars better. As well as fix any problems that may arise in the future.


 ok4450:

I’ve been promised by past employers “get this, that, or the other certification and you’ll get a hefty raise”. Well, pass the tests and no raise was ever forthcoming. Asking about the previously promised raise usually led to amnesia on the part of the boss.


I worked for my previous employer for 3½ years, busted my butt for them, extended myself for them, and got a whopping 50 cents an hour raise after the first year.  After that, each year at my performance review, they had endless excuses why they couldn’t give me a raise, but if I started doing X, Y, and Z then they’d up my pay.  Well, I started doing those things, but then they just demanded even more–and still no raise.
Finally, in January of 2017, the company decided to raise prices charged to the customer by 12% across the board, citing “inflation” and “economic conditions”.  I told my boss that if we were increasing our flate-rate prices by 12%, then shouldn’t the people who are actually doing the work receive a similar percent raise?  He laughed at me, and said if you don’t like what I’m paying you, find another job.
So I started taking time off work and applying at other companies, and attending interviews.  Well guess what?  I got a job at a different company, where I am still at today, and just the mere act of changing jobs brought my pay up by more than $4 an hour–far more than the meager $1 an hour I was asking for.  And now, I get a raise automatically each year, together with thanks for doing a great job.  No BS and endless excuses.
Oh, and my previous employer has lost major customers because he can’t keep employees for more than a few months, and apparently doesn’t think he should have to offer better pay.I did the same thing after each broken promise; moved on after lining up another job and giving them 2 seconds notice.
After spending 2.5 years going through every school and passing every test I was given Master Tech status at a Subaru dealer. SOA had a policy of requiring every dealer to have at least one MT. They had promised me 50% commission if I attained that status and per the usual reneged when I hit that goal.
Right after I had a vacation come up. I lined up another job, used my vacation by taking a motorcycle trip to Sturgis SD, returned and started yanking all of my Subaru. ASE certs, etc off the wall. THEN I heard a bunch of “what are we gonna do without a MT” wailing. Don’t care; you lied so bye. Funny part is I went to work for Nissan making 5 dollars per hour less on flat rate and my total pay each month went up by well over 30% with stress there being practically non existent due to the coolest service manager ever. He headed all crap off at the door and never let it reach the mechanics.I’ll say a few things about the L1 composite vehicle and ASE certifications
I’m currently L1-certified, along with several others.  14 total, I believe, both automotive and heavy truck
And you will not pass L1 if you don’t have a good head on your shoulders and some experience
In my opinion, the L1 is a fair measure of somebody’s diagnostic skills.  Somebody who is a poor reader, can’t interpret a wiring diagram, can’t approach things in a systematic manner will bomb at that exam, especially when you consider you only have a short time for each exam.  Gone are the days when you literally had all evening to answer the exam(s)
None of my employers ever cared about ASE-credentials.  Meaning they didn’t financially reward employees who had them.
The dealer only cared about their own “standards of mediocrity” . . . yes, that WAS intended to be snarky.  I’ve seen so many guys who couldn’t diagnose a flat tire, yet they were “master certified” by the manufacturer.  I think it was called “standards of excellence” . . . but it was a farce in my opinion.
Things may have changed in the last few years.  I haven’t worked at a dealership in over 10 years.  And I have no plans of ever going back.
My current employer also doesn’t reward ASE certifications.  But it’s because all mechanics get paid the same.  Meaning equipment mechanics get paid the same, heavy equipment mechanics get paid a slightly higher amount, and so forth.  There are “codes” such as noise, truck, night, odor and other things that you get, depending on what particular shop you work in
I’ve seen very few guys that actually display their ase credentials on their toolboxes.  All those magnets go in a desk drawer at home, along with the paper credentials.  If anybody wants to see them, I can log onto the ase website and print them out.



 ok4450:

the coolest service manager ever. He headed all crap off at the door and never let it reach the mechanics.


Does that include customers who would have been a waste of time for everybody, such as those that were trying to engineer a fraudulent buyback . . . ?!
I agree with you; a good manager knows what customers to send away
Even at my current job . . . which is as a fleet mechanic, some of our vehicle operators only drop off vehicles because they are wasting everybody’s time.  They complain about non-existent problems, so that they can tell their boss “My truck’s at the shop, I can’t do my job”I became ASE certified in the '70’s while working on my PhD in Physics. I had a lot of motorcycle experience and probably stretched the truth a bit about my experience level.  I said to myself that I was probably far more experienced at taking tests than any full-time mechanic .
We often see and hear mechanics throwing parts at a car without understanding that they are unrelated to the true symptoms. If a mechanic remembers only 15% of their book-learning, that is 15% to the plus side.  Aren’t we all learning a lot right here on this site without ever touching a car?ASE certification gets you in the door for your first job.Yes, the service manager I referred to would just sit there stoically and not say a word. When the customer got through ranting he would say there’s the door. Leave. Now.
One guy had been in multiple times for a brake shudder. Nothing could be found wrong even with  dial indicators or test drives. The SM finally said take me for a drive and show me this shuddder.
The guy went right outside of town, ran the car up to 85 MPH, and locked the brakes up. That of course led to wheel hopping.
SM never said a word. Came back to the shop, got out, and told the guy to get the hxxx of the lot and never come back again no matter what was wrong.
I had asked him one time how he remained so cool with this stuff going on. He said when someone started complaining he would just shift his thoughts to being at the lake fishing or taking his wife out to dinner on a Saturday evening. Just zoned out basically.
I’ve related my reasons for dumping all of my certs. The other side of is is ethics and competency. There was a long time local import shop here that is now closed as the owner died. The shop was plastered with ASE signs. The owner and every tech there was completely ASE certed to the hilt.
I cannot even remember  the number of people whose cars I fixed that they botched or who refused to leave their car there because it seemed that every engine performance problem was “an 800 dollar fix”; all diagnosed without even raising the hood.
A trashed VW because the timing was too far advanced,  a flex plate busted because they made an error seating the converter,  an engine swapped out because a valve shim had gotten chucked out of the bucket and a rod bearing got the blame.
Probably my favorite was a guy who owned an old Audi that was very low miles and showroom clean. It ran like garbage and the guy knew nothing about cars. That ASE shop told him it was an “800 dollar fuel injection problem”.
This was an Audi 100 that used a carburetor and the actual problem was that the distributor cam was dry and allowed the contact points to close up…took me 5 minutes to fix and ran like a Rolex.",,,,
162,Convert HID to Halogen,Maintenance/Repairs,6,278,"I recently bought a 2008 Lexus RX350.  The previous owner seems to have broken the crown of the right/passenger side headlight and glued the bulb into place.  I need to buy an entire assembly, but the damn thing is HID and the assembly costs almost $2000.  I hate HID and would much rather have halogen lights than spend $2000 just for the assembly (bulbs not included).
Does anyone know if an HID-to-Halogen kit exists?
What would it take/cost to convert the wiring?I suggest searching on a junkyard network for a replacement.
Conversion would be a fools errand.

Thanks, but I’ve tried all the junkyards in the Northeast.  For some reason, this part is extremely rare.  If it were a driver’s side assembly, it’d be easier.  It seems this whole escapade has been a fool’s errand.
I f*(&)(*^&n hate HID and LED.  It’s insane that I have to pay so much extra for lights that don’t help me see better, and actually cause a lot of pain and blindness in other drivers like me (muscle issues mean my pupils don’t contract).Too bad you are in the northeast, a hillbilly mechanic like me would be glad to drive up and make something work, My first thought is to take it to a body shop, and get a quote, ask about used partsTry car-part.com 1. You might also check eBay.Thanks, I’ve been keeping an eye on car-part.  I got one guy to answer the phone but I still don’t know how much he’s charging for the thing.  I’ve looked at Ebay, but that site always makes me nervous.  I’m never sure if the part is legitimate or stolen property.  Perhaps I’m overthinking.We’ve got plenty of hillbilly mechanics up this way   I’ve thought of it, but I don’t think my own hillbilly mechanic would know how to convert to halogen so I haven’t called him yet.  He’s semi-retired and I never know what days he’s in the garage.  I’ll definitely check out body shops.",,,,
163,Brake Rotor Question,Maintenance/Repairs,33,900,"Hi all,
So, I need new brake pads on my 2017 Mazda CX-5, and was informed that my rotors were in good enough condition to “turn” them.  Should I do this, or should I opt for new rotors?  I know that rotors have to maintain a certain thickness to “turn”, but I’m not sure if this is a better choice in the long-run.  Can someone help me out with this decision?
Thanks so much!Just ask them the price difference between turning and replacing .  There would have to be a large savings before I would turn them . This also one of those decisions a person makes that does not cause loss of sleep.Replace them.
The new rotors will have the proper surface finish so the new pads bed properly.
TesterOne would have to depend on their expertise. If they think turning them would be fine and they are a reputable shop I would trust their decision, as I do not have the ability to make a decision one way or another. You can always ask the difference in cost for good new rotors vs turning the old ones and go from there depending on price and confidence level in the shop. EDIT: Sorry to repeat I type too slowly I guess.Thanks, guys!  It is the Mazda dealership recommending turning them.  I will find out the cost to just replace them.You might also take the car to a local, independent repair shop for a 2nd quote.
You might be shocked how much cheaper the price is, compared to the dealer.Most shop that I have worked for, resurfacing the rotors was included in the price of the brake job. New rotors are $100 each. The cost difference is $200 per axle.Just as a side note it is nice the dealer is offering turning the rotors. We bought a used car in april and after a few long road trips would occasionally get a rumble in the brakes. Happened 6 to 10 times over 3500 miles. So they took me in the shop and there was much not sure how to describe it, bubbled up stuff on the outside of the rotors. High heat can cause this rumbling with rotors in this condition, got half off a $380 brake job. One never knows if one go a good deal or not, but I am happy enough. I wanted to let it go till spring after the salt season, but wife wanted it done so we did. Just trying to say one can not always have the perfect answer to any question.Stock rotors are usually higher quality material. I would have them turned this time. next time go to an independent shop and replace with aftermarket to save money.


 tcmichnorth:

Stock rotors are usually higher quality material.


You do realize that Mazda doesn’t make brake rotors/pads?
They buy them from a vendor.
This may be Raybestos, Wagner, Bendix, etc…
So an aftermarket brake component that meets/exceeds the manufacturers specifications may be the same component that came on the vehicle at the assembly line.
Or better!
TesterYes, but the rotors they use are high quality using premium material. When I buy aftermarket I go to autozone and buy the mid-range. These rotors I wouldn’t turn, but I know the rotors that came stock are worth keeping through at least one turning.


 Nevada_545:

. New rotors are $100 each.


Is that the customer pay price at the shop?  OEM brake rotors for my Mustang (with the big 6 pot Brembos) run about $60 retail. Rotors for the customer’s vehicle run around $40-$60 retail.Pro-Demand labor guide shows $99 for each rotor.



 FoDaddy:

with the big 6 pot Brembos


Front brake job on a Lexus ISF costs over $1,000 with OEM parts.


 Nevada_545:

Pro-Demand labor guide shows $99 for each rotor.


So is that what your shop charges regardless of what the actual price of the rotor is? Or is that what they say the price should be on average including mark up. If the cost for the rotor is around $60-$70, then a price of $99 (including markup) isn’t totally unreasonable.



 Nevada_545:

Front brake job on a Lexus ISF costs over $1,000 with OEM parts.


I could see that, the IS-F was a niche car, and niche cars often have higher priced parts.  The OEM rotors seem to go for $80- $170 at retail alone. With markup I would expect the price to possibly be upwards of $200 per rotor, add another $200-$300 for pads (they are pricey from what I been able to gather),  a couple hours of labor and you’re there.the way shop approaches the “turning” will affect both costs and quality
I’ve seen a shop doing on-the-vehicle-turning using a specialized/portable lathe
I would imagine the resulting surface will have virtually no deviations as the unevenness of how rotor is attached to the hub is already “counted it” this way, and surface is close to mirror in the end, so I would not expect any problems bedding in the padsThere’s nothing wrong at all with machining rotors as long as the minimum thickness is not exceeded and as long as the final few passes on the brake lathe are done slowly. I have seen a few guys never use a slow cut and make the final pass or two on the highest speed the lathe will run at. That gives a poor finish and should be avoided. There’s also the issue of whether or not the tech is keeping a  sharp bit in the lathe as that can make a huge difference in surface finish.
Just my experience but it seems most rotors only have about .030 to play with when it comes to cutting them.
The rotors on my Lincoln have over twice that and those much beefier rotors are likely the reason there are no issues with them. At near 300k miles on the original rotors they have never needed to be turned nor do they show any run out or parallelism issues.When a set of rotors is within a few dollars of machining the old ones why bother machining I say. But when replacement is more than double the cost of machining and the old rotors will be within spec after cleaning them up I go for that option and for years I had a brake lathe that used abrasive discs that resurfaced the friction surface of rotors and left a ‘better than original’ mating surface while removing less metal than cutting them.The #1 enemy of rotors is heat. If the original rotor is substantially heavier than an aftermarket replacement, it is better to turn. That being said, I usually don’t use high end rotors and would be a waste of time to turn the ones I use.As always there is a great deal of professional discretion available in determining the “best” solution to repairing and maintaining automobiles and we each must take our best shot based on past experience @tcmichnorth. And yes, the OE rotors are often up to resurfacing while many after markets aren’t.  And when in doubt erring to the side of caution is worthwhile. Comebacks are a great deal more costly than minor customer annoyance of the price.It’s true that carmakers don’t make their own rotors. They do usually spec a higher quality part than much of what’s available on the aftermarket. For that reason, it makes sense to keep the OEM ones as long as they are OK, and if they can be machined with good workmanship, do that. If and when they are too thin, or warped, it’s time for new ones.
I have found good results at a reasonable price with whatever rotors the people at NAPA say they use themselves, and poor results with some other aftermarket rotors. If money is no object and you want certainty,  buy the OEM rotors from a dealer.",,,,
164,Headrest- Is it safe to hang items from your headrests?,General Discussion,24,929,"Greetings and Salutations!
I just recently got a 2020 Subaru Forester, and unlike my poor Ford Escape, I have made a vow that this is the vehicle that I will keep neat!  Unfortunately, a month in, and between the receipts and the tissues and the napkins, my vow is standing on shaky ground.  Thus started the search for waste bins for vehicles.  What I am seeing is that several of them hang from headrests. Another method that I am seeing are hooks that you connect to your headrests, and then  you hang the waste bin off the hooks (or your purse, or your grocery bags…things with weight.  SIGNIFICANT weight).  All of these have my father’s voice in the back of my brain screaming, “Never hang anything from your headrests!  It will damage the safety that they provide!” So, the question then becomes, after seeing all of the products, and trying search of the internet is if my dad is right…or if companies out there trying to make a fast buck have the right idea?  If it is both, then which item is the best compromise-the hooks or the bags just hanging from the headrests?  Which item is also safest for your seats themselves?
Then the other place I am seeing the waste bins are looped over the stick shift.  This is all well and good, but then…how do you stop the cloth from rubbing back and forth, and not damaging the leather along the side?  I don’t want to damage my car! That is part of the reason why I want the silly waste bin in the first place!
I know folks are going to say, “Just clean up after every trip.”  However when you are driving errands all over the place, and have a drippy nose due to allergies or a cold, or end up doing a fast clean out of your purse, it is nice to just stick those tissues and other items in one place instead of the car floor!
Please help out!  I want to keep my headrests and vehicle SAFE, while still looking nice!
Thank you!Why do you want a waste bin in your car? To haul around waste? U get in/out of car daily? Take the waste with you.


 Cavell:

Take the waste with you.


But where do you put those 15 used tissues you used before you get to the next stop ?


 cdsky3_172256:

Then the other place I am seeing the waste bins are looped over the stick shift.


I would definitely NOT use this type. I wouldn’t want extra weight pulling on the shifter. Why not get a small wicker or plastic trashcan and use a shopping bag as a liner and leave it on the passenger floor area?


 cdsky3_172256:

hooks that you connect to your headrests


The devices to which you refer are head restraints, NOT headrests.
A headrest is a comfort-related feature for your home, while head restraints are very important safety-related devices in your car.
That being said, about a year ago, I saw a few late-night TV ads for a simple hook device to hang one’s cap from the side of the seat, and I thought that this might be a good idea.    However, the ads quickly disappeared, and there no longer seems to be any evidence of this product, so I am assuming that concerns over either head restraint integrity or side airbag deployment led to its demise.@cdsky3_172256  Just go  the only shopping place left in the Universe ( Amazon ) - Put ( vehicle trash can ) in the search box.Something like this seems least likely to cause any damage:

I agree with the comment above not to put any weight on the shifter.I use a spent plastic shopping bag. Some cars have a hook on the side of the center console to hold it. Our 2019 Odyssey does.I would say it is no big deal as long as no one is sitting there, and it won’t swing around and hit you in an incident.  When I was waxing and putting winter mats in the car the wife drives, I noticed she has a bag of face masks hanging from the head “restraint”.  It’s on the back of the seat though.  Don’t know why though, she hasn’t left the house hardly in 7 months.I would be ok with hanging a bag from the head rest or whatever it is called. Thanks for not littering.As someone who also has experienced  loved one leaving “stuff”  a all over God’s creation for 40 years I’d suggest a compromise
The center console seems to be the place, accessible to all,   where all the “gifts” ended up and was an easy “suck and vac” clean up,
No trash bags, no litter, and most important no divorce attorney fees.I have a 2019 forester. My previous was a 2002 forester. Ok your dad is correct. If you have to stop extremely fast any items hanging anywhere in the car become unsafe missiles that can strike you or another passenger/child at a high rate of speed and as you know it doesn’t take much for an object with just a little bit of weight at high speed to cause serious injury or death…,let alone a 20lb purse! You know those recyclable plastic bags you get from the grocery store make excellent trash bags for cars AND you can hook a handle over the shift knob and never have to worry about any damage to the leather of the seat/center console because it will never do any damage to the leather. Plus you can reuse it several times before it becomes damaged enough to replace it. I use those and let the bag sit in the passenger foot well so its pretty much out of the way of anyone and it’s within reach of the driver(me) and anyone who needs. I also took 2 clothes hanger clips and clipped 1 on the back of the passenger seat to the outside of the cargo pocket. This puts them both where needed AND keeps them out of the way of everyone plus low enough that in case of an emergency stop or god forbid the event of a collision they aren’t going to go flying with whatever weight they may have and injure anyone. Just make a schedule in your head every time its time for you to take all the garbage out to be picked up the next day take the few seconds and empty them out into your bin as most people have to roll the bin passed the car to take it out anyway.easy simple solution. Oh and make 1 more rule. Never eat food in the car. You don’t want the smell of old food in the car and you definitely do not want the car to become a rat/mouse/bug house either.I have first hand knowledge that if a rodent smells the food they WILL ATTEMPT to find a way to get to the food!! And you will never ever get the smell of a dead mouse who got stuck in a heating vent out of the car. It literally will forever smell like that so bad you won’t drive that car anymore. As an auto technician I have literally seen insurance companies total out a perfectly good but smelly car just due to the smell. And think like this…that smell carries diseases that can kill you if you are exposed to it long enough. Thats why dead animals and such are considered biohazards. If that critter was carrying any disease that could infect a human you’ll get it because if you are smelling it you are inhaling those diseases as they are evacuating the corpse. Thats how the black death plague that wiped out over half of the entire human population got started. Humans were not clean and were in too close a contact with the rats that got sick with it and died. It mutated from the strain that was killing rats into the strain that killed people. Diseases do that by becoming exposed to a new host and changes to be able to use that host as well.any way enough of my rambling. I hope my solutions to your question has given you an idea or 2 of your own. Good luck and stay safe.Do an online search for “car floor trash bin” and you will find quite a few options.
I have a smaller version of a bin like this:

The one I have has lasted almost 50 years use through four cars so far.  This style with flaps and nobby textured bottom of the bin and flaps fits nicely over the floor hump in rear wheel drive vehicles and equally well on the flat floor of front wheel drive vehicles and stays nicely in place without sliding around.
If you have a vehicle with a center console, set the bin in the middle of the rear floor such you can reach back between the front bucket seats to deposit used tissues, etc. by feel without having to take your eyes off the road.
It is easy to put small trash items in, is leak proof, and easily washes out.  And it’s easy to empty to keep the car clean and tidy.
(Wrath and woe to anyone who throws trash on my car’s seats or floor or stuffs trash in the door bins or console!!!)Please don’t eat in your car. It’s disgusting.I am not going to read a wall of text will out breaks and paragraphs .Since you asked, I carry around a few 3-5 lb. dumbbells so I can get exercise while driving and when waiting at lights.  The passengers head restraint is a convenient place to hang them and you can make your own hooks from wire coat hangers…   If concerned about safety, just don’t plan on having an accident.  Same argument goes for not buying insurance.

Seriously ?  Those are so old and finding one in decent shape would be almost impossible .

Check out a used Corolla, Civic , Sentra etc.  Pay a mechanic to inspect it before you buy any used carHe wants a new car that looks like an Omni. Or hot hatch. Most new cars look like jellybeans.


 vanonimotors_172776:

Yes. Those cars are way too old. I suggest you go for something more modern. The Golf is the newer generation Rabbit. The newer cars are safer and need maintenance less frequently. How much money do you want to spend?  That will help us with suggestions for you to look at. It seems that you like small hatchbacks. Auto or manual transmission?  Any other features you like?

Am I going in the complete wrong direction?


yup
your first car should be a common-as-dirt sedan from the last few years
That rules out ALL european carsEven here in Arizona, where cars don’t rust, I have not seen an Omni/Horizon in many years.  Even in junkyards.  In fact, even during my high school years, which were 1993-1997, the Omni and Horizon were not very common.  The most common cars at that time were the Shadow/Sundance, Spirit/Acclaim, and Cavalier/Sunbird.
I don’t know how old you are, but I just turned 40 this year, and I would love to have a classic Shadow/Sundance or Spirit/Acclaim.  They were everywhere, and now in the blink of an eye, they’re mostly gone.  Maybe I see one 2-3 times a year.I worked with a couple who had good luck with a 1983 Rabbit cabrio as a daily driver but keep in mind that they bought it after it had been gone through by a previous owner. And my co-worker could fix anything on that car himself. Finding a decent example of either would be tough so i’d suggest looking at the newest VW golf that fit’s the budget and getting a service manual for it.
My brother had a 86 Jetta as a college beater back in the early 2000’s but he could work on it himself. Ended up finding the german specialist he still uses to help track down what turned out to be a couple easy fixes that took the shop 30sec to figure out. He won’t buy a car that they wouldn’t work on.Junk when they were brand new.Back in 1962 when I was replacing my first car, a 1947 Pontiac, a mechanic friend recommended as a used car, I should stick with Ford or Chevrolet.  Mechanics were familiar with them and parts were readily available.  I bought a 1955 Pontiac.  I should have listened to my mechanic friend.  Back then, each division of GM had its own engine.  The Pontiac V8 was new in 1955 and the engine gave me a lot of trouble. Today, I think my mechanic friend would recommend buying a Toyota Corolla or Honda Civic for the same reason.

Those are so old and finding one in decent shape would be almost impossible . Plus parts are going to be a problem because they are not collector items.

Again, +1
A cheap vehicle that was unreliable when it was new certainly didn’t become reliable (or durable) after the passage of more than 3 decades. Vehicles that were cheap when purchased are the ones that typically receive the worst maintenance, or no maintenance at all.   Hence the total absence of these cars on the roads nowadays.
We don’t know any details about the OP’s budget, but if he has sufficient funds he would probably be best-off looking for a well-maintained Japanese or American or Korean car that is no more than 8 years old.I actually have a soft spot for one version of the Omni - the Shelby GLH, which stood for “Goes Like Hell.”  Fantastic little sleeper.
However, that little sleeper is old enough to run for president, and nothing sucks more than a first car that you can’t ever drive because it’s always being worked on.
Get something newer.

166,Loud hum at highway speed in my 2006 CR-V,Maintenance/Repairs,4,178,"I hear a loud hum from the front end of my CR=V starting at around 60 MPH. It sounds like it is coming from under the dashboard or around the window. My mechanic drove it and could hear it (it can get pretty loud) but could not find the problem, It was intermittent but has become more frequent.Does it change on a curve or with a twitch of the steering wheel?I have not been able to tie it to any specific thing except speed. I almost sounds like something is loose and vibrating. At first I though it must be something under the dash.You need to find a mechanic who has invested in modern technology, such as Chassis Ears.
None of us can hear it or experience it via cyberspace, but a good mechanic with the right equipment should be able to track-down the source of the hum fairly quickly.

Have 1+ amp solar panel glued to trunk attached to battery.  (Same panel model keeps my boat battery charged, but not car.)  Computer draw is less than 1/4 amp. How do I return to my car without needing a jump?A quarter of an amp is way too much draw when off.  50 milliamperes, (0.05 amps). yours is drawing 0.25 amps.
Most vehicles draw some battery current when the key is off , thanks to the clock and the internal memory of engine computers, body-control modules, and radio presets. Altogether, they draw a very small amount of current . Fifty milliamps would be a safe upper limit for this, though many vehicles will draw less.
Your solar panel only produces power during periods of sunlight.  I think it can not keep up with the excess power drain.Indeed, the 250 milliamp draw is excessive so you are going to have to track down the source of the problem. Once that problem is eliminated I think your solar panel will do fine to keep a charge up on the battery. Here is a link you can refer to that will help you find the problem.

At the end of acceleration the car jerks when the rpm’s drop.  It feels like the belt is slipping, does this require a full transmission swap?Not neccesarily. Take it to an independent transmission shop and have someone put their hands, computers and tools ON the car. Far, far better answer than you’ll get from people in the internet who can’t see, touch or feel the car.

 Mustangman:

+1
Whether one is talking about a CVT or a conventional automatic transmission, 140k is around the point where many of them fail if their fluid has never been changed.
Has the OP changed the trans fluid at least 4 times so far?
If the answer is “no”, then I concur that there is likely to be some bad news from the trans shop.CVT’s will jerk when the clutch pack in the torque converter locks up.  It is supposed to lock up just after the vehicle gets moving when low speed and low RPM minimize this.  It sounds like yours is not locking up until you’ve stopped accelerating and that could be either a programming issue or defective valve.
Subaru has had an issue with one of the lockup valves in its CVTs, but the repair requires a valve body replacement, and that is cheaper than a whole transmission.  It might just need a reprogramming.  I’d take it to the dealer and invest in a diagnostic, it could save you money in the long run.",,,,
170,Mazda 5; 0w-30 instead of 0w-20?,Maintenance/Repairs,7,362,"Hello,
I was changing the oil in Mazda 5 this morning and noticed, as I was pouring it in, that I bought 0w-30 instead of 0w-20 which is called for in the owner’s manual.
Should I drain it and put in the specified oil weight or is it close enough?


 marlatt42:

Should I drain it and put in the specified oil weight


Yes!
TesterYou car will do just fine with 0w-30. It is just slightly thicker at operating temperature than 0w-20.
If you were to look in the Owner’s Manual for this car with the same engine sold in other countries you’d find that a range of oil weights (another description of thickness or viscosity) are acceptable, depending on ambient temperature.
In the US, car makers are driven to recommend the thinnest oil that can give acceptable protection against wear, not optimal protection.
Why? Because of government mandates to increase fuel economy.
Engines turn more freely with thinner oil.
You might get a fraction of one fewer MPG with the 0w-30 oil, hardly worth the trouble of another oil change.
To those that claim the engine may not work properly with the slightly thicker oil, I ask how does the engine withstand a cold start when 0w-20 oil at 70F is thicker than 20w-50 oil at 180F?

Oil Viscosity | MotorWeek 17

 circuitsmith:

You car will do just fine with 0w-30.


Maybe. If the engine has variable valve timing, that can make the oil spec more critical than it would otherwise be. If there’s trouble with a VVT system, the first questions should be about the quantity and qualities of the oil.
Another reason to prefer the 0W20 over the 0W30 is its narrower range. That means more lubricity and less viscosity enhancer. Is that a meaningful difference? I don’t know.
How many times in the next six months will you worry about the characteristics of your oil?Can you detect a vvt issue when using wrong oil weight?


 circuitsmith:

You car will do just fine with 0w-30. It is just slightly thicker at operating temperature than 0w-20.


Correct…and at operating temps the 0W-30 is still thinner then 0W-20 when it’s cold.
I actually switched to 0W-30 from 0W-20 on my highlander over a year go. My wife’s 07 Lexus (with same engine as my 14 Highlander) oil recommendation is 5W-30. I switched it over to 0W-30 also. That way I only need to buy one type of oil.Different weight oil can be used when outside the jurisdiction of the EPA, this is from the 2015 Mazda owners manual;
“(Mexico)
Use SAE 0W-20 engine oil. If SAE 0W-20 engine oil is not available, use SAE 5W-20, 5W-30 engine oil”

Is there a sensor that on the verge of failing works fine when cold but would malfunction ONLY when the car reaches operating temperature?
The computer shows no codes at all…Yes, crankshaft postion sensor, camshaft position sensor, some ignition modules will do this… not a sensor… don’t know which car you have so I can’t know of you have any of these.
There are other parts that can act like this as well. I won’t go into them unless you give lots of details about your car and problem.Crankshaft position sensor.Its a 2011 Camry 2.5L L4 6 speed automatic, 4 cylinders.
The car drives fine when cold… then at operating temperature its starts vibrating/hesitating when throttled to accelerate. Between 1500rpm to 2000rpm it vibrates when you put your foot on the “gas” pedal. Above 50mph it drives totaly smooth. It just acts up when the car reaches operating temperature. Thought it might be some kind of sensor…
This problem does not happen in Park or Neutral. Only in Drive.
the computer shows no codes at all. its a mystery bug.Harmonic damper?
Shot in the dark.Argos , why not just go ahead and find a good rated shop and have this thing diagnosed ?  You have several threads about it so just tell them to have you approve any repairs they want to do .
Just replacing parts from web guesses might not solve anything . You might even find a shop that will waive the diagnostic fee if they get to do the work.Thank you. I will do that eventually. Promise. I’m just trying to gather as much information about this as possible. Sorry for repeating this issue on the forum. Not trying to spam you guys.When the engine is cold it is operating on Open Loop and based on pre-set parameters in the computer.  Once it warms up it switched to Closed Loop using readings from the various sensors.  So really the only way to identify it is to put the diagnostic equipment on it and see which readings are out of wack.  There may not be a code until it gets far worse or related to something that won’t give a code.Thanks, Bing! I really preciate it. I found a well rated shop on Angies List. They probably have all the gear to pin down this problem. I’d probably have to leave it for a day so they can really test the hell out of it.There are at least 12 engine sensors, there are some sensors that could cause a hesitation when failing, how long does the hesitation last?
Get that vibration checked out, could be torque convertor shudder.@Nevada_545 The vibration feels like a short burst. I watch the RPM needle and it shakes up and down a little bit, then once the vibration is done, the needle jumps upward and you can hear the motor reving with the needle. Its like… the needle releases upward and you hear a faster vrooooom at the same time.It sounds like you have a misfire, but it might not be misfiring enough to reach the threshold for setting a misfire code.  To isolate a cylinder for this, you would need a higher end diagnostic tool that can view the misfire registers in real time.  These can be had for around $200.
I do think that the issue only happens when you go closed loop so even a cheap code reader will usually provide STFT and LTFT (short term and long term fuel trim).  It may be approaching the limits.
You also might need a valve adjustment.  If your valve lash has never been checked, it might be a good investment.  Check your owners manual to see if the valve lash check is part of the maintenance schedule and if it is overdue, it should be done even if it doesn’t solve your problem.  This maintenance requires a new valve cover gasket set so it is not a cheap item.",,,,

 mio.da.bomb_157143:

A crankshaft kit (crankshaft and bearings) is $180 from O’Reilly auto parts. You will need to thoroughly clean the debris from the block,  inspect the block main journals and check the connecting rods for damage/out of round.



 mio.da.bomb_157143:

My bigger question is should I just bite the bullet and give up and give the engine to a shop.


Yes, or buy a crate engine.As much as I’d want you to learn on this one, it may be time to replace it.  Who knows where all the damage is?  You could have problems all over the place, not just the crank and bearings.


 mio.da.bomb_157143:

This time I do believe it’s rod knock because I took off the oil pan and there was metal dust and a few little bit larger pieces about the size of sand.


Put back the oil pan and fill the engine with fresh oil. Hopefully the noise will be gone and you could go on with your life. Worst scenario is that the engine knocks again.I would drive or tow it directly to the junkyard.I’m going to take a different stand. I do agree this could be a big project…but it’s also a great learning experience.
I’d disassemble the block…send it to a machine shop to assess. I’ve dealt with machine shops that sell all the parts you need to rebuild an engine. You might need some help…but it could be fun.
The only caveat is cost. This could be a money pit. How much is it worth.


 COROLLAGUY1:

Engines don’t heal, they must be repaired.I looked at MIO’s other threads and I think his parents are correct that this is beyond his current ability .  Plus the fact that it appears he does not have the funds to even finish it if he starts this project.A rebuilt 350 block with head (long block) can be had for about $1600 from almost anywhere. You might find one cheaper local to you. They are ready for you to swap over your manifolds, headers, starters, water pump, basically all accessories, drop in and go. With a warranty.  Don’t know if that breaks your budget, but it cold be cheaper in the long run.I don’t mean this in a mean spirited way so don’t take it as such. Due to your age and inexperience i think you are asking for trouble by doing this yourself and could easily end up with a lot of lost money. There are many inspections and procedures that must be done and many of those are not even listed in service manuals.
A remanufactured or crate engine could easily be the better and more inexpensive way out.
For what it’s worth I did a rebuild on a Ford 5.0 some years ago and used Federal Mogul main bearings. During the setup; I discovered that the thrust main bearing is hour glassed in shape by .005 of an inch. That leads to the question of what is the correct crankshaft end play? Too tight or too loose depending upon whether you base that measurement on the ends of the bearing or the center. Three sets of bearings were like this.
Several calls to Federal Mogul and their engineering department called me back. They had no idea nor would they make a suggestion as to which way to handle this. I chose to go tight and let the shell ends wear off until the thrust surfaces were flat. So far it’s fine but I loathe doing something like this and it bugs me to no end that the engineers at FM were not aware of this or had any idea as to how to resolve it.
They suggested another set of bearings until I told them that was the 3rd set in a row made like this and that I had even taken a micrometer into the parts store and showed them the problem.
See what I mean about the unexpected and things not found in a manual?I am going to go against the grain here.  All of the options which have been discussed on this thread require pulling the motor from the car.  If you’re going to do that, why not attempt a DIY repair?  As long as you do not remove the pistons from the cylinder bores, replacing the crankshaft and bearings is not difficult, and you can purchase a crankshaft kit which includes all of the bearings so all the measurement is done for you.
Insofar as cleaning, most of the metal shavings will be caught in the oil pump pickup screen and possibly inside the lubricating passage of the crankshaft.  It should be possible to clean or replace the oil pump pickup tube, and any debris inside the crankshaft will not matter since it’s being replaced.  Carburetor cleaner, lint-free paper towels, and compressed air can be used to clean engine parts.
To be honest, before going through the effort to pull the motor, I might even take apart the connecting rods from below and see if the crankshaft journals are visibly damaged to the point that new bearing inserts aren’t an option.  If it’s only been driven a short distance while making noise, maybe the defective bearing(s) have not worn down to the steel backing, and the mating journal surface is still ok.  You will need to raise the vehicle high enough to lay on your back underneath and have room to apply the necessary torque.  The safest way to do this without a shop lift is to use a floor jack to lift each corner one at a time, and place a steel wheel made for a truck–laying on its side–under each tire.Not that I know anything about it but back in my youth I knew a couple guys that spent a cold winter night outside under their cars with a trouble light, putting new bearings in.  I assumed this was an emergency procedure and have no idea of the long term success.  Still for a set of bearings and some plastic gauge, one might ask what is to lose?  I sure wouldn’t recommend doing an overhaul though or pulling the engine.bearing replacement will be only a temporary stop-gap measure
it’s for sure that crankshaft will be found to have some wear, if not a visible damage
pulling the engine and getting replacement crankshaft and bearings may be a better solution in longer-term, but one has to assess the overall condition of other subsystems… it may be that for the lasting repair the parts to be replaced will “cascade”, where you go deeper you discover more and more things to address. a crate/short-block may be a better option in the end

So many of us who are replying started out the same way as you, which was young, inexperienced, but with ambition.
I tackled my first engine project at the age of 18, and am so glad I did.  Sure I made mistakes, but that is how I learned.
I do strongly suggest finding a mentor who can help answer questions and guide you.  He or she will very likely enjoy the “giving back”.

I also had a history of making my own first rebuild when I was 19 or so, on my father’s car, which was in quite a bad shape at the moment and it was a great learning experience, even having book and nothing else as a mentor.
It’s not a rocket science in the end The small block Chevy is likely the most common engine found. Ive seen them in everything from Jeeps to Datsun to a shopping cart once at a drag race.
Assuming its pre-fuel injection its about as simple and forgiving as an engine can get.   It’s also the cheapest to buy parts for and no piece is rare or hard to find. If you ever wanted to rebuild one then go for it. If you get it took apart and the block is ruined its still the easiest engine to find used. Finding a used one in any old car/truck/ school bus/ dump truck… is not  hard.  Plus if you build up a nice engine and the rest of the vehicle is junked you can move it to most any general motors product.  (and a lot of non gm vehicles have adapters too)

176,Oil companies using food waste to make diesel,Power/Fuel,16,460,"I just read an article in the NY Times (I’ll spare the URI out of deference to the delicate sensibilities of some forum participants.) about oil companies collecting waste food grease, processing it into regular diesel, identical to the dead-bacteria kind (put it that way, it doesn’t sound so hard).  They collect it in the dead of night because there’s less traffic.  That reminded me of an article in the LA Times years ago about the Mob taking over the used grease business.  Companies process it so it can be used again (think about that over your next french fry).  The fast food joints have large tanks out back.  They weren’t locked up; anybody could take it, so the Mob moved in.
That reminds me of the time newsprint got so expensive people (not the Mob, just amateurs) followed around the trucks that delivered the free papers, took the whole stack for recycling.

Sounds like trespassing and theft. In 2008 I had co-workers that believed they could collect all of the waste cooking oil they wanted after midnight.A few weeks ago I was driving in an area of no fast food restaurants and kept smelling hamburgers.  I’m guessing I was driving along in the vicinity of a diesel vehicle that was burning said food grease diesel.Seems to still be mostly smaller local firms around here, but it makes sense that the oil companies would want a piece of the action. One local VW owner had a Biodiesel badge made up for the car.Bio diesel from cooking oil is nearly as old as the diesel engine itself. I had a coworker who tried running just filtered oil in his Chevy diesel truck. After 2 rebuilds of his injection pump he stopped. Somehow this PhD candidate missed the step of using methanol to remove the fats that clog up pumps

How old is this article? About 20 years ago the bio-diesel craze was going wild in some areas. Many diy’rs were creating bio-diesel. They go around to the fast food markets to collect the old grease. Theses places were happy to get rid of it…but then the market got a lot bigger…then these fast food places started selling it.Personally, I put converting grease into biodiesel myself in the same category as reloading bullets or brewing my own beer.
It’s so much easier, cheaper, safer, and requires less of my time to just buy it somewhere.
To each his own, though.

There is (was) a guy in my neighborhood that did the biodiesel thing. I think the most annoying part of it is paying fuel taxes on your recycled vegetable oil.
A friend  at work reloads his shells. He does it because he is a small guy and wants a softer recoil on his rifle while he’s hunting.
I know several people that brew their own beer. A program manager I work with brews several different beers and never buys any. He does it to get what he likes every time. He’s a self-admitted beer snob.  His beers are excellent.

Oil refineries see profit in turning kitchen grease into diesel - Albany Business Review (bizjournals.com) 3Having spent a few years behind a fryer, no way would I steal that stuff to use again for food.  We’d change grease about every 30 days and it was pretty bad by then.The county school bus fleet has been using 15% biodiesel/diesel mix for at least 10 years, the commercial use/production of biodiesel fuel has been going on for years. The low % mix is a safer use of biodiesel, diesel fuel system parts are expensive to replace.States tax fuel as a way to make vehicle operators pay for the wear they put on roads in proportion to how much they drive.  Why wouldn’t they want to charge road tax on biodiesel?  So far they don’t charge road tax on electric cars, but that’s a political choice to encourage them, and when there are a lot more there will have to be some way to make them pay.Depends on the state, Here in Washington you pay $225 (if i remember correctly) as a tax when you renew your registration on an EV. $75 for a hybrid.

Almost all recycled restaurant cooking oil is used as a biofuel base stock. It doesn’t appear that any goes into cooking oil again. Well, organized crime might cut virgin cooking oil with the garbage oil, but it would still have to be processed to remove solids and water if they expected to sell it to restaurants.

If you can get past the 50 pages of how to operate the sound system


One of my cars from years ago (either my '86 Taurus or my '92 Accord) had 20 pages explaining how to use your seatbelts.
My current vehicle (2011 Outback) has a separate manual devoted to the sound system, GPS, Bluetooth, and backup camera.  That manual–which was clearly translated (badly) from a different language–is actually thicker than the manual for everything else.People still drank battery acid 50 years ago. But they just, you know, died. Or at least didn’t try to sue the battery manufacturer.
And to any commentary about the ‘dumbness’ of today’s generation, @VDCdriver’s statement above about seatbelts illustrates the fallacy here. Even 20 years ago, it was still only 10 years or so removed from when many places started requiring people to buckle up. Let alone OEMs prior to the 70s thinking that there was no issue with putting someone behind the wheel of a multi-ton piece of machinery capable of 100+ mph, with no means of protection in case it suddenly stopped. You want to talk about dumb…

Mea Culpa I think maintaining vehicles today are a lot easier then they were 40 years…considerably easier.
. Most vehicles these days don’t have adjustable valves.
. Don’t have to worry about points/condenser.
. No Zerks to worry about.
Somethings are more difficult on a modern vehicle…tranny fluid exchange…rear spark plugs on a transverly mounted engine. But overall I think cars these days are easier to maintain.
But the part of the equation is not just PM or repairs. From my experience todays vehicles see far fewer repairs. They are so much more reliable today.I worked with computers for 25 years, parts become obsolete and that scares me the most. But that happens with old stuff also. Working on my 65 boat engine parked at the cabins 500 miles away, dual points if I recall correctly was having issues and decided to go to the parts stores in the 80’s to get a dwell meter to make sure things were right, as my dwell meter was at home. Parts stor counter guy was like a what? Let me ask an old timer. He comes out and says we have not sold those in years. So we fry a circuit board or something in the future, I fear they will not be available.

I was cleaning up my cellar over a month ago and ran across my timing light and dwell meter…I’m keeping them for nostalgia. About 9 years ago I was rebuilding a carb for a friend of my son’s. Went to Autozone (open on Sunday) to get a rebuild kit. They had one. I asked the parts counter guy if it came with a float…he looked at me like deer in headlights.If I had a vintage engine with points ignition, that is the very first thing I’d change. Replacement electronic triggers are far, far more reliable than points and cheap enough to keep a second set on-hand if needed.
I understand carbs. I can rebuild them easily. But I’d strongly consider replacing the entire fuel system with throttle body fuel injection on any vintage car just for the drive-ability. No vapor lock, no chokes, no stuck floats and complete compatibility with E10 fuel.
Same for front drum brakes… they are going straight into the bin to make way for disk brakes.
I’ll never own a too-valuable-to-modify vintage car so I don’t give a rat’s hiney about originality, I want to drive it.

Sounds exactly what I’d do. Retro-mod.Today we can afford to pay for maintenance and infrequent repairs better than our parents could. This in addition to today’s cars needing less of both.I’ve still got my dwell meter in the original carton and I’m keeping it just to confuse the grandkids and in case I ever win a 57 Thunderbird.A friend tells this story:  she had a teenage boy riding in the passenger seat.  She asked him to close his window. She watched him, and saw that he didn’t know how to do…because it had a crank, no buttons!
For a bit of seriousness:  the skills I learned in keeping my cars on the road starting in the 1950’s have carried me through life, helped frame my career and saved me tons of money.  And my children still laugh at my challenges with computers and smartphones.  Maybe I have gotten dumber.When  my city started recycling electronics at the waste center ~15 years ago my dwell meter went in one of the big boxes I took there.
I still have the Eico VTVM I built from a kit in Jr HS in 1973.
I use it sometimes when working on vintage tube gear. It’s indestructible.
With a little math a decent o’scope can function as a dwell meter.It takes older people longer than young people to learn stuff. We marvel at how our 2 year old grandson manipulates has phone. Yes, he has a smartphone. It’s Daddy’s old phone, and doesn’t have a cell phone plan. It still uses WiFi though, and he summons You Tube to watch his kiddie videos. When it doesn’t work the way he likes, Krakatoa blows his little top. Wow, does he go ballistic. Hey, I said he’s two.Could not afford an oscilloscope. I think it would take a lot of math. Kind of like in the new world of surveying.
The laser and Total station were not working and still having problems with GPS supposedly cm precision after correction. So I said grab a rod and the level we will get the info. The rod is an extendable pole measured off in .10 inches. The level is like a telescope. You start with 2 known points, an occupied and backsite, ie 2 property corners. Then measure angle, and the top hair in the level minus the bottom hair in the the level reading the rod times 200 gives you distance in feet. Elevation difference from the occupied point could then be determined, from a run to a known elevation, cross hatch on a hydrant bolt or 1/4 section marker etc.  Survey was accurate as needed, who could even find a rod a level and know what to do with it these days.",,,,

Allowing the oil level to get real low is a contributor to the oil consumption problem for several reasons.


 Emmanuel23:

It’s good that you frequently check oil level. Now be sure to keep it topped up. You can record how much oil it needs to stay topped up between oil changes - but the important thing is to prevent it from getting more than one quart down from full.
Many engines can go for years even if they burn oil - as long as they don’t get too low on oil.

Depends on the condition of the rest of the vehicle and if the owner wants to spend the money on it  .

Somehow, talking about “rocketing over the highway” in a vehicle with a top speed (if anyone dared  )
of 55 mph is pretty bizarre, IMHO.Don’t forget the Daf. And there was a similar Fiat. A dealer in Cinncinnati gave me the Fiat for a couple of hours while waiting for them to replace the V8 valve rockers in my  new 55 Cheve.4.2 BHP !  One of the pictures shows what I think is a “break” (as they said in the ad) dragging on the ground.  With those brakes you might have had to drag your foot on the ground!I remember the DAF.  I saw one at the NY auto show in the late 1950s or early 60s and was intrigued by the continuously variable transmission that I think was unique in passenger cars then.  It was small and I believe it was Dutch.  I’m trying to remember other things that intrigued me but they are not coming back.  I think I tried to interest my Dad in one to use to go to the train station.If I remember right, that Peel had no reverse gear. You had to pick it up by the front bumper and spin it around.

I’ve never done this before… I’m not a mechanic.
I suspected a head gasket leak being the cause of an overheat. I didn’t let it get hotter than 95% of the white range on the temp gauge but it never got to full red. (a narrow band at the top). Car ran fine the whole time except that when it got the hottest, I did smell something overheated (plastic?).  In any case, I took the head off and found what appears to be a blown head gasket. The port-side piston (#1?) has more oil gunk on it. I didn’t see any ‘mayonaise’ anywhere… just charred oil.  Besides the overheating, the only other clue was slight bubbling from the radiator and a slightly dirty coolant overflight reservoir interior.  Oil all looked good.
I found a few areas of the head where I could slide a .0015 in / .038 mm feeler while using an expensive straightedge. In a few areas, Iwas able to PARTIALLY slide .002in/.051mm feeler but never all the way through to the other side of the straightedge. Does the head need resurfacing?
Also, the 4 pistons appear to have dents only at the sides farthest from the front of the car. The dents appear to be aligned with the valves, but I’m not sure. Is this bad? Could I have caused this by cranking it by hand clockwise a few degrees? (I might have bumped it a few degrees the wrong way) I moved it counterclockwise trying to find TDC.

Those “dents” are valve relief cuts, which are supposed to be there.  Also, any time you pull the head for any reason, you have it checked and resurfaced by a professional machine shop, or you replace it.  The last time I did this procedure on an engine which had overheated, I purchased a used head from a “you pull it” junkyard and had a machine shop install new valve stem seals, polish the valves and valve seats, and resurface the mating surface.  I paid about $350 for the machine shop work.Yep they machine the head to make it flat and magna flux it to check for cracks.  I’m not a mechanic either but paid for one.Good news on the head then.  The head is being resurfaced tomorrow.
How should I clean the pistons of all that carbon?  There’s some gritty material in there.


 DrakkhenByte:

Use nothing more abrasive than a quality paper towel (e.g. Bounty or better yet, Scott’s Shop Towels) soaked with carburetor cleaner.  Do not attempt to use any sandpaper, sandcloth, scouring brush, etc.  That would result in abrasive material getting down into the piston rings and chewing up the cylinder walls.  Also, this is an open-deck aluminum engine block–there is not much material to seal the perimeter of each cylinder from the water jacket, so even small scratches in that area can cause a leak.I think that you should have run a dry/wet compression test before disassembly. Overheating will have an effect on cylinder walls, piston ring seizures, or rings losing their temper. That does not mean an irate emotional state; just that they can lose their spring tension and not seat properly.
With that much carbon buildup on the piston tops it does make one wonder if oil is getting past the rings. The horses left the barn now but if it were me first thing I’d do once back together is run a dry/wet compression test just to get an idea if there is ring trouble brewing.
Just an FYI, but anytime a head has less than .002 of warp it can be reused. The head bolts will flatten it back out although surfacing will certainly not hurt. And anytime I’ve done a head gasket job it always gets a new thermostat unless it’'s proven that it was replaced just last week.I would advise checking for valve leaks before installing the head. Or better yet have the shop do a complete valve job after machining it.Could the oil have burned on the pistons from some other source other than ring leaks?Well, the head shop said that the any warpage is below tolerances for resurfacing the head.  He told me just to clean everything with soapy water.  He said it just needs a new head gasket.  I took him the head, the camshaft, valve train, and gasket and he inspected it all.  This is the same guy the local Honda dealerships use for all their work.  Do I trust his word?The carbon on the piston is normal, the dents are not. Those are not valve reliefs, those are from valve contact. The dents appear to be covered with carbon so it may have occurred in the past and repaired.
Check the valves for leaks before installing the cylinder head.Do you trust his word?  You went to him, so yes.  He’s being straight with you and not running up a bill.  You should show the machine shop guy the photos of the pistons and ask him about the relief cuts, but they sure look like they were made that way.  And you could use a shop vac and a small stiff bristle brush (NOT wire) to get out as many crumbs as you can.
I’m sure the posts that counsel you to tear things down and check the rings and so forth are technically correct, but that’s for you to decide.  To me it looks pretty normal for an engine with 115,000 miles on it and a history of a failed head gasket.  If it was me then a new timing belt kit, water pump, thermostat, radiator hoses, top end gasket set, radiator pressure cap, maybe spark plugs, gentle throttle body cleaning, new air filter, coolant, oil and filter, etc. would be on the shopping list.  Might as well do all that because you are in there now and you’ll be handling all those parts anyway.  Put it all together, button up all the loose ends, start it up and drive yourself somewhere for a cup of coffee and a well earned gloat that you did the job.This piston has valve reliefs;

182,"2009 Accord: No power, shaking, check engine light flashing",Maintenance/Repairs,4,166,"I have a 2009 Honda Accord EX four-cylinder automatic sedan with 220K miles. I am the original owner and have maintained it fairly well. It was time for some maintenance, the spark plugs haven’t been replaced since 100K and I was going to do that at my next oil change in 1K. The starter was replaced 3 months ago and a rear ball joint at 150K, catalytic converter was replaced early on under warranty. For the past 6 months or so the car had been starting hard. At first occasionally and more recently about 80-90% of the time. I asked my mechanic at my last oil change if he thought that it could be the fuel pump which was my suspicions and he said that Honda fuel pumps rarely need to be replaced and if anything it might have been a leaky gasket.
One night this past week my fuel tank was empty and I stopped to get gas. I filled it up to about a half a tank. When I got back in the car to start it it took about 10 or more seconds to turn over and finally started. When I went to leave the gas station I noticed that my acceleration seemed markedly laggy. Then the check engine light starting flashing as I drove but only when pressing on gas pedal. Then it lost almost all power and I could barely get it to go 10mph, going up a small incline I would lose what little power I had and almost come to a stop. It also was intermittently shaking, almost bucking. Then the check engine light, VSA, and triangle/exclaimation point stayed illuminated. I turned the car off and restarted it. It started up fine and no lights were on. Then I tried again to drive it and still had no power and check engine light was flashing again only when stepping on gas.
I went to my local AutoZone to rent a fuel pressure gauge. When I got it home to hook it up I found that I needed an adapter for my particular model of car to use the testing kit. But as I was depressurizing the fuel lines I thought the pressure seemed low. When I went back to AutoZone to return the kit I was talking to the associate and he said it sounded like a clogged fuel filter. When he looked up the make and model of my car he said that there is no fuel filter that it’s in the fuel pump. Impulsively I bought a new Delphi fuel pump and installed it myself. But sadly that was not it! It still has all same symptoms.
Anyone have any similar experiences or ideas what it might be?Get a code reader and tell us what codes have been set.

If you continue to drive it with the CEL flashing, you are likely to cause expensive damage to the catalytic converter and/or other expensive parts.Too late now, but when you were at Autozone the first step would have been to have your codes read.
Don’t drive it until a proper diagnosis and repair is performed.For future reference, when the check engine light is flashing it means “Shut the engine off now!” I don’t know if you’ve done any harm but you certainly haven’t done the car any good. Follow @Purebred 's advice.",,,,

185,2012 Toyota Prius - when to change the battery?,Maintenance/Repairs,5,244,"At what mileage does the Hybrid Battery and Inverter Assembly (computer system) need changed for a 2012?Basically when they wear out . Some that are used for cabs in New York City have a great deal of miles on them.  Why are you asking ?We were thinking of buying a 2012 Prius for $6000 and it has 165,000 miles. Our 2003 Prius had to have both battery and Inverter assembly replaced for about $7000. If we buy this car, how long will it be till it also needs them replaced. Which would double the price. That might not be that bad, but I am just weighing options. I asked the car agent and he said that he did not see those repairs done in the report.
Thanks for your quick response!
NancyOK , you pay 6000.00 for a 8 year used vehicle then the battery fails and you spend another 7000.00  . That makes no sense at all.  No one can predict when you will need these repairs.
Have you looked at Kelly Blue Book because I would never buy a Hybrid used with that many miles.I don’t know where you live, but if you’re really okay with spending $6k + $7k = $13k, Kelly Blue Book shows that you can get a 2014 with around 50,000 miles on it from a dealer for about that much money. There’s always a risk, but I would be inclined to go with the newer car with many fewer miles on it.The Toyota hybrid system is usually very reliable/durable. It’s fairly unusual to need to replace the inverter, and aftermarket companies can replace the battery for a reasonable price. If you have the VIN for the vehicle you can sign up on the owners section of the Toyota website and pull the full dealership maintenance history. That might give you more insight into what repairs have already been performed. Definitely a gamble with the higher mileage but not necessarily a bad purchase in my opinion.",,,,

You should have asked for that before buying the car.

Everything is fixable, just takes money. If you just deal with it, you likely will need MORE money to fix it than if you fix it right now.

I’d start saving for a new vehicle right now. This one is pretty much at the end of life and is going to cost you quite a bit of money from here on. Sorry if this seems harsh but these cars are known to be unreliable money pits. Better you should prepare for it rather than get caught short.

194,Got towed and now can’t start up,Maintenance/Repairs,2,145,"I’ve had my 97 Chevy K2500 for almost 2 months.
This morning I needed a tow, the ujoint in my rear drive shaft snowballed. I was able to start the truck no problem as I waited for help.
Got towed by a wrecker (the kind where they wench you up so your wheels are all off the ground).
He unloaded the truck at my house.
Now sitting in it calling for parts, I realize:
The truck won’t start, nothing works, no ignition and most peculiar:
There is a noise coming from around the steering column/ with  hood open it seems to come from around where cruise control box sits.
The noise sounds like when you wind up a jewelry box but instead of it playing the song it just winds.
If I hit the brake pedal or flip the light switch it stops.
with the light not coming on of course. But it comes back after a few seconds!
Battery still connected.
What the … happened? I’m worse off now than before the tow.
My truck is manual transmission. The wrecker driver did all hat with putting in neutral etc as far as I know. He just asked for key then went about putting it on the platform.
I called insurance that dispatched the wrecker to let them know.
I know what to do about my drive shaft but what do I do about this strange noise and starting issue?

195,Light bulbs aren’t working,Maintenance/Repairs,2,134,"A “mechanic” tried 4 different light bulbs for one of my rear brake lights, none of which worked. (The “mechanic” was part of a tire dealership.) The  light’s housing had a hole in it which meant that water got inside it whenever it rained. Is this gonna mean spending a whole lot? Thanks.Well it seems there is a wire connection problem going to the light socket or the socket itself is bad. It shouldn’t cost a lot to fix this kind of problem if the tech knows what he is doing. It’s a very simple problem. The trouble could possibly be at the flasher unit. It would be nice to know if the light works with the flashers on or the turn signal if it shares the same light.It’s likely the wiring harness or the socket the bulb fits into, probably the socket. It might be corrosion. You need to find a shop to troubleshoot the problem and replace or repair whatever is not functioning properly. If you feel handy, you could do it yourself.

196,"Can removing a stereo cause a power drain, even if the wires have been tested to check and nothing shows up",Maintenance/Repairs,11,336,"I’m thinking the stereo removal is the hidden culprit.
So I bought a pretty rundown but otherwise reliable 1999 Infiniti g20. I hardly know jack about cars, so the mechanic duties fall on my fiance. He’s an experienced mechanic. Only thing he ever did to it before we sold it was take the stereo out, it is a Pioneer AVH-P23OODVD. A really good friend of mine needed a vehicle, my fiance was confident selling it to her so I trusted his decision but I had a feeling if things went wrong I’d feel responsible. Immediately it gave her issues, battery started draining so I bought a new one and he replaced it. Alternator died. Bought one for her. Replaced it. Battery died again. Bought. Replaced it. She took it lots of people and got all sorts of different opinions, different work done, the bottom line has been there’s a mysterious power drain and nobody can figure it. It finally went a few days without dying on her but it’s happened again. I promised her to make things right I’d let her take my pontiac, pay to register it to her and everything until we fixed the issue.
No one seems to take interest when I’ve brought up the stereo being taken out, like it wouldn’t have caused the drain to happen and the wires have been checked by people from what she’s said. Ive just had an inkling that since the ONLY thing we ever did to it was take that stereo out, it could be what the cause is, and if so, would putting in another stereo help figure that out? Maybe the wires need to be hooked up to not draw unnecessary power? Like I said I don’t know much about cars, but honestly I cannot afford to keep making this right, but that is what I’ll do because that is how I am.
If anyone has any input on what I’m thinking could be the cause, please fill me in.
Also, I honestly really need my vehicle and am in the middle of moving, working graveyards  overtime, about to get major ankle surgery, taking care of a one year old, etc. My hands are full. Thank you for reading, I’m all ears.Well I made it through but it was not easy . Just take the vehicle back and refund the 500.00 and never sell to or buy from a friend or relative again.  After you get it back just list it As Is for 500.00 and take the first decent offer.I learned my lesson and will not to ever sell to a friend again, and the trading of the pontiac is only with the intention to figure out what’s wrong with the infinity, and trade back. Sorry it was not easy to read the whole thing, I write a lot as a hobby so I tend to write more and read things at a glance extremely fast. I will rewrite it as short as possible with more car facts, I’m just too artistic and not well versed in mechanic lingo.
Really what I’m wanting to know is if anyone has any theories involving the stereo removal being a source for the issue, I’ve found some interesting discussions on this site when investigating my hunch.Don’t know if removing the stereo was the problem but anytime you mess with the wire’s thing’s can happen some time’s some time’s bad.I think it’s more likely rodents chewed on the wiring someplace while it was sitting gathering dust.  I agree though just cancel the sale and get your car back.
I sold one of my Rivieras to the cousin of a girl at work who needed a car for work, desperate, etc.  All cleaned up, waxed, new battery, full tank of gas.  All it needed was a new headlight switch so I knocked the price down from $100 to $50 to cover the switch.  Outside of never transferring the title, next thing I knew she had cousins or some relative tearing the engine apart and never could get the thing fixed again.  Ran great before and served me well for 300,000 miles but then someone with a tool kit started messing with it.  Yes there are needy people but sometimes people just create their own issues and there is no way to help them.  Get your car back and refund her money.


 Tera_s-Inquiring:

Really what I’m wanting to know is if anyone has any theories involving the stereo removal being a source for the issue, I’ve found some interesting discussions on this site when investigating my hunch.


Without actually having hands on with the vehicle theories are all  that can be offered .
Bing brings up good points 1. Has the friend changed the registration  2. If not and you have cancelled the insurance on this you are looking at major financial problems.RE: Your original question about the radio.   I would think removing the fuse for the non-existent radio, then checking the parasitic draw would answer the question.  If the parasitic draw is still there, proceed R&R-ing the rest of the fuses until the circuit is isolated.
As far as a solution.  Give her back the $500.  Then have you and your mechanic boyfriend decide which is the lesser of two evils, the Infinity or the Pontiac, keep one, take the other to the recycling yard.Removing the stereo isn’t causing the battery drain issue. Something else that is connected to the power bus has a problem. Apparently people that have worked on it already haven’t found the real problem. Whatever it is, in order for a current drain to happen, the load has to be connected to the power source to allow current to flow. From what you say about the multiple battery replacements I wonder if there really is an excessive current draw problem. Normal current draw on a battery should be around 25 milliamps when things are in the ‘sleep mode’ when the car is parked. Added alarm systems and such can cause problems like this. Here is a link that helps you understand what needs to be done to find the problem.


aa1car.com



Diagnosing A Car Battery That Runs Down





That said, there are other problems that can make it seem the battery is being drained or is bad but really the battery is just fine. Intermittent faulty connections in the power bus wiring can fool you to think the battery is low or bad but it is really just fine. Someone that knows how to trouble shoot electrical problems should have no problem figuring out what is really going on with the car.
As far as letting the person use your current car, I don’t recommend you do that. Liability is the big issue here. You can check out the Judge Judy show and learn all about what happens when vehicles change hands without proper title transfers and insurance issues. You didn’t try to pull one over on your friend when you sold it and were only trying to help out. It’s a well used car and things can happen anytime. If they want a trouble free car with a warranty then they should pony up for a new car. I will bet the trouble with the car you sold them is really a pretty simple repair and not real expensive to fix correctly. Checking the battery voltage when the trouble is happening will tell what really is going on.Here’s the deal: A $500 car is sold as is/where is. There is no warranty. Your friend got one hell of a deal, because any car that starts and runs and which only costs $500 is a screaming deal, and now your “friend” wants you to pay a significant portion if not all of the purchase price back in maintenance and repair items that you are not responsible for. And then you give her another car!?
Your friend is taking advantage of you. Your friend should have realized that you are not a dealership and you are not selling a new Lamborghini. Once she drove it away, it was hers, including all the problems that may or may not develop. Your responsibility at this point is exactly nothing.Your friend sounds like they are using you. Ditch this “friend.”It’s extremely doubtful that the radio removal has anything to do with this. I have a question though.
You say your fiance is an experienced mechanic. Why has he not checked the car for a parasitic draw rather than go through multiple battery replacements and an alternator to boot?
I’m trying not to be too critical here but this kind of smacks of throwing mud at the wall and hoping something sticks.
You might clarify the battery drain part. Just because a car does not start does not mean the battery is at fault. If the engine did not physically crank over by the starter motor engagement that could point to a faulty neutral safety switch or even a corroded or burnt fusible link in the underhood fuse block which could be affecting the starter solenoid along with lighting and everything else.
I’ve done a few favors (free ones) for a couple of in-laws and suffice it to say no good deed goes unpunished. I’d be tempted to take the car back and give them their money back because I think at this point you’re being used a bit. They want a 5 year/60k miles warranty then buy a new car.has friend put another radio in the infinity to replace the one that was removed?
unless something shorted when radio was removed, an empty radio wire harness should not in any way cause a battery drain. Pull the battery fuse as was suggested.
unsolicited advice: Then tell your friend this is now her car and her problem. Either buy it back for the same price, or tell her that you are done dealing with the infinity. as @shadowfax said- any car that runs for $500 is a smoking deal, and friend should be glad that she got a car that runs for that. Have boyfriend hookup a battery kill switch (very easy to do,) and have that be the end of your dealings with the infinity.",,,,

I would guess that you have a timing chain instead of a belt. I think your engine is under the floor

Could you be thinking of the Previa, which does have engine between the seats rather than out front? I don’t know about chain vs belt on that car.
My 1999 Sienna has engine out front, and a timing belt. There are A LOT of these cars still running around, very few Previas, which says something about owners’ choice for keeping them running.  But then, it depends on the OP’s specific circumstances here to decide whether theirs is worth repair.This forum seems better than carjunky!
Been having a morning start issue. Wasted money on parts didn’t need. Found out a wire went bad and need new computer aka TIPM. Other mechanics confused.
I had Midas fix my Chrysler mini van a month ago. Got oil valves put in at that time. Van had starting issue after oil leak was fixed. Plus a private mechanic said Midas put in a bad spark plug. That’s why van drove funny. I had Midas pay for the tuneup. Still unsure if they caused the start issue or van TIPM just going bad.As Roadtripper said, that’s the Pevia, I know because I used to own one. It may or may not be worth fixing though depending on what it is.Yes that’s right I used to own a Previa in some cases they are built far better than Siennas, for one thing the Previa has the Camary engine which is known to be very dependable. So rather than post in general to the replies I’ll just update here, I went to a mechanic got the DTCs and it’s showing 3 codes multiple misfires, misfire cylinder 2. So the mechanic suggested a Tune Up, since one hasn’t been done in the 8 years I’ve owned the Sienna, the problem is while the front 3 are plugs and can be done in like 5 mins, the rear are coils behind the exhaust mani and they are a bitch to do, so I’m looking at a $400 tuneup and that may not even resolve the codes. As this video shows https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-trZWJP04vc it could just be a bad #2 ignition coil so that’s worth considering.  I’ve made a tentative appointment with the shop for next Wed. but  there is a recommended reliable mechanic right by were I’m staying that may do it for less so I’m going to go see what they have to say.

199,2000 Toyota Solara Fuel pump will not run,Maintenance/Repairs,6,243,"I have a 2000 Toyota Camry 2.2 4 cylinder that was running fine. Parked one night when it went down to Zero degrees. Would not start next morning. Still would not start when it warmed up.
Could not hear the fuel pump, so checked there first. Determined there was no power to the fuel pump, at the fuel pump connector. Removed and checked the EFI relay and the “circuit opening” relay. Both seem fine.
Determined there was power going out of the EFI relay, at the connector block, but does not seem to get to the “circuit opening” relay (behind glove box). I used a mechanics stethescope on the relay and cannot hear it click when turning on the ignition. Also used a meter at the connector to see if 12 volts was getting there. None gets there. I put on a new fuel pump aswell as a fuel pump relay but no dice. I can manually hotwire the fuel pump to run on its own, so I know for sure the fuel pump is working
Camshaft sensor connector is not getting any voltage when the ignition is on
Where should I look next? All fuses look good. I am stumped ;(
The last job I did on the car was the timing belt and water pump.
Why isn’t the fuel pump getting signal to run?   Crankshaft sensor?  Camshaft sensor?Sounds like an open circuit. Check the harnesses for continuity.Update:
Circuit Open Relay is getting power but not giving and power to fuel pumpDid you ring out the harness between the two?  Is there continuity between the leads in the circuit open relay?Keep in mind that in many cars, except for a few seconds after the key is turned to Run, the fuel pump won’t run if the oil pressure sender is not indicating the presence of oil pressure. Study the circuit diagram to see if this is the case here.The problem may be that the driver in the ECU has failed where it no longer provides power to the fuel pump circuit.
When the the ignition is turned to the run position, the ECU supplies power to the fuel pump circuit for a second or two to prime the fuel system.
Then when the ignition is turned to start, the ECU looks for the crankshaft position sensor signal to determine if should supply power to the fuel pump circuit.
If the driver in the ECU has failed, neither of these are going to occur.
A quick test to determine if the driver in the ECU has failed is, remove the fuel pump relay from its socket, and insert a jumper wire on the secondary side of the relay socket.
If the fuel pump runs and the engine starts, the ECU is the problem.
TesterHere is some info that may help you out. The trouble you are having may be due to a problem somewhere else. There are two coils in the Circuit Opening Relay. I assume they both have to be ON in order to activate the relay. There is a NE signal that goes to the ECU in order to turn on the second coil of the relay. The second link describes the NE signal.

NE Signal and G Signal - Toyota Engine Control Systems 1
Though there are different types of ignition systems, the use of the NE and G signals is consistent. The NE signal indicates crankshaft position and engine





To prove the power wiring to the pump is okay you could place jumpers in the pins of the relay  sockets that normally tie to the relay contacts. If the pump turns on that way then you know at least the power wires to the pump are okay and there isn’t a bad connection in that part of the wiring causing the issue. I assume the STA signal lead is okay since the starter works. If you apply 12 volts to the FC lead of the ECU and that makes the COR relay operate then you know that the issue is either with the NE input signal or the ECU output to the FC pin.",,,,
200,2005 Honda Oil Smoke on Start Up,Maintenance/Repairs,9,449,"Our  2005 Honda Pilot with 180k has done this twice that I have noticed:   Lots of oil smoke on start up.  It then runs fine and does not really use any oil.  At least that is noticeable.
It does not smoke while driving and seems to have normal power/etc.
In the old days it would have been valve stem seals as the #1 culprit.  Given that its a more modern car (for me anyways) is there a different thing to check first like a vacuum sensor or PCV??
Any help appreciated!!Valve stem seals would be my hunch, too. I don’t know how newer engine designs might also cause this.Classic leaky valve stems.
When my 1975 Civic [edit] CVCC did it it turned out the valve guides were also worn.
If you’re not adding oil between changes and it’s not fouling the plugs I would just drive on.My 1976 Civic CVCC did, too, big time.

In the old days it would have been valve stem seals as the #1 culprit.


You have the classic symptoms
You speak about modern cars, but your car is 16yrs old and has 180K milesMy 1984 Chevy Impala 305 V8 did precisely that. Since it started at about 150,000 miles when the car was 9 years old, I just added oil at about 1500 miles and carried on. After giving the car to my son in college, he did the same and 4 years later sold the car for $750.Thank you all for the quick replies!!
db4690: 15 yrs old IS modern for me!!
I was hoping it was something else but I really dont feel like getting it fixed if it is indeed valve seals.
If there is any other input or things to look for pls post your ideas.UPDATE!!!  The old Honda has been smoking for a while now and we even gave it the nickname ‘Old Smokey’.
I had a leaky valve cover and changed out a gasket, wondered what the little plastic thingy on the front of the cover was, especially becasue it came out in pieces.  I found out it is the PCV.
I replaced it and wonder-of-wonders, the oil burning has ceased!!Was the smoke emitted from the tail pipe or from the engine compartment?It was from the exhaust.  It seems that oil would get trapped in the broken pcv as’y and when the engine started the hi vacuum condition must have sucked it up.",,,,
201,To “Start” do you always turn the key in the clockwise direction?,General Discussion,61,9.0k,"The reason I ask is because I was watching that TV science show “Cosmos” that originally aired on commercial TV in 2014, I was watching it on DVD to avoid the commercials.  One episode is in part about the subject of tetraethyl lead and the scientist back in the 1960’s who investigated whether or not it was introducing lead into the environment.    Anyway, there’s a short cartoon segment in which the scientist gets into his car, then turns the key counterclockwise to start the engine.  This seemed sort of weird to me, probably just a mistake during editing.  But then I got to wondering if there are indeed cars in which the key has to be turned counterclockwise to start?
Are there any cars – past or present – in which you turn the key in the counterclockwise direction to start the car?  And any speculations why most cars use the clockwise direction?There may well be a car that needs ccw turn though I do not know of one. Different manufactures have been doing reverse things forever. In the days of single sided keys, gm points on the key went down, chrysler went up. crank windows clockwise for own in gm, counter clockwise in dodge etc, I think it even applies to electric windows, some pull up to lower the window, others push down.I feel confident that someone designed a CCW ignition cylinder at some time in the past.
After all, if Chrysler designed CCW threads on their wheel studs on one side (and they did), nothing is too dumb!
Don’t bother with the technical explanation guys, I already know it. It was dumb anyway.Chrysler Corp. was not the only automaker to use left hand threads on the drivers side.  It was an engineering decision. With left hand threads on the left side , loose lug nuts have less tendency to come off.I am not familiar with the art in drawing a cartoon cel, but I wonder if it was drawn clockwise and in the process of transferring to film if it got turned around. Like looking in a mirror.
They always thought that Billy the Kid was left handed because of an old photo. Someone finally noticed that the Winchester rifle he was holding …the loading gate was on the wrong side.
I’m sure photographers have a term for the reversal of images like that.
YosemiteAs far as I can remember they all go CW except for the ones that had the starter on the floor.  I suppose someone sometime might have but that engineer is long dead by now.  I’ve been through Disney’s animation studio and you have to remember that these folks are artists.  Not necessarily mechanically inclined but it could have gotten reversed too.While I have driven some vehicles with starter switches that would not be recognized by many and likely no one younger than 40 would know what to do to crank the engine on quite a few models but I have never seen a CCW crank position. Not to say there wasn’t one. I have faith that if there was someone here will post a picture.They do, Yosemite, it’s called “reversing the image”…
Sorry. Couldn’t resist. {I deserved that one!!!
YosemiteOK, you got me thinking now about reversed images.  I don’t remember the guys name but the Sheriff on Jaws always had his badge on the RIGHT side of his shirt instead of the LEFT over his heart.  It always drove me nuts.  No law enforcement officer would ever do that and I always wondered WHY?Yosemite  Reversed cells in the animation was the first thing I thought of. The “left handed gun” Billy the kid photo was the first example I thought of. All model 1873 Winchesters in fact all lever action Winchesters except the model 1895 and model 88 which had box magazines had the loading gate on the right side. Henry rifles did not have a loading gate and were not Winchesters though they looked like one.
Rod Knox  I have driven vehicles with the starter switch on the floor. My Austin Healey Sprite MK1 had a button on the dash. The turn signal switch was a 3 way toggle next to it. I’m sure most of the youngsters think the starter buttons on some modern cars is a new invention. Was it Buicks that had the starter switch under the accelerator pedal?Yes Buicks had it under the gas pedal, and Studebakers had it under the clutch pedal.  And it was real common to have a big push pedal over the gas, through the firewall, until right after WWII.  A 52 Hillman Minx had a pull knob on the dash.  Fords had the key slot on the left side of the dash in the 50’s and 60’s.  You could turn the key to OFF and pull it out, and then turn the car on and off without the key on GM cars around 1960 or so.  You had to turn it to LOCK to really lock up the ignition.Bing, there might be another reason. I saw an interview in TV once where they said that the city they were filming in required that they wear their badges on the wrong side (in order to get their permits) to prevent the citizenry from mistaking the actors for real cops.That’s interesting and would certainly explain it.  It really looked goofy though with the badge on the right.My hazy memory seesm to recall some older cars that had a CCW ignition switch but I simply can’t  coax a brain cell into remembering for certain.
Ford trucks in the 50s/60s (???) maybe with a dashboard mounted switch to the left of the steering column? I’m probably beyond dead wrong; just throwing it out there.
I also do not remember for sure if those switches were CCW or “normal”.Another fuzzy thought of which I’m not certain is the ignition switch on a BMW motorcycle I had.
I vaguely remember that switch as being CCW but after so many years I’m just not sure.My Ford van had the ignition to the left of the steering wheel.  I’ve never seen a vehicle where you turn the ignition CCW though.  Maybe in Europe?
Other oddball things–my dad’s 1966 Toronado had the heater controls on the left of the wheel, and all Chrysler vehicles I’ve owned with mechanical odometers, the numbers “roll in” from the top, towards you as the miles click away, not from bottom to top, like most vehicles.Yes sgtrock21…my 1958 Buick Century had the starter switch under the accelerator pedal. I remember it well. The ignition switch was on the dash.I thought the neutral safety switch on the 1948 Pontiac with the Hydramatic automatic transmission was interesting.  The starter was activated  by a pedal on the floor above the accelerator.  Stepping on the pedal also pushed down on the accelerator, pushed the starter pinion gear into the flywheel and then closed the switch sending power to the starter motor.  On the Hydramatic equipped models, a lever from the starter pedal,put the selector in neutral.  The shift sequence was,N D L R.  There was no park position.  The  car was parked with the selector in reverse.  Stepping on the starter moved the selector into N.  This was,a great system–no starter solenoid to give problems–no neutral safety switch to act up.  The 1949 Pontiac had a pushbutton on the dashboard to actvate the starter solenoid,and there was an electrical neutral safety switch.  However, for one year, GM got it right in the 1948 Pontiac.  By the way,_1948 was the first year for an automatic transmission in the Pontiac.I guess we are a bunch of “senior citizens”?",,,,

Recently it has started slipping when in 4-high and first gear. After first gear it is totally fine and in 4-low or 2-high there are no problems.If it’s slipping it’s usually the clutch.Agree with Mike… there is really nothing else TO slip in a manual trans driveline but the clutch.Stop running it in 4 hi.

204,"2005 Honda Civic fluctuating temp gauge, not heating well",Maintenance/Repairs,6,219,"2005 Honda Civic 190,000 miles. The car does not heat up fast like it used to. Thermostat has been replaced. On a couple recent occasions, the temp gauge fluctuated between normal, fully hot and cold (up and down and back up and down, etc.) over the course of a few minutes. Car seems to run fine. The repair shop has not been able to replicate the problem and initially seemed stumped, and now says it’s probably the head gasket. They have said the coolant remains pressurized hours after turning engine off. Before I agree to the expensive repair, what should I make sure has been checked? Thanks.Time for a second opinion my thought.I also thought of a bad head gasket as the cause of the issue. You can have the coolant checked for exhaust gases to prove that is the case.There were some Honda engines that developed a cracked block. I’m not sure which ones, and whether the crack led to your symptoms.
The head gasket can be tested in several ways. Constant bubbles at the open radiator neck are a strong clue. An exhaust gas analyzer can sniff for unburned hydrocarbons at the open radiator filler neck. There is a chemical test that can detect changes in the coolant due to exhaust gasses.


 kmj4458_172723:

On a couple recent occasions, the temp gauge fluctuated between normal, fully hot and cold (up and down and back up and down, etc.) over the course of a few minutes.


I almost wonder if the system either isn’t completely full and/or there’s an air bubble moving through the cooling system, but if it’s been to the mechanics, I’d think they would’ve checked that already…I think having the system checked for exhaust gases to check for a bad head gasket would be a good idea tooMy Honda uses a water valve to control flow through the heater core. The heat needs to be set on Hot to open this valve all the way - which helps the system expel any trapped air out the filler neck.When the engine is cold, remove the radiator cap.
Start the engine and let it idle while watching the coolant in the radiator.
If bubbles begin forming in the coolant, it indicates a blown head gasket.

205,"Alternator, Starter, or Something Else?",Maintenance/Repairs,7,270,"Hello All,
My beloved 2000 Chevy Prizm has 244K miles, 161K with me behind the wheel and almost nothing done under the hood besides regular maintenance.  Turned the key a few days after a 2 hour trip back home for Thanksgiving and the car wouldn’t start.  Dash lights come on, fan starts to blow, and it clicks like crazy.  No change when battery is hooked up to another car for a jump.  About 5 years ago, I had a similar problem, and it was just connectors loose on the terminals.  But I’ve checked and they seem tight.  Could it be as simple as a loose cable?  Or does it have to be starter or alternator?  Thanks.The battery may be bad.
How old is it?
When a battery is deeply discharged and jumper cables are attached, it may require the donating vehicle idle for a while so the car with the dead battery will start.
TesterSo the car wouldn’t start but did the engine crank? I.e spin when the key was turned to start?Click click click indicates no starter turning,  Suggests battery, cables, or connection issues.  A bad or discharged battery will not always respond to a jump.  If all that checks out, could also be a bum starter.  Impossible to tell from here.The battery is pretty old (I’ve only replaced it once in those 161K miles!) and we didn’t wait more than 10 seconds with the other vehicle idling before turning the key in my car.  Also, we just hit our first real cold snap here in Tennessee, but it had just the slightest struggle (like one extra second to start up) a few morning prior, and now it’s not starting.
Mustagnman, I’m not at the home where it’s parked right now,  I need to listen to the clicking again, but I think the engine was cranking.Assuming the clicking sound is a starter solenoid chatter, that usually points to a bad or discharged battery or possibly the battery cable terminals.
The fact the terminals are tight may mean nothing. They can develop a scale on the cable ends and battery posts. They should be periodically cleaned.I also think that the battery is discharged or possibly needs to be replaced. Remove the cable connections and use a battery post cleaning brush to thoroughly clean the contact surfaces of the clamps and the battery posts. Hopefully that will get you going again.It may well be time for a new battery, installed with clean and tight connectors. If it does not cure this problem, another cause of non-cranking can be the copper contacts inside the starter’s solenoid. An auto electric shop will know all about it and can probably fix and test your starter, if you can take it in and reinstall it yourself.",,,,
206,Exhaust fumes in cabin of 2000 Honda Civic,Maintenance/Repairs,13,3.9k,"About two years ago, I noticed the smell of exhaust fumes in the cabin of my 2000 Honda Civic any time the vents were set to pull air from outside the cabin.  Switching the vents to recirculate would prevent the fumes.  Looking under the hood, I found the exhaust manifold was cracked, so I replaced it along with the catalyic converter (actually one piece in this model) and two O2 sensors.  Since the replacement, the problem with exhaust fumes remains.  I have asked my mechanic to look at this a couple of times, and he could not find the cause.  I’m looking for suggestions on what to try next to diagnose the problem.  We use the car frequently, and just have to leave the vents set on recirculate.  This becomes an issue on rainy, humid days when recirculate causes the windows to fog.  Any suggestions would be much appreciated.Do you have a carbon monoxide sensor?  You might bring one into the car and test the air with the recirc on and off.  That will tell you if you have a CO build-up.  You can always buy one if you don’t have one and use it in your house after testing the car.  Most run on 120-AC; you may need a converter for the car, too.Other sources of exhaust fumes under the hood include the EGR and riser pipe. There is also a sensor on the EGR pipe that checks for EGR flow. This sensor generally has two small pipes and flex lines that attach to the EGR riser pipe. A break or crack in any of these can also allow exhaust fumes into the engine compartment.What about a slow leak around the valve cover seal?  I usually see some grim around the seal.  If I wipe it clean, it will build up again in a few weeks.  Could that leaking oil be burning when the block get hot and causing fumes?  I haven’t had to add oil to the car between changes, so it can’t be leaking much oil.Hi Jonblack1234,
I have the same car and the same smell.  I’ve taken it to my local mechanic and he is stumped so I did some research and found your link.
Did you find the problem that was causing this smell?It could be something other than exhaust fumes being noticed.  Checking for CO as mentioned above is a good idea.    Oil leaks getting on something hot will cause a stink in the engine compartment which could easily get pulled in through fresh air vents.  And might mimic the smell of an exhaust leak.  As will transmission fluid leaks.
Are there any fluid drip-stains under where you park the car at night?  If so, replacing the suspect  valve cover gaskets might be a good idea.    I had some oil drops under my Corolla, couldn’t tell exactly where they were coming from but it seemed like the valve covers might be leaking so I replaced those gaskets, fairly simple and inexpensive job,  and the under-car drips totally went away.  In my case there was no odor problem though.  Well, not with the car at least  … lol …Thanks there is a minor oil leak on the front main seal, 200K on the motor and trans but nothing major and below the exhaust system.  I’ve read a few issue with PCV, hose, etc…@jonblack1234
Ask your shop to use an evap/smoke machine to find any possible exhaust leaks
That’s what I do, and it is very effectiveI know this is an old thread, but I’m having this problem, but it’s never in summer with a/c. The last 2 winters it started when I had to start using heat. Last winter it actually stopped eventually so I forgot about it. Here I am beginning to use heat again and it’s back, for now anyway. When I warm up the car, I’ve stopped turning on the heat and that seems to keep the smell from building inside the car, but I can smell the fumes pretty strong around the outside of the car. Once I’m driving and not idling the smell is faint (I think it just comes in when I open the door to get in) and eventually fades out. Sometimes I crack the window while driving to pull the smell out. I’m looking for answers, but I don’t see where anyone said they found a solution. I’m hoping to eventually find an answer. I have no idea if this will stop like last winter or continue on.A mechanic should be able to check your exhaust system for any leaks, and check if any oil is dripping onto it, which causes fumes. Do you see any oil leaks?
What is the make model year miles for your car?OK , once again I don’t understand this situation .  Someone has a problem with smelling exhaust fumes that can make a person very ill or even be fatal … Instead of having a shop solve this they ask a bunch of strangers on the web what to do .  Because I have found tons of solutions to different problems with both of my cars by seeking online where people have shared when the same situation happened with them and they already did the troubleshooting. Why reinvent the wheel if not necessary. If I don’t find a way to fix it then I will gladly take it to my mechanic.Unless you have the equipment needed to elevate your car so you can safely inspect the entire exhaust system, and have access to an exhaust leak detector, this is better left to a pro.  And it is a major safety issue, if it is an exhaust leak.There’s a good locally-owned muffler shop in many towns. That’s where I take my exhaust problems. They’ve seen it all and know where to look.",,,,

 Tester:

Even though the OP did not reveal the model year of his 960, it couldn’t be less than 22 years old, so rust damage is also a possibility.
Back in my gas jockey days, I had to deal with a number of older vehicles with so much rust damage that some of the hood bolts had parted company with the hood, and they could not be… reunited… without welding.



 old_mopar_guy:

Take the car to a good body shop and show them the problem. They can fix that.

With a vehicle that is at least 22 years old, this is a very likely scenario.The offending hinge may be rusty and in need of lubrication.Yes the hinge on the left doesn’t lift as high as the one on the rightA good squirt of oil - real oil like 3 in 1, not WD40 which is not a worthwhile lube - might solve the problem.  Otherwise, an auto body shop, as already recommended.So my dad says that I have to pull it towards me on the passenger side and it’ll pop up, does anybody know why it’s like that or no?

208,2008 Audi S6 P1075 code after fuel additive,Maintenance/Repairs,4,270,"I used a fuel additive as I want to decrease the carbon buildup as these DI engines are heavily known for it, then several days later the CEL came on and Scanner read a code of P1075, the fuel/air ratio was running rich in bank 2. Are there any common issues in the 08 S6 that would cause this?You might want to post this on Audi forums, there might be someone there that has had this happen.The causes of a P0175 are below:

Faulty front heated oxygen sensor
Ignition misfiring
Faulty fuel injectors
Exhaust gas leaks
Incorrect fuel pressure
Faulty Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor

Read more: https://www.autocodes.com/p0175_audi.html 1
For a V6, #5 and #6 can likely be ruled out since both banks would see a lean condition. #2 would likely throw a P030# misfire code for one or more bank 2 cylinders.
Since you have a scanner read the Long Term Fuel Trims (LTFT) at idle for each bank. Then drive the car on the highway and record the LTFT’s. Post them here. That should identify a leaking injector.
You should also compare both the upstream O2 sensors’ readings cold and after warmup. If you can strip chart the data in your app, watch how each O2 sensors changes over time.
I’d recommend these tests whether you have an Audi or a Chevy with a  V6.A fuel additive doesn’t prevent carbon deposits from forming on the intake valves on direct injected engines.
That’s because the additive doesn’t come in contact with the intake valves.

209,Road trip south with snow tires,Maintenance/Repairs,13,468,"I live in an area that gets a good amount of snow, so I am considering buying studless winter tires for this season. However, I am also planning a road trip to southern California by way of Boise and Las Vegas this January. This route takes me on Highway 95 in Idaho (considered by some to be one of the most dangerous highways in the country) and through the Mojave Desert! I’ve tried to read what other forums say on using winter tires in warmer climates, and I feel I’ve gotten some mixed messages. Everything from, “It’s perfectly fine,” to, “It’s very dangerous.” Any advice? I drive a 2018 Toyota Corolla.
Thank youI run my winter tires all-year-round.
No problem.
However, the state I live in prohibits the use of studded tires because of the damage they do to the roads.
Find out if the states you plan on driving thru also prohibit the use of studded tires.
TesterI think they’re running them studless.Old tires are gone? What happens next summer? Future plans?
Coworker has 20” snowtires on her new bmwx5. Drove on them all summer. Must be ok.It’s not dangerous, but the tires will wear more quickly than normal, especially if you’re above 60 degrees or so, because they’re designed to be soft enough in colder temperatures.
I don’t want to talk you out of winter tires if you need them, but have you investigated the 3PMSF all-season tires such as the Michelin CrossClimate family?I used to drive to Florida for 2 weeks vacation pretty much every year with the winter tires on my car. No problem what-so-ever. No excessive wear, no dire handling consequences, none.
Also always had warm early spring days with rain before winter was really over and, again, no issues at all. Winter tires are wonderful in the rain because they have so many grooves and sipes.The only problem will be road noise.If you can stand the noise then go right ahead.My winter beater car named( monsterolla) runs 4 snow tires all year without any problem.


 COROLLAGUY1:

If you can stand the noise


Very tire specific, from past experience. Blizzaks were pretty quiet. Firestone Winterforce, OH MY goodness were they noisy! Good tires, though, just noisy.If the snow tires have decent tread, I wouldn’t worry about it, assuming you aren’t going to drive way fast once you get to SoCal. You aren’t going to put significant mileage on them, probably a couple thousand for the entire trip. IMO, you should be fine.My first awd vehicle in 2008, never bought snow tires, no reason to play road warrior until the roads are plowed, so hole up in a hotel if needed, sorry if this upsets others, only lived in WI, MN, and ND for winter experience.It’s not too warm in the Mojave Desert this time of year and when you travel you might have snow to start with. I don’t see any trouble. I quit swapping tires and use snow tires all year long.When you ask a tire question the answers are almost always evenly distributed between “very dangerous” and “no problem”.  So far your answers are mostly “no problem”.  I agree.  You could run into snow anywhere except Coastal California.  There you might find heavy rain.  It is winter, after all.  Get those tires and enjoy the ride.Thank you all for the responses. I feel much better informed now. What a great community!I’ve ran snow tires on many vehicles. Some studded and some not. Some awd, some (most) rwd.  They do make a difference. They do growl and they do wear fast. Ive ran blizzaks and x-ice  the last few years. Usually I get two winters to a set. The second winter I just leave them on during spring until they are worn completely.  No issues.",,,,

TOP TIER™ Gasoline Brands 14





Top Tier gas is the standard of major gas brands.
TesterBad gas is such a rarity that the only thing I do is avoid some off the wall gas and grocery store in the middle of no where.
If you follow a fuel truck from a refinery you will see it stop at several different brands . The only real difference is the additives they put in with the fuel.
Edit :  A simple Google search would have answered  the question for Clueless .  The Phillips 66 site will show that they actually have more additives than required by the EPA and more than needed for a Top Tier rating.I’ve never noticed any difference in gasoline brands when it comes to performance or fuel mileage. Living out in the sticks, almost all of my gas is purchased from a couple of mom and pop stations; a.k.a. non-Top Tier. In 30+ years I’ve never heard of or seen an issue with that fuel and both have a substantial amount of gasoline sales.
Shell and Phillips are both Top Tier brands along with dozens of others. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the fuel that any of them sell.
Now and then if the tank is low I may fill up with Top Tier but it’s only because that particular station was in my way…   I buy the cheapest Top Tier gas near me (Quick Trip).  No need to make it any more complicated.If you have some free time, read this study sponsored by AAA:

Luckily for me, although we have very few Top Tier stations here, one of them is the closest station to my house and it’s usually one of the cheapest in town, so that makes the decision easy for me.


 VOLVO-V70:

Bad gas is such a rarity that the only thing I do is avoid some off the wall gas and grocery store in the middle of no where.


Agreed. I’m a lot more concerned about the security of the gas station’s card readers than I am about the quality of their gas. There’s a gas station the next suburb over that sells bongs – er, “water pipes for tobacco” – and those little glass vials with fabric roses in them (also known as crack pipes). I figure if they’re catering that hard to the criminal element, the criminal element might just target their pumps for skimmers, and some of those things are hard to find.All the brands near me are Top Tier but I go to the one’s that are the most convienent.I didn’t buy any top-tier gas until about 2 years ago. There wasn’t a single top-tier gas anywhere near me. But 2 years ago a local chain (Irving Oil) is now top-tier. And they are one of the cheaper stations, and the closest to my house and my commute. Never really noticed a difference. Top-Tier gas may make a difference long term. You won’t see any difference from tank to tank.The only gas where I could notice a difference was Mobil , for some reason  my vehicles  engines seem to run and idle smoother with less buziness .The brand of gasoline I believed to be the best back in the late 1940s through 1956 was Cities Service (now Citgo).  Cities Service sponsored Paul LaValle and the Cities Service Band of America that was on a national radio network every Monday evening.  I thought when I would own a car, I would use only Cities Service gasoline.  However, after Cities Service quit sponsoring the Band of America radio broadcasts, I have no brand allegiance.Year’s back I remember a brand called Gulf the reason I remember is that no matter what I was driving it would run like crap if I had to use it.

That’s one gas I refuse to buy. Every once in a while I have to use it because it’s the only one around…and there is a noticeable decrease in performance and gas mileage.

Just the opposite here. Cumberland Farms uses is a local franchise that uses Gulf gas. It’s not a top-tier, but our vehicles always run well on it.[quote=""MikeInNH

 Triedaq:

Back in my gas jockey days, I pumped Citgo into people’s tanks, and it was not unusual for cars to stall shortly after filling-up at our station.    Because our station was literally just a few feet away from a marsh area, I was pretty sure that water had contaminated the tanks, but I wasn’t in charge, so all I could do was to observe and to speculate.
A few times, customers asked if it was possible that there was water in the gas that they had just bought, and my usual response was, Yes! It will help to clean your engine!
Luckily, nobody ever punched me.It’s always fun to point out to people that you very rarely, if ever, see a gasoline truck with a brand name on the tanks.  The trucks pick up their loads at a distribution location, and the trailer is divided into sections so each section gets its own product, but the products are from the same basic supply. Regular is regular, but Shell adds certain chemicals and color, Mobil adds different things or different recipes, Chevron the same deal.  If it’s going to a no name station they add nothing.  Premium gasoline is done the same way, and if the station has a mid-grade it means they mix half regular and half premium together on the way to the nozzle.  Regular gasoline is a commodity, a very common product used by all the retailers.  There’s a different winter and summer blend in many places, but that’s regional, not brand specific.

Nothing I can prove, but I firmly believe that gas companies have been splitting up the presence into different regions to reduce competition. Growing up in Central NY 50 years ago we had all the brands. Today it’s limited to a handful. The rest moved out. And some of those brands in NY you can’t find here in NH.
Before Covid I was traveling at least once a month to different parts of the country. Each region has their own set of gas stations not found in other regions.I remember when Gulf gas had a grade below “regular” called Gulftane.  Sunoco had blending pumps and “regular” was 200.  The lowest octane was 190.  My 1965 Rambler ran just fine on Gulftane and Sunoco 190 and I saved 1¢ a gallon.That’s why @Triedaq is wealthy today.

You can’t just say “CBD will do (x) to your driving ability” because that’s like saying “everything made in a brewery will get you drunk,” while forgetting that root beer is often made in breweries.
A lot of CBD products don’t have any THC in them at all, and so won’t impair you any more than any other non-intoxicant.


 shadowfax:

I don’t disagree with your conclusion, but I question your logic.  After all, a drug can be non-intoxicating and still adversely affect your ability to drive.  I’m struggling to think if examples, but a stimulant might be as detrimental to driving as a depressant.  Know what I mean?I’m just not up on this whole pot/drug thing.  I guess all I want to know is if pot smokers are a hazard on the road or not.  Maybe someone can just put this in plain English.


 shadowfax:

Absolutely. And CBD  doesn’t require a prescription, either if it has no THC.
It is illegal to drive while intoxicated. CBD isn’t an intoxicant. It includes legal intoxicants like alcohol, THC (depending on your state) and even prescription drugs. Alcohol is easy to field test, THC isn’t, yet.


 Bing:

I guess all I want to know is if pot smokers are a hazard on the road or not. Maybe someone can just put this in plain English.


IMHO, the answer is that, yes, being high on anything will impair your ability to pay attention, steer smoothly, and react quickly, although I consider alcohol a more powerful impairment than the devil’s lettuce.
If I had my druthers, I’d want every driver to be sober in every respect.  In lieu of that, if I had to choose between 10 drunk drivers (on alcohol) and 10 stoned drivers (on weed), I’d choose the 10 stoned drivers.Virginia has it covered see clause (iii)
§ 18.2-266. Driving motor vehicle, engine, etc., while intoxicated, etc.
It shall be unlawful for any person to drive or operate any motor vehicle, engine or train (i) while such person has a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent or more by weight by volume or 0.08 grams or more per 210 liters of breath as indicated by a chemical test administered as provided in this article, (ii) while such person is under the influence of alcohol, (iii) while such person is under the influence of any narcotic drug or any other self-administered intoxicant or drug of whatsoever nature, or any combination of such drugs, to a degree which impairs his ability to drive or operate any motor vehicle, engine or train safely, (iv) while such person is under the combined influence of alcohol and any drug or drugs to a degree which impairs his ability to drive or operate any motor vehicle, engine or train safely, or (v) while such person has a blood concentration of any of the following substances at a level that is equal to or greater than: (a) 0.02 milligrams of cocaine per liter of blood, (b) 0.1 milligrams of methamphetamine per liter of blood, © 0.01 milligrams of phencyclidine per liter of blood, or (d) 0.1 milligrams of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine per liter of blood.

 Whitey:

If it was straight marijuana, then I’d probably choose the same if I had to pick one of the two. The problem we’ve run into around here, is that people are either smoking medical grade with much higher concentrations of THC (and most of the people I’ve seen coming into our ER after smoking that stuff are as bad as drunken people, if not worse) or they’re smoking marijuana that’s had K2 mixed into it.


 Bing:

Yes…no question they are a hazard. I have no problem with people drinking or smoking or any other drug they want to abuse their body with…just don’t overate any vehicle on any roads. Laws in this country are still too lax for DUI. IMHO - first offense should be  heavy fine and mandatory drivers ed classes. Second offense - 1 year in prison and loss of license for life.They’re both too lax and not lax enough. The laws that say standing next to your car with the keys in your pocket and a cold engine is sufficient to judge that you were drunk driving are asinine as well. If I’m drunk at home (not that I ever am) and go out to my car to get something but I don’t even turn it on, that should not mean that I am legally driving drunk, yet people have been tried, convicted, and lost appeals after doing exactly that.
Meanwhile the guy who actually drives drunk has 10 DUI convictions and somehow manages to find his way back behind the wheel.  The laws are stupid at both ends.",,,,
215,Looking at used Subarus for my 16-year-old,Buying/Selling,23,668,"Looking at used cars for my 16 yr old son. Narrowed down to a used Subaru. Looking at Imprezza, Forester, Outback, or Legacy. Any suggestions on better model and better years? Looking to spend under $8k if possible.Google “Subaru head gasket problems”. What made you decide on Subaru? Their supposed better safety? (They aren’t).Maybe head gaskets have already been replaced, his was a 2014, and was worried about taking a trip and thinking of getting rid of the sub. I said don’t worry take the trip, there are no guarantees.I might suggest passing on an All Wheel used vehicle of that age . Especially one that does not do well with mismatched tires .Why not ask your kid if he has a preference?Usually you narrow it down to class/size of car and then decide between different makes. Budget is also a significant factor. If you do not need AWD, then don’t buy a Subaru. Otherwise, if money is not an issue, the larger the car the safer it will be, but it will use more gas.


 VOLVO-V70:

+1
Speaking as someone who is now driving his 3rd Subaru (and who plans to buy #4 w/in a year or so),
I would not buy a used AWD vehicle.  In addition to the always-existing possible problems with used cars resulting from lousy maintenance on the part of the previous owner(s), you have to add the chance of damage to the AWD system caused by failure to rotate the tires on a consistent basis and/or running the car with mis-matched tires.
All too many people do not maintain their cars properly (overly extended oil change intervals, failure to change the trans fluid every 30k miles, failure to flush the brake fluid every 3 years) and these bad practices will cause the new buyer’s wallet to explode as a result of repair costs.  But, when you add the probability of AWD problems because of bad practices in regard to the car’s tires, you are just adding to the list of potential time bombs.Thanks everyone for your feedback. Decided to look at used Honda Accords. May have to up the budget a bit to get one. 2013 appears to be the most reliable of all model years.


 Neil03:

2013 appears to be the most reliable of all model years.


Don’t go by year .  All used vehicles need to stand on their own . A good shop will charge about 125.00 to look it over .  Example : If one year had transmissions that were not as good as it should have been the vehicle you look at could have had it fixed .I agree 100%. I was on my 3rd transmission on my 99 TL (before I sold it) which supposedly was deemed bulletproof by the car experts (4spd).
I will most certainly take whatever I am looking at to my local mechanic whom I’ve built a relationship for a PPI.Subarus seem over rated to me but my experience with them is pre 2000 models. Early on I saw that the reliability and safety reputation was somewhat over stated and like Volvo they have gone down the path of opulence tacked onto declining safety and reliability despite their image. The plain Jane Honda Pilot seems a much better buy for the buck to me. But then I drive a 1989 S-10 Blazer so what do I know?Accord is dad car. Why not a civic? Si.Accord is one of my usual recommendations in cases like this, along with Civic, Corolla and Camry.Note that the Accord V6 engine has a timing belt and needs to be replaced every 7 years or 105,000 miles, whichever comes first. I’d bet that anyone selling a 2013 V6 doesn’t want to pay for the timing belt change. I replaced the timing belt on my 2005 in 2012 for $700. That included the timing belt, water pump, coolant, and serpentine belt. I suppose it could be over $800 by now. I replaced my Accord EX V6 with a 2017 Accord EX L with the 4-cylinder and CVT transmission. I’m happy with it. You didn’t say whether you would consider the V6, and I thought I’d tell you of a probable big up front expense.Wow guess you had a Honda dealer do the timing belt service. I replaced timing belt/water pump/belt tensioner twice on my Acura TL and never paid more than $500 from a local mechanic.On my fourth Subie and I don’t recommend used ones to anybody.Thanks everyone. I think we can officially put this topic to bed.
Looking at used Accords. No more Subarus.

220,Do i need a subwoofer or is just a CD enough?,Buying/Selling,30,697,"So I bought new speakers for my car (Citroen C4 2007) rear and front.
My current CD is old and doesn’t have an AUX input nor Bluetooth so I can’t really play music from my phone/Spotify.
A mechanic told me that he can sell me a supreme CD that will optimize my new speakers to their fullest, that CD is pretty expensive…
I looked at the internet and found a pretty nice CD (I think?) its called Nakamichi NQ711B.
It has a microphone, AUX, Bluetooth, USB, and an app to control the bass, vol, etcetera… It costs much less but I wonder… Will my audio experience decreases if I won’t get the more expensive CD? If no is there a reason to buy an expensive CD? And if just a cheap CD but also a good subwoofer is what I need?I was surprised to see that Nakamichi sells for about $50.  Nakamichi used to be a very high-end brand.  No longer - like Dual, it is now used for ultra-cheap electronics.  I don’t think any $50 head unit would be considered ‘good’, especially if it has all those inputs/outputs.  It can’t have much power, and clean, wide frequency response power is important to avoid distortion.  I’d plan on spending $150 or more.Cheap radio head units will be cheap in quality (possibly in sound quality, most definitely in build quality,) but that doesn’t necessarily mean that the most expensive will be the best in your situation.
do some research- read head unit reviews on crutchfield.com, on Amazon.com, on Citroen forums, and then decide what you are after compared to what your wallet can afford and what is practical for your car.


 texases:

Nakamichi used to be a very high-end brand. No longer


Yeah. Sad but familiar story. They made world class high end tape systems, and then when CDs came along they just fell by the wayside because they didn’t innovate. They went bankrupt something like 20 years ago and were bought out by a Chinese company.
OP, why are you going to a mechanic for car audio advice. Most mechanics aren’t also audio experts. You need to talk to a car audio installer. The Crutchfield suggestion is a good one, though you might not be able to order from them depending on what country you live in.Unless you are just sitting in a parking space with the engine off, the automobile is a lousy audio environment.  Even sitting in a parking space with the engine off, it is still not a very good audio environment.  It is full of hard surfaces that reflect too much sound muddying it up.  When moving, road noises and wind noise intrude making the low volume sections hard to hear and drowning out the higher frequencies.
It is also a temporary environment.  People tend to not keep their vehicles all that long, and you are starting with a vehicle that is already 13-14 years old.  Yet despite all this, some people will invest more in a sound system for their car than they will for their living room.
But, to answer your question, a low buck head unit will have some serious limitations to getting the most of the system.  One thing for example, you might compare two units that claim to have equal power out, the high end unit will claim (and probably actually have) a lower THD (total harmonic distortion). Many will be at 0.1% or lower while the cheaper unit will have 10% at max power, if they even list the THD at all.  Most cheap units won’t because it is not good.
THD is very important as it caused by clipping the signal.  Think of a spring.  Let’s say the initial stiffness of the spring is 1kG per cm of stretch or compression.  For the first 5 cm, it is pretty consistent.  5cm of compression or stretch requires 5kG, 3cm requires 3kG etc.  But as you go beyond 5cm, it requires more than 1kG for every cm, say 6.5kG to go to 6cm, 8.5kG to reach 7, 11kG to reach 8cm and 20kG to reach 9cm.  You. are approaching the limits of the spring.  To go from 5 to 9 cm require an additional 15kG.
An amplifier has limits too.  For example a 0.01v to 0.1v input may produce a 1 to 10 watt output that is linear.  But above a 0.1v input, less power out is produced so the output curve will start to flatten out.  When that happens, the amplifier starts to produce harmonics that did not exist in the original signal, thus distorting the input.
This is only one way the more expensive amplifier is worth the extra cost.  There are quite a few other parameters to be considered as well but this post would get way too long.  But the cost/quality curve is also non linear.  You might get a head unit that is 5x better than the cheapest one for only 2 to 3x the cost, but after that, the next 10% increase in quality could cost you 10x as much.
I would also not waste money on a sub unless you listen to music that has low frequency tones.  Most music does not.  Music will a strong beat does not necessarily have a lower tone.  The beat is not the tone.  But if you do get a sub, it does not need to have a larger amp than the amps to the regular speakers,  if it is more powerful, it can also distort the sound.Needs are air,water, food, shelter, everything else is wants.I’m really confused (or I think you are). A CD or sub-woofer? These are two completely different components and have nothing to do with anything. Secondly - do you mean Head Unit that has a CD player? Never seen a head unit that’s just a CD.
You don’t need to spend a lot of money on a auto audio system to get good sound. As @Keith said…too much road noise to spend a lot of money on an expensive audio system.
Listen to @shadowfax Why are you going to a mechanic for car audio. If you want to do it yourself then check out Crutchfield. If not then find an audio installer. Even in my small town there are 4 within 10 miles of my house. I don’t know what your budget is, but you can get a decent system for under $500 installed…Depends on the bells and whistles you want.I think the OP is not in the US so wouldn’t Crutchfield have international shipping charges ?

The way that the OP phrased his query reminded me of an old (very old) joke from my high school days:
Do you walk to school, or do you carry your lunch?
I think that we need the OP to define his terminology for us.You sound like some old duffer. But I agree. I’m an old duffer too.The OP needs to visit an vehicle audio shop so he can hear and actually understand what each unit does . Plus it needs to be compatible with what ever phone he has.I think the ""CD""here is meant to be a head unit. And yes a new headunit could improve your driving and listening experience esp with bluetooth/etc. I have installed quite a few and they have always been an improvement on basic radios. You have to find the installation kit for your car to make it fit with the adapter for the wiring harness as you don’t want to splice into factory wire.
For those who think the car is not a nice place for music, you should sit in my Veloster with subwoofer and the dimension system. It is worlds different than what the basic radio would be.

No, I’m not from the U.S, in my country the mechanics are “all doing” meaning that they install also audio-related parts.
In “CD” I mean the radio unit, I’m not sure how to explain it otherwise? check the CD model that I’ve posted - "" Nakamichi NQ711B"" you’ll probably know what I mean by then haha.
But perhaps I haven’t explained my self good enough… I’ll try again
I bought new speakers for my car and want a good audio experience (bass, volume, etc…) I want to listen to music by connecting them to Spotify on my phone but since my CD doesn’t have an AUX input I can’t do that. So I need a new CD that has AUX, Bluetooth, and a mic (maybe some more useful features?) Anyway, as I understand it, the CD is only a mediator between my phone and the speakers? So if I have good speakers, having an expensive or a cheap CD won’t make a difference in sound quality? Overall the question is - do I need an expensive CD so I can get a good audio experience? If yes then what makes a good CD… good, so I’ll know what stats to look for?
My mechanic has advised me to get the UTE-200BT, he’ll take 215$ for it, installation included.
I can’t really find reviews of it… how do I know if it’s good? If it will maximize the potential of my speakers to their fullest?
what CDs do you recommend me buying so I can get a supreme sound quality? I love a strong bass and it needs to have AUX, Bluetooth, mic…
thanks for all the help!First of all you are not looking for CD .  Call it a Head unit or a radio with the features you want . Many new vehicles don’t come with CD players now .
It seems you will have the work done so try and find a shop that can let you hear what ever they want to sell .  Where ever this unknown country is .When you say “CD”. It sounds like you mean “Head Unit”   The head unit is the part of the system you interact with, it can have a radio/CD player/USB port/AUX input etc, on it.  Most modern head units don’t have CD players anymore, as most people use bluetooth or flash drives to play music.  I haven’t used a CD in about a decade.
When it comes to quality, you get what you pay for. The last vehicle I had that I did an extensive aftermarket system was my old Bronco.  This would’ve been back in the late 90’s/early 2000’s.  It replaced the factory head unit (AM/FM/tape player) with a Sony headunit that was AM/FM/CD.  I replaced the crap factory speakers with Infinite Kappas ( 6.5 inch 3 way in the front doors,  6x9 2 way in the back),  added a 4 channel 400W (I think) JL audio amp to feed the Kappas, which were very power-hungry speakers.  And added a subwoofer box in the cargo area with two JL Audio 10’s powered by a JL audio 2 channel amp which was on the order of 600 watts.
The results were impressive to 20 year old me.  However as I got older and more boring, having a banging sound system became less of a priority.  Though these days I’m tempted to do some more quality of life improvements to my Mustang. There’s certainly room for improvement, but I really like Sync 3 and would probably just replace the factory speakers and maybe do an inline amp, and possible a stealth box sub in the trunk.
Anyway,  a new modern head unit will probably get you some of the functionality you’re looking for (Bluetooth, USB, etc.) However a cheap head unit will not likely produce hugely better sound quality as cheap head units don’t always have noticeably more power (watts ) than a factory radio.   Peak wattage isn’t nearly as important as continuous (RMS) wattage.  Also different speakers respond better to differing amounts of power. The factory speakers almost certainly are made with lower power in mind, and they are likely of dubious quality.  Aftermarket speakers are almost always better in terms of quality, but some of the higher end ones only sound their best when they are being fed more power than a typical head unit can provide (this is where amplifiers come in). Of course there are also aftermarket speakers that are made to be powered by the head unit only as well.
Subwoofers, particularly ones that are mounted in the trunk/boot require some planning.  How many do you want/need?  What size?, How much power is it going to take?  Can you use the head unit to bypass certain frequencies?  Can the trunk/boot be effectively matted to keep unwanted/unsoundly vibrations in check?This is what I’d do.
#1 get a new head unit with a CD player (if you want). Features like Bluetooth and added microphone can make for a nicer driving experience because now you can do hands free driving. Also adding Apply CarPlay or Andriod Auto is a nice feature, especially for using GPS. A new head unit can improve the overall sound quality.
#2 If you think the system is lacking base then think about a woofer. It’s really a personal preference.

I bought new speakers for my car and want a good audio experience (bass, volume, etc…)


did you purchase good quality speakers?  If you spend go and spend a ton on a head unit and went cheap on speakers, it still won’t sound good- or won’t last long.
again, this is a lot about personal preference and wallet capabilities.  As others have said, go talk to an audio pro and see what they recommend.Here’s what I could find:

P0138- O2 Sensor Circuit High Voltage (Bank 1, Sensor 2).
He replaced the O2 sensor, the EFI relay, had the code cleared, and a less than 100 miles later the check engine light came back on- this time:
P0136- Oxygen Sensor Circuit Malfunction (Bank 1, Sensor 2.)  This code is currently active, and also pending.
This is when he called me, and I am a bit stumped- because as best as I can tell from my scanner, the o2 sensor is operating as it should. (this Toyota has an upstream Air/Fuel Ratio Sensor, and a downstream Oxygen Sensor)
the “book” says at steady, warmed up idle
-upstream sensor should read at 3.3volts.  I show 3.4volts
-downstream sensor should read between 100 mV and 1000mV.  I show about 800-900mV, with it decreasing as expected immediately after releasing the throttle and idle drops. After I goose the throttle and let off quick, it does drop below 100mV, but only for a second or two- then it climbs back up to 800-900mV.
-downstream sensor should read above 5 ohms.  I show over 5ohms constantly (usually somewhere around 200ohms)
-Fuel trims are good: usually about 5 numbers apart (ST reading about 0 to -2, LT reading around 3 or 4.)
I did a smoke test on the intake, and found no leaks.  I have done a visual on the exhaust, and didn’t see anything that looks like it’s a leak. Even thought the p0136 is active, there is no freeze frame data to be found, so I can’t see if I have an intermittent drop out of some of the readings.
I don’t deal much with gasoline emissions issues, and deal even less with Toyota’s (although my son did just buy one, lol, so it is in my future,) so any guidance/input/direction would be appreciated.


 Solved by Nevada_545 in post #4 


                That center point is too high, indicating that the fuel system is rich. 
Both P0136 and P0138 can be caused by a failing air/fuel sensor. Are the fuel trims out of the normal range?
              
That code P0136 code indicates it might be a bad harness or connector. Depending on the frame update rate of your scanner, you might not be seeing a drop-out or intermittent signal from the sensor. Maybe check the connector for corrosion and the wiring harness  for damage as a first step.I checked the connector (component and harness sides,) and didn’t see anything. All looked clean and shiny.  I will reverify.

225,2014 Kia Forte - is cold weather killing my battery?,Maintenance/Repairs,16,368,"In October 2019 I took my 2014 Kia Forte into Firestone to have them install a new battery.  It would seem that cold weather does not do well for the 2014 Forte.  Here I am again in December of 2020 the same thing is happening again, car battery goes dead.  I have turned everything off inside the car hoping this would keep the battery charged.  But it did not.  I am taking it back to Kia to have them check it out but I don’t want to be charged for them to tell me what is wrong . Has anyone else had this problem?Are you driving long enough to charge the battery, especially during this pandemic? If so, the next step is a battery and charging system test, then a parasitic draw test after that.
If this car isn’t under warranty, a good independent mechanic will probably be cheaper than the dealer and more knowledgeable than Firestone.


 Pam58:

I may be going out on a limb here, but I think that your 6 year old Kia has most likely passed the 60 month (5 year) limit on the Basic (Bumper-to-Bumper) Warranty.   If I am correct, the dealership will charge a diagnostic fee, as they would with all vehicles that are no longer covered by the warranty.Batteries do go bad unexpectedly and early. It happens.
The battery in my wife’s van died at just under 3 years old with no warning. Luckily it was still within the 3 year warranty, and I walked out of Walmart with a brand new one for no charge.It seems the first step would be to see if Firestone has a warranty on the battery . And they might be able to check the alternator also .  If that doesn’t solve anything then paying the dealer diagnostic fee is next.
While not a fan of franchise places like Firestone some of them can actually repair something .I just wanted say this I had the battery that came in the car for 5 years then it in 2019 in the winter time it would not start over and over. So I had a new one installed. So this would be the first replacement of the battery. I bought the car new in 2014 then in 2019 I have to replace the battery inconvenient the least. Now this year I have had to put it on a charger. I am charging it now.
I must say though I don’t drive it much, It has less than 15,000 on it. I would have thought the new battery would have lasted longer.
But then I must say, the charge I did 3 weeks ago I must not have let it charge long enough. This seems to happen in the winter time. I live in Pacific Northwest so it rains a lot and it can get cold( but then I get cold easy).
I am charging it again this time I will make sure the charger show 100%. Not sure it did last time.
I thank you so much for responding to my issue. If have any other ideas please feel free to contact me again.
Thank you for your thoughtfulness,
PamAfter the charge just try and take a 30 to 45 minute drive once a week for a while . If that solves the problem you might go 2 weeks between drives.  You just don’t drive enough to keep the battery charged it seems.Fifteen thousand miles in 6 years is enough to kill any battery. Sitting is the worst thing that can happen to a battery as it sulfates every minute it is not being charged.
Another possibility is that the car may have developed a parasitic draw. That means something is running the battery down no matter what you have turned off. That can easily be checked to determine if there is one. However, sometimes finding that draw can be a bit of a chore.
As for not wanting to be charged, good luck with that. Why should they work on it for free? Mechanics work on the flat rate pay system. If you do not get charged they do not get paid one dime.I think you misunderstood. I have the car for 6 years the battery that came with the car was 4 years old. The new got is only 1 year ole. But you are right about it setting for a time would not be good. But I am having Kia look at it on Thursday to see what is wrong. The reason for this that the battery is only 1 year old and has a warranty on it so I just want to have t checked out to see there is something else going on. It has been a very good car up until the started a year ago and then new battery stared to do the same thing. It happens only in the winter, do I will see what they have to say. I could take it somewhere else that will check things like alternator and anything electrical. But thank you for your thought I really appreciate it.That is what my husband has told me that I need to drive more. Lol
Once I can get fully charged as I am doing right now I will be drive t more and more to help with that.
Thanks for your input.
Pam


 Pam58:

For a replacement you need to go back to Firestone.
But do have a shop check it out. I’d avoid franchises like Firestone.
Once you get a new battery I suggest you charge it overnight once a month.
It would be good to charge at least a couple hours after the charger says 100%.
It takes time to thoroughly charge a car (lead-acid) battery.


 Pam58:

That is what my husband has told me that I need to drive more. Lol


Then why doesn’t he take it for a long drive or use it once in a while rather than just let it set.Hot weather kills batteries…or very very extreme cold (below -30). But normal winter temps we get in the North East actually preserves the battery. Batteries here in NH last 2-3 times longer then batteries do in Florida or Texas. But cold weather will show how weak your battery is.
Once a battery goes completely dead it shortens it’s life. If it keeps doing that then I’d suggest getting a new battery.


 Pam58:

I don’t understand your reluctance to take it to Firestone first.  At the minimum they can check your battery and alternator.  Whether or not they are sufficiently  competent to diagnose and track down parasitic drawn is anybody’s guess.
After that then Kia or an independent shop.  Either will charge you a diagnostic fee.Purebred’s advice is very good, and I hope that the OP follows it.Well, He is a big guy and he doesn’t fit in my Kia Forte.Could there be a power draw when shut down, perhaps a loos connection or something?",,,,
226,2020 Toyota Highlander - Hard seats,Maintenance/Repairs,8,324,"The  driver seat in the 2020 Toyota Highlander is very uncomfortable.  My right leg goes numb after one hour.  I have put it in several different positions.  I am going to buy a pad for the seat.  Why are they making these so hard??Didn’t you try the vehicule before you bought it?Test drove for 45 min.See if this helps.



 COROLLAGUY1:

Didn’t you try the vehicule before you bought it?


Exactly. Why would anyone buy a vehicle that is uncomfortable?
I have a 2014 Highlander…Not sure what changed between mine and 2020 model year…but my Highlander is very comfortable.Have you adjusted the seat up and down to be more comfortable?  These days, manufacturers have power seats that go up, down, forward, back, and even change angle. Maybe a combination you haven’t tried will work better. It seems from your description, adjusting lower might help if you haven’t done that already.
They design their vehicles to appeal to the largest number of people. The only way to know for sure is to go for a long test drive, at least 20 minutes. I had a similar issue in 2017. I test drove a Toyota Avalon, and ended up going for a half hour test drive. Turns out I find the seat back uncomfortable, and I only discovered that after the long drive. More recently, I had a Camry rental with a similarly designed seat, and it was uncomfortable in the same way. Lots of people think those seats are comfortable, but the just don’t fit me. Good luck with your quest.I have driven a lot of different vehicle 's  over the year’s and I know with most cars now it can’t be done but to me the most comfortable seat’s was the bench seat and the air ride seat that was in most truck’s.It seems like most seats now are a bit on the firm side and I dislike them also. However, I notice hard seats in about 10 seconds so there is no acclimation period.
The only car I’ve owned with what I consider perfect seats is my Lincoln Mark. I’ve driven that car non-stop several times for 425 miles with no comfort issues at all.Seat comfort is really subjective.  We have  2003 Toyota 4Runner.  The seats are firm and the ride is stiff.  For riding around town, the 4Runner had the riding comfort of a wheelbarrow.  Yet, it is one of the most comfortable vehicles I have owned for long trips.  I can drive the 375 miles to visit our son and not feel stiff when we arrive.  On the other hand, we had a 1993 Oldsmobile 88 with all the bells and whistles.  It felt very comfortable for local driving, but after an hour on the highway, my legs would cramp up.  Even with the power seats that adjusted in all kinds of positions, I was never comfortable after an hour on the road.
We owned a 2006 Chevrolet Uplander minivan.  It was the lowest trim line model.  It didn’t have power seats.  Yet, it was quite comfortable to drive.  The seat and driving position are more comfortable than the 2011 Toyota Sienna that replaced the Uplander.  Our son now has both the 2006 Uplander and the 2011 Sienna and he thinks the seats are more comfortable in the Uplander than the Sienna.  As well as the 4Runner, we have a 2017 Toyota Sienna.  It is no different than the 2011 Sienna.  For me, it was the most comfortable minivan I could find since GM no longer makes a minivan.
I think the vehicle I owned that had the most comfortable seat was the 1990.Ford Aerostar Eddie Bauer.  I still wish I could get a new minivan like that Aerostar.  I liked the rear wheel drive and full frame construction for pulling trailers.",,,,

229,Does motor oil break down over time with little mileage or engine hours?,Maintenance/Repairs,30,61.3k,"I have a 2010 Silverado with less than 3500 miles and is now a year old. On Star says I need to change the the oil now. Is it really needed? I also have a tractor with low hours and the oil is several years old (same type question).Yes, the GM oil life monitor puts the various factors in to estimate oil life.  I’d follow it.  And ‘several years’ is too long for me. Once a year is my maximum time.  What does the tractor owners manual say.It’s not a question of the oil breaking down in 3,500 miles/1 year.
Instead it is a matter of the oil likely being diluted by water vapor (a normal byproduct of combustion), as well as the potential for oil sludging to take place.
The problem with a vehicle that logs only 3,500 miles in 1 year is that–in most cases–those miles are accumulated mostly with short-distance local driving.    That type of driving does not allow the engine and the oil to become hot enough to evaporate the water vapor, and the oil becomes diluted over time.
The process of dilution of the oil, coupled with an engine running on a richer than normal mixture when it is not fully warmed-up, can create the perfect storm for the formation of sludge, internal corrosion,  and resulting engine damage.
Normally, I don’t trust the automated oil life monitors on cars to tell me when to change the oil, but in this case, I would suggest that you take its notification very seriously.   Even if you are skeptical of an oil change being necessary at this point, the reality that you will void the warranty on your engine by failing to change the oil on the recommended schedule should prod you into action.If you look in your owner’s manual you will see that GM advises an oil change when the monitor specifies and at least once per year.  I can’t say how oil in your little used engine deteriorates but once per year is a tolerable expense.  If you made only a few long trips to total 3500 miles, your oil might be ok and you could stretch the change interval to two years.  The small savings, however, is not worth encountering the possibility of subtracting from the far end of your engine’s lifespan.No, oil does not break down just by sitting in your crankcase.  But you have been given a number of reasons favoring an annual oil change nevertheless.  A change may not be totally necessary at this time but it is a sensible precaution.It’s unanimous. It should be changed.
As others said, the oil itself doesn’t technically “break down”, but there are very good reasons to change it anyway.
I’d change the tractor oil annually too. Engines…and tractors…are expensive. Oil is cheap. Oil is an engine’s lifeblood. Kept fresh it can do a much better job.I agree with all of the above.I used to have a car that I drove about the same 3,500 miles per year as you.  I changed its oil once a year, despite the fact that the specified oil change interval, in miles, was 7,500.
I don’t agree that oil should be changed every six months on low mileage vehicles, but I can’t see leaving it unchanged for more than a year.  The reasons why have already been listed by others.My mechanic for our low-mileage classic says the oil should be changed at least every six months any time after the car is driven, since some of the additives added by the manufacturer will probably be less effective after six months once they are exposed to engine operating stresses.  Modern oils are quite good and it’s not like the oil is going to suddenly change into mush after six  months, but you are stacking the odds in your favor, and an oil change is relatively inexpensive.
Unlike modern oil, modern ethanol-based fuel is worse than it used to be and that may be even more of a problem for cars which are not driven very often.I drive my car about 4000 miles a year. Driven 2-3 times a week
The Operator’s Manual says change the oil every 6 months or 5000 miles.
So I change it every 6 months.
However, I change the oil filter once a year.
I don’t think water and unburned fuel get trapped in the filter.Motor Oil seldom if ever “breaks down”…It’s very stable and retains its properties for a long time. What happens to Motor Oil is that it becomes CONTAMINATED with the by-products of combustion…This contamination can lead to sludging and the corrosion of internal engine parts…
While Motor Oil is no longer cheap, it’s still a lot cheaper than rebuilding engines…""Motor Oil seldom if ever “breaks down”
Oil definitely does break down…Ever see an engine with Sludge in it?? That’s the result of the oil breaking down…NOT Contaminates…
All oil…after time (even synthetic) will break down.

Engine Sludge: When Good Oil Goes Bad 150
Nasty oil residue can build up inside engines, especially if owners neglect maintenance.








Engine Builder Magazine – 1 Sep 01 43



Engine Sludge Origins 43
Fresh engine oil is a clear, free-flowing liquid blend of base stock and additives that contains no fuel, water, coolant, dirt, or other contaminants.   When regular engine oil changes...





Transmission oil and other gear-box lubricants can perform for YEARS, operating at high temperatures, WITHOUT “breaking down”…They remain serviceable because they are uncontaminated by combustion byproducts…
“Sludge” in crankcases results from water-vapor collecting in oil or from the oil being partially BURNED by collecting in pockets, hot-spots on top of the head with very little oil circulation and temperatures over 350 degrees…You can call that “breakdown” if you like…I call it poor engine design…Failure to change engine oil in a timely manner compounds these problems because the oil becomes so contaminated with combustion products it can no longer hold them in suspension…
""The Story Of Why Engine Oil Becomes Engine Sludge
By Don Fedak
Fresh engine oil is a clear, free-flowing liquid blend of base stock and additives that contains no fuel, water, coolant, dirt, or other contaminants. In engines that have failed prematurely, the oil has very often been transformed into a high viscosity deposit of brown or black goo, commonly referred to as “sludge.”
When regular engine oil changes are neglected, normally free-flowing lubricating oil breaks down, becomes contaminated, ceases to flow, and is transformed into a thick soup of waste products. That’s when serious engine damage is imminent.""
This writer feels that “breakdown” and “contaminated” are the same thing. They are not…
Way back, when multi-viscosity motor oil was first being developed, the “viscosity index improver” which transformed 5 weight oil into 10W-30 oil would indeed breakdown in a process called “shear stability” or lack thereof…These problems have been solved long ago and viscosity stability is no longer an issue…I took some time to do a search on the subject and discovered that oil compabies recommend a maximum of 5 years as a shelf life for unopened motor oils, including synthetics. I was unfortunately unable to find anything on the reasons. The American Petrolium Institute (API.org 3) site has standards established, but I was unable to find the one for motor oil shelf life.
In short, it appears that even unopened oil experiences changes over time. While I’d guess the changes had to do with stratification over time due to different specific graties of the oil’s component elements, I was unable to find anything definitive.“This writer feels that “breakdown” and “contaminated” are the same thing. They are not…”
I didn’t read that…
The writer did make the statement that as the oil breaks down it becomes more contaminated…That’s true…but he never said they are the same.
Want to create sludge…Pour oil into a frying pan…put on stove and turn on high…In about 10 minutes or so you’ll have sludge…no water needed.With that kind of mileage I would change it every 6 months at the latest. That type of driving can easily contribute to oil sludging.
Caddyman is correct about the cause of oil sludging. Often this is something that worsens progressively due to the crankcase ventilation system.
Car owner does not have PCV system serviced for whatever reason (how many actually do), oil is contaminated more, PCV system clogs even more, oil is contaminated even faster, PCV…yada, yada, yada.
As the VW service people explained to me at a school one time, engine oil (like transmission fluid or power steering fluid) does not break down. The additives in the oil or fluid do break down an contamination (not related to additive breakdown) can occur.
Place a spoon of tap water into a pan of fresh motor oil and allow it to sit for a few weeks to see what happens.OK…maybe we’re all just saying the same thing, but differently.
Oil DOES break-down…And when it does break-down it produces contaminates that will turn the oil into sludge.
Water or other contaminates in the oil will also turn the oil into sludge.Today, the plastic bottles they package oil in will break down before the oil inside will…The oil itself is about 10 million years old when you buy it…Yea…but that 10 million year old oil is NOT the same as when it’s brought up from the ground…it goes through a lot of processing.
I just posted this in another thread…Back in the 70’s we started seeing a lot of vehicles with sludge problems…Mainly due to Unleaded gas and their higher temps…Some oils handled the higher temps…others didn’t (like quakerstate).ALL engines, WAY before 1970, had sludging problems if they were neglected…
“Kendal, the 2000 mile motor oil”  This was a big step up from the normal 1000 mile service intervals common up until 1950…

233,Too much rust on exhaust manifold?,Maintenance/Repairs,5,360,"Pics:   https://stellar7.org/05civic/ 29
Hey guys, I have a 2005 Honda Civic VP (same as LX) with around 115k.  It’s my go to work vehicle and has been excellent.  I suspected a head gasket minor leak and as I took the head off the block, I noticed the exhaust manifold is super rusted near the mating surface with the block.  Please see the pics.  https://stellar7.org/05civic/ 29       I’m not a professional mechanic so I have no experience to judge how bad it is.  I can see carbon buildup around the duct perimeters and a bit further in the case of the outer 2 ducts.  Looking at the pic of the front of the manifold, I don’t see any obvious metal fatigue failure.
I’ve heard that these manifolds have a manufacturer defect where they crack in the center outer part of the ducts and the mating surface bows. Based on the photos, it appears the outer ducts may be sealing less?
Is the amount of rust on the mating surface too much to seal properly with a new gasket?  Can it be sanded down?  I doesn’t appear the mating surface was designed to be completely flat… there is a rectangular area in the center that protrudes the main surface…  I wonder if sanding that part down is inconsequential?
Are there any tolerances on curvature like there is on the head?
Any advice is appreciated.Don’t be too agressive when cleaning it up
this might be sufficient
image960×512 65.4 KB
you clearly need to remove any rust that is loose and flaking off, but not so much “good” metal that it won’t seal up
After cleaning it up, you can throw a straightedge on it and give us a few figures, if you like.  For example, see what the fattest feeler gauge you can slide in between the straightedge and the manifold assembly.  But I wouldn’t go out and buy a straightedge, if you don’t already possess oneDoesn’t look that bad to me. As long as there aren’t chunks coming off I’d probably slap it back on the car with a new gasket. Exhaust gaskets are squishy, so they’ll conform to ripples in the mating surface.
That header is made out of cast iron, and that stuff rusts at the drop of a hat, so seeing rust there is not at all surprising. The tolerances are basically “Is it leaking? If not, it’s fine.” Most exhaust manifolds look a lot worse than that after  5 or 6 years  .   Just get the loose stuff  off with a brush  and be happy you were able to get the studs off , LOL .OEM exhaust manifolds are usually very thick cast metal. It would take decades for any rust to cause a problem. Clean it up…And paint it if you want. Make sure to use high-temp paint.Doesn’t look particularly bad or anything to me.  Cast iron is gonna rust.  If you want you can get a metal wire brush and see if you can get some the mating surfaces cleaned up a bit. Or you can get stainless steel header and call it good.",,,,

Oh you make me laugh.  Not a new owner but the gospel truth.  I was fiddling with the radio in the Acura trying to get something worthwhile on, (AM, FM, Sat. and probably 250 combinations) no traffic, Sunday morn., 150 miles to go, and an 8 lane Indianapolis road, all the while stepping on the gas a little harder, and not paying attention as I zoomed by a state trooper.

Back in the late '90s, I ran into a traffic jam on the Garden State Parkway, on my way to work.  I rarely used my cell phone, but I decided to call my department head to report that I would likely be a little late.    Suddenly, the traffic began to move, and while I was still focused on my phone call, I drove right past my exit.
I had to drive several miles North, turn around,  and head back South to my exit.   I wound-up arriving only ~10 minutes late, but the bottom line is that if I hadn’t been distracted by my cell phone use, I would have arrived at work on time.
Prior to that incident, I had been skeptical about the issue of being distracted by cell phone use in the car, but this situation proved to me that it really does happen.Lol, I was driving north on I-75, while changing radio stations missed the I-10 west turnoff, didn’t realize it until I saw the Welcome to Georgia sign.
In my defense this was before radio controls on the steering wheel and pre-GPS.

235,Subaru misfire,Maintenance/Repairs,17,2.6k,"2002 Subaru Impreza RS 78,800 miles
 Codes:  P0304 and P0302. Many times these have occurred. Have replaced plugs/wires couple times, front o2 sensor twice, and had tune-ups. Changed valve cover gasket?due to leakage.
 Codes: P0328, P1518, P0172, P0302/P0304, P1398, and P1134.  For these, the Knock Sensor was replaced.
 I have had an ongoing misfire problem with my car for years now. The mechanics are failing to fix the problem.
 The majority of misfires happen when starting from stop in 1st gear, and when shifting from 3rd to 4th gear. I have also noticed a lack of acceleration at times. Sometimes, upon initial start-up, the car idles extremely rough and can idle out (shut off).
 I do know the clutch is showing signs of slippage (at least I think).  The dealership tried to readjust my valves somehow once, but I know very little of that.
 What do you all think?
The lack of acceleration can be explained like this.
In a manual transmission, I was previously able to ride in second gear and step on the gas and be thrown back in my seat. NOW, I do that and the car seems to bog down and accelerate at a slow rate of speed. Once I hit about 3.5k RPM then it tends to pick up normal acceleration. Doesn’t happen but 45% of the time or so./bump
A recent talk with a mechanic indicated a rare problem. He said it could be the valve guide. What is a valve guide? Is this relevant?JMHO, but any time a vehicle is in a shop for an engine performance problem and the spark plugs are out a compression test is a given. At 78k miles a mechanical problem should not be present but certainly can be.
This would be especially true based on the comment about “tried to readjust valves” and the valve guide comment. I don’t see a valve guide being at fault but a tight valve lash adjustment could be.
The easiest thing to do right now (and far easier than pulling the plugs and running a compression test) would be to simply connect a vacuum gauge to the intake manifold and see what’s going on. If the guage shows an oddball reading then a compression test should follow.
Unfortunately, it seems many mechanics do not use a vacuum gauge or even care but it’s a great place to start and if you do have a problem with compression due to valve lash the vac. gauge will show it.
There’s a number of things it could be but a vacuum gauge and/or comp. test should be step 1. It’s easier to weed problems with the mechanical end of things out before throwing cases of replacement parts at it.
(As I mentioned, 78k miles it young for a mechanical problem but we had a Subaru in the shop once in which both cylinder heads were trashed, and not even repairable, due to tight valve lash. And this car had a whopping 7k miles on it.)You are in need of a good mechanic. One who knows how to troubleshoot a problem, instead of throwing parts at the problem. Ask around for such a mechanic. There are a few available.
Besides the vacuum gauge checks, I see a need to look at the performance of several sensors, and control valves, with a quality scan tool. In particular, the tps (throttle position sensor), iac (idle air control) valve, and the MAF (Mass Air Flow) sensor need examining.
Let’s not forget the performance of the fuel pump, after a fresh fuel filter has been installed.I am suprised Subaru engines still require manual valve adjustments? Not on the leading edge of technology.It’s not just Subaru. There are others; the Honda CRV for example.
The issue I always have with mechanical lifter engines is not the design but the recommendations by the factories that valve lash can be ignored for 100k miles plus before even inspecting the lash. It’s certainly not the car owners fault if a problem develops prematurely.
The majority of car owners will get lucky and survive this but there’s going to be a percentage of them who are going to suffer valve and cylinder head damage (too tight) or camshaft/lifter/cam follower damage (too loose).
With the 7000 mile Subaru I mentioned the valve lash was too tight on 3 out of 4 cylinders and this led to such severe valve seat burning the heads were nothing more than scrap aluminum.Noobie,
Find a qualified mechanic to do a leak down test, compression test, and coolant “exhaust gas” test.  I suspect, like other Subaru engines of this age group, you have a failing head gasket.  This condition will cause symptom codes such as a misfire.  I recently spent quite a bit of time troubleshooting this with OBD scanners and test equipment on my sister-in-law’s Subaru and discovered a leaking head gasket.  (To the outside thankfully).  Find a different dealer.  Some Subarus are actually covered under a “silent warranty” fix-- if they determine that you didn’t abuse the car and it was maintained under their service campaigns.  Good luck.
-MattThank you for the tip. I will let the mechanic know.
I have it at a good mechanic now, and I can’t get the thing to misfire right now. Some days it is really bad, others it runs quite well. It is realy frustrating.Sometimes this kind of problem has been solved by replacing the cam angle sensor.Well, I had the valves adjusted…and it fixed my hesitation problem.
The car ran great for about 2 weeks, now it is acting up again. I am wondering if it can be 3 things(through my own research)?

Catalytic Converter
Timing
The actual computer of the car.

Also, I know I need a new clutch (due to some slippage), but I don’t think this has anything to do w/ misfires.I have been battling misfire codes on random cylinders since I replaced the long block, 2 1/2 years ago.  The only reason that I am working solving it is for emissions.  If I can keep the light off long enough to pass emission, then I am done.  In the meantime, I have a new coil, new plugs that I gapped myslf, new Spark plug wires are coming, and I replaced the Cat and o2 sensors two years ago, a month after the engine rebuild.  I cannot find mechanic with common sense to get to the heart of the problem, and I am no longer willing to drop a bunch of dollars on my 2003 Impreza Outback 5 speed.  I have kept it because it has a manual transmission, and a Six Star engine.  I will never buy another Subaru, not even new.  Too many stupid design choices, Cowardly supplier management and it is too noisy.  I just need to get 30 more miles on, so everything resets, and I can pass emissions.  Two years from now, it will be gone. I will send it to an enemy.I think you may be a bit too harsh on Subarus. You say you replaced the long block 2.5 years ago.
When this is done valve lash should be checked at that time AND again after a short run-in period. Say a few thousand miles. Who did the work and was this lash procedure done or not?
Read my above posts on valve lash issues. I suggest you buy a vacuum gauge. They can be had cheap at Harbor Freight for 15 bucks or 25 at Auto Zone. Easy to connect and will tell you something instantly. At idle the gauge should show a reading of 20"" of mercury give or take a bit. Unless you live at high altitude. The gauge needle should be rock steady. If there is a compression issue/valve lash issue it will be noticeable on the gauge.Random misfire codes P0300?  I would look at the crankshaft position sensor and the belt/chain tensioner.  If you are randomly getting misfire codes for specific cylinders P0301-P0306, then I’d certainly check those valves.@NYBo It was flagged and I agreed, because it didn’t add anything to the discussion other than to jab the new poster for adding a new post to an old thread. It’s come up a bunch of times before (I’m recalling your posting the Holy Thread Resurrection meme) and Discourse doesn’t have the feature to close threads, with the idea that people * should * come back and keep discussions alive.The new poster came cack after 7 years of inactivity to flame a manufacturer. Not exactly a useful contribution to an ancient topic.I agree with NYBo. It was also bashing a car manufacturer over an engine that the car maker (Subaru) had nothing to do with during this episode.
If it were me I’d run a compression test (dry and wet if need be) as a first step depending upon what a vacuum gauge showed. If the vacuum gauge and/or compression test shows a problem then the complaint should be against the people who rebuilt that engine which was Six Star.
Subaru did not do the rebuild and their fingerprints are nowhere on it,
Right now this is akin to someone’s LG refrigerator breaking down, being repaired by a local independent shop, and then blaming LG for any subsequent problems.You complained about the age of the thread, offered nothing to solve the misfire problem and did not defend the manufactures problems.

236,2013 Hyundai Elantra - Engine Misfires/Bad Idling,Maintenance/Repairs,16,696,"2013 Hyundai Elantra Limited, with 164k miles, 1.8 L 4-cyl engine.
I was told by the previous car owner that it was misfiring, and needed replacement spark plugs. Without really checking, I got four new plugs. I pulled out the old plugs, and they were all iridium. All looked fine except 1 which was covered in black carbon build-up. I replaced them anyway.
10 miles later, the car is misfiring again, especially near idle. Especially as the car warms up or idles a while.
It will idle at 900 on cold-start, down to 750rpms, then once it warms up more, start dropping as low as 400rpms, up to 1100 and down and up again, repeatedly, while misfiring. Also misfires (putt-putt effect) from around 750rpms up to ~2,000 rpms until it gets above 2,000 and then seems to smooth out.
The engine seems to shake and the car vibrates pretty strongly, but it comes and goes and doesn’t always vibrate.
A final possible factor: The car was sitting for around 6 to 8 weeks, until the owner sold it to me. It had 4 gallons of old gas in it. I filled it with 8 more gallons of new gas.
I have also recently replaced oil with 5W20 synthetic, and done a brake job on all four tires.

To start with, never buy a car that just needs a cheap and easy fix.   If there was a cheap and easy fix, the previous owner would have done it before he sold it.
Is the check engine light on?  If it isn’t, does it light up when you turn the ignition of without starting the engine.  The check engine light is designed to tell you what system is having abnormal readings.
Change the ignition coil from the sooty cylinder to a different cylinder. Does the misfire move with it.  If yes, replace that coil.  If not run a dry and wet compression check.First, I appreciate the fast answer.
“Never buy a car that needs a cheap and easy fix”
Understood. In this case, it was a friend letting me have the car, so I can start working, and I will pay him back once I have income. He said he expected repairs to be around $1000 and lowered his price to $2000.
“Is the check engine light on?”
Yes. I haven’t gotten up to Autozone yet to get the codes.
“Change the ignition coil from the sooty cylinder to a different cylinder. Does the misfire move with it. If yes, replace that coil. If not run a dry and wet compression check.”
Can move the ignition coil by myself, I believe. The dry and wet compression check… Can I borrow a compression test kit from a shop? I watched a video on Youtube. Near the edge of what I can do from watching a video, I’m guessing.See if Advance or Autozone have a compression tester in their free tool loaner program.  Don’t forget to prop the throttle open.  Running a compression check is a piece of cake compared to replacing a head.Will try swapping the coil first. If that doesn’t work, compression tester I will move to next. Will update with results. Thanks, sir.Update:
Used OBD scan tool. Fault codes detected before swapping ignition coils #2 and 3:
P0303 - Cylinder 3 Misfire Detected
P0106 - Manifold Absolute Pressure/Barometric Pressure Circuit Range/Performance Problem
After swapping ignition coil #2 and 3, car didn’t start on first turn of the key. Turned again and held a little and after 2 or so seconds it started, but was not running well. The fault codes detected after restarting the engine (I did not clear the codes):
P0303 - Cylinder 3 Misfire Detected
P0106 - Manifold Absolute Pressure/Barometric Pressure Circuit Range/Performance Problem
P0302 - Cylinder 2 Misfire Detected
B2aaa - Unknown code - More information may be available on web
So it sounds like bad ignition coil. Ordering a Denso 673-8305 Ignition coil, which is the OEM part.
What about the other codes? How can I clean out cylinder 3 effectively but also hopefully inexpensively?P0106 could be a vacuum leak or a bad MAF sensor. Do a visual inspection for possible vacuum leaks.I will have a friend who knows more help me look for vacuum leaks, but the engine bay looks in very good shape.
Thanks for info.


 j.cogitation_172512:

P0106 - Manifold Absolute Pressure/Barometric Pressure Circuit Range/Performance Problem


The misfire is causing low engine manifold vacuum, the MAP input to the computer is abnormal and considered out of range.
After repairing the misfire, P0106 should not return.Clean or replace the plug in cylinder 3 also.So, Update 2:
The bad ignition coil was replaced. I pulled the autolite plug from cylinder 3. Was clean as a whistle. I put the NGK plug in anyway, per recommendations.
Car started up fine, but idled up at 1500 rpms, and had a slight tick at around ~5 Hz, but on a friend with some experience’s recommendation, I drove it around for about 45 minutes on the highway.
Tick gone, misfire gone, idling at 600rpms, smooth, and check engine light off.
My friend thought he had a compression tester kit to bring with him, but he couldn’t find it. Is it very important to have that done still? I plan on replacing with the new NGK plugs within a week or so, per everyone’s recommendations, but can’t do that immediately.If the car is running normally I wouldn’t worry about a compression test. That was only if the coil wasn’t the problem. Glad to hear you got the issue solved.Old school a miss fire ment spark plug, or coil now days with fuel injection a miss fire most likely a injector is leaking or not working properly, switching coil packs may help ID which cylinder, injectors testing is best I found one company out of  AZ which make sure your new injectors have bal pressure by matching  OMS reading.I’ve never worked on a Hyundai, but on my 2002 Mazda Miata I had a similar experience with a misfire.  After going through all the diagnostics you have been discussing, and more, I finally was told to check the valve lash (the maximum space between the cam lobes and the valves).  The lash was tight on every exhaust valve.  I fixed that and when I buttoned up the engine and started it the first time,  I knew that the problem was solved.  The engine started fast and run so much better, it was shocking.  The check engine light never went on again, fuel mileage went up, and happiness filled the garage.  So that’s my suggestion.


 wentwest:

With my 4 previous Hondas ('75 Civic, '81, '85, '88 Accords) adjusting valve lash was THE most satisfying DIY maintenance for me.American designed engines (with a couple exceptions) have been using hydraulic valve lash adjustment since world war 2. Why do Honda and some other companies persist in using an antiquated system requiring periodic adjustment?Nissan does it, too.  I suspect there’s some performance reason, but maybe it’s just cheap.  Anyway, it’s not a fun job but it sure made a difference.",,,,

That may very well turn out to be true, but the OP would be foolish to start the diagnosis/repair process with anyone other than the dealership.   Maybe he will luck-out and it will turn out to be a warranty-covered issue.I didn’t say the OP shouldn’t take it to the dealer, only that it’s unlikely to be a warranty repair.

B) Transmission Only Shop

Im just sick of throwing money at guesses. I want to take it to sombody who will know EXACTLY what is going on with the car so I can financially plan accordingly.A) Well-rated, independent auto repair shop is usually your best bet. There are exceptions depending on the actual problem (you don’t fully explain)
C) Dealer may be a bit more expensive to diagnose and repair the problem but they generally know your car better, especially if it is pretty new (you don’t say)
B) Transmission shop is the worst because EVERYthing looks like a transmission issue to them.
Expect to pay the mechanic for their time for a proper diagnosis. It is well worth the time and money. Your doctor won’t diagnose you for free, don’t expect a mechanic to do it for free either.
Be prepared for the best educated guess if the problem cannot be absolutely determined without some disassembly and very many can’t. Even with the best shops there is no guarantee of immediate success especially for intermittent problems (you didn’t say if yours was intermittent).

While driving between 1500-2000 rpm the car vibrates in short bursts. Above 50mph/2000rpm the car drives great. Smooth sailing. So should I A, B or C for something like this??Well an MD is going to be more expensive than a PA or a nurse, so which would you go to?  You pay for expertise so you can’t expect the most expertise for less money.
On this particular issue though, you need someone skilled that will drive the car with the computers attached to try to figure out what is happening.  I think that level of attention is more likely in a good quality private shop than a dealer.  At a dealer you might have trouble getting past the service writer but in a private shop the owner might be the one doing the diagnosis.This may not be a a cut and dry problem to solve. It might take more than one diagnosis, and therefore, fee, to determine the problem.
Just be prepared for that. Hopefully, with luck, you’ll find a sharp mechanic who can nail the problem on the first try.
I’d also try a local repair shop too.Agree with @Bing… You need a mechanic to ride or drive the car while reading his scanner to capture the problem. A is still the best answer.50 mph/2k rpm. So you are in 4th gear? Or 5th?
With very light throttle, you might even be in 6th?
4th is 0.98 5th is .76 and 6th is .66.When out of town I call a NAPA shop for a mechanic recommendation giving them as much info as I can about the problem.The most reasonable price would almost surely be from an indy mechanic, but I’m really curious about why the OP believes that an apparent engine problem should be diagnosed by a transmission specialist.
Is there evidence of the transmission slipping?
Is the trans fluid dark and/or burnt-smelling?
Has the trans of this mystery-year Toyota been serviced every 3-4 years?I believe it starts happening in 3rd gear. The 2011 Camry LE 2.5L L4 has Manual AND Automatic shifting. The vibration happens in both modes. But the vibration only happens when the car reaches operating temperature. The vibration wont happen on a cold start and drive. The vibration/hesitation will stop after 50mph/2000rpm. At idle its normal.


 Bing:

Well an MD is going to be more expensive than a PA or a nurse, so which would you go to? You pay for expertise so you can’t expect the most expertise for less money.


I’d trust a CRNP who’s been a nurse for 20+ years before an MD who’s in his residency personally. And your copay doesn’t change based on who you see anyway.
@ArgosNoble I agree with everyone else, take it to a well-rated independent mechanic. I’m not convinced that it’s a transmission issue.Thank You! I will do that.


 Mustangman:

C) Dealer may be a bit more expensive to diagnose and repair the problem but they generally know your car better, especially if it is pretty new (you don’t say)


I’ll mildly disagree with that one just based on my experience with dealerships of several makes. I’ve had more misdiagnoses/failure to find the problem from dealerships than I ever had from independent mechanics. To the point that I only take cars that are under warranty to the dealership except for timing belt jobs (which I only take to the dealership because they have more money and can source engines for cost, so if the job gets screwed up I might be more likely to get a replacement engine without having to take anyone to court).
One problem with the dealership is that it’s often difficult to talk to the mechanic who’s working on your car. Instead you’re talking to a service adviser, which is a salesperson who may or may not know how to even change a tire, much less fix a car. Then the SA writes down what he thinks you said and tells the mechanic, and you just have to hope this little game of telephone with an intermediary who isn’t a mechanic managed to get the message across just so the mechanic even knows what he’s looking for.Our mechanics use the dealer when they can’t figure out a problem, the dealer has not failed us yet. Sure there are good ones and bad ones, guess we have a good one.My thoughts with that suggestion was if the car was a modern car 4 years old out of warranty with more complicated computer and network systems. But I can understand your experiences with dealers. Mine have been mixed. Some good, some not.Dealer service departments are no different than any other business–some are run well and some aren’t. There is an advantage that the dealer has in that they are required to have all technical equipment and information resources to fix their lines of car. But having a mechanic experienced and willing to use all the resources is a different question.



 ArgosNoble:

Im just sick of throwing money at guesses. I want to take it to sombody who will know EXACTLY what is going on with the car so I can financially plan accordingly.


If that’s the case the question should be which shop will do that and not the “Who’s going to charge me more?” that you ask in the title of your post. Why is the cost the first question you ask if you’re interested more in the quality of the work?
There’s a shop around the corner that advertises free check engine light diagnosis. We charge $160. Which shop would you go to?I bet OP will go to free shop.For the record… There are mechanics who absolutely rip people off so me trying to save money is the motive for avoiding mechanics who rip people off. I would definiately pay a mechanic for their time and expertise. Paying is not the issue. Overpaying is a huge problem. Some mechanics (not all) have done some unecessary sh*t to squeez more money out of unsuspecting customers. If you are a mechanic on this forum, you know what I say is true. You’ve met those ***holes. Don’t act like the problem doesnt exist.Yes, there are some crooks out there and I’ve worked (briefly) with a few of them. However, the mechanics I know do not want to work around crooks as they do not want to be associated in any way, shape, or form with the dishonest ones. The distinct minority taints the majority.
That being said, I figure the number of crooked mechanics percentage wise is the same as the number of crooked customers percentage wise. Mechanics know what I’m referring to here…Consider consulting Car Talk’s “Mechanics Files” for local recommendations by customers  - click on “Repair Shops” in the menu at the top of this website).  I generally concur with their ratings of our local shops and have found them useful during out of town emergencies.
Dealerships vary considerably and some are quite good.   However in my experience many (but not all) dealerships automatically charge additionally for their computer scan whereas some (not all) independent shops waive that fee if they end up doing the repair.  By checking up front that’s one item where you might save ~ $100 without compromising quality.
As other posters have indicated, don’t automatically assume it’s a transmission problem although it might be.  A son’s car had a problem that seemed like the transmission but was solved by replacing some fuel/air management components indicated by a computer scan.  There’s no harm in first going to a place that performs simple scans for free, such as some auto parts stores, just don’t assume those scans will tell the whole story.",,,,
239,"Piston rings, valve guides or what?",Maintenance/Repairs,17,469,"2003 ford focus 2.3l, 5 speed manual with about 146k on it. I pulled the head after the misfire was diagnosed as a blown head gasket, which it was not and found an exhaust valve cracked. I replaced it, all seals and gaskets and when I fired it up it still has the misfire and oil on top of the #3 piston. I will do a compression test but want to know what it could be IE valve guides, rings, something else?100_17594288×3216 2.7 MB

please give us the numbers, if you do indeed perform those testsI will perform a wet and dry test soonish. The leak down test may not happen. If I hadn’t just put brand new valve stem seals in then I would agree granted, that doesn’t mean I didn’t damage them putting them in.Those cylinder walls do not look too good and in all honesty a dry/wet compression test should have been done before tearing into it regardless of the alleged bad head gasket diagnosis.
Sounds like a ring issue to me.A shop did a compression test and diagnosed it as a bad head gasket. I trusted that determination but now doubt everything they have done or told me.So I put conventional oil in it so hopefully I could see smoke, well I did, a bunch on start up and puffs while running. The compression test is as follows #1 194, #2 195, #3 92, #4 192. Wet #3 94. Note: each cylinders pressure went up by about 30psi every revolution until they hit their peak.The 190s are fine. The No. 3 cylinder shows a valve problem. Whenever a cylinder head is off the valve should be leak tested no matter the reason for the head removal.
This is done by filling the combustion chamber with liquid (I use mineral spirits) and allowed to sit for a short time. If the fluid level goes down in say 5 or 10 minutes that means a valve job should be performed or the head replaced. The leaking fluid will dribble down through the intake or exhaust ports; or both.
You say you found a cracked exhaust valve and replaced it. I assume this means the compression is still way low even after that? If so, were the other valves checked and was the new valve lapped in properly?Exactly who replaced that bad valve. A new valve requires that the seat be reground and I would have had a complete valve job done myself including sealsI am learning as I go so I really appreciate the input, with that said, no I did not lap them I just put 2 new ones in because I was naive. I cleaned the valves and seats but nothing more. I replaced the valve guide oil seals but still have these issues. So the valves need to be lapped but could it also be a ring issue? My plan (please critique) is to pull the head, do the liquid leak test, lap the valves, leak test again, put in new oil seals, put new rings on all 4 pistons, re-hone all 4 cylinders and replace piston #3 to be safe. Once I’m in there I will see if the crank and rod bearings need replaced and take bore measurements.I would concentrate on the head and valves.  The fact that your dry compression was the same as the wet compression on #3 probably means it’s a valve, not a rings, problem.  No way you can afford a professional valve job?
You need a pro to look at this head to see if it’s worth fixing, and to determine what needs to be done.It’s not just a matter of lapping the valves in. Lapping is finish work AFTER the valve seats are ground and the seat valve face contact area is checked.
In a case like this what should have been done is to just have a valve job done at the local auto machine shop. Around here they charge 5 bucks a hole; meaning 5 for each properly ground and fitted seat and valve. In your 4 valve head that would mean 80 dollars plus valve stem seals. That’s cheap.
I think that if you bring that cylinder up; to TDC on the compression stroke and apply some compressed air to it you will hear it hissing out the exhaust, intake, or both.
Another quite often overlooked thing is checking the head surface to make sure it’s flat. I don’t know what the spec is on your Focus but generally speaking .002  to .,003 thousandths of an inch is the point at which the head needs to be surfaced. And that ain’t much wiggle room at all.,I will be taking it to a machine shop to have it worked on but for $300. One shop wanted to do everything they can think of on it for $600.",,,,

Half of what Click and Clack said would have been flagged on this forum.What I would like to see is a format change to ‘Ask Someone’.  A form that the poster fills out that prevents posting until all pertinent data is filled in.I listened to the show for years and while I remember the guys dishing out some good-natured ribbing, I don’t remember them being outright mean. I don’t remember them telling anyone they didn’t deserve an answer. I don’t remember them waiting until someone hung up and then saying, “Boy, that guy was really dumb!” But then, perhaps my memory has faded?My favorite response to a caller was when a guy bought a new car and put a large bra on the front to protect the paint. It took him almost an hour to put it on. Then someone told him he should only use it around town because at high speeds it could flutter and damage the paint.
His dilemma was that once a week, he took an hour long trip to another town and he did not want to re-install it weekly
but it would take too long using back roads for the trip where he could go slowly, so could the brothers give him some advice.
One of the brothers told him to go to K Mart and get a parking space between two big 2 door American cars.  He asked if he could get what he needed at K Mart and he was assured he could. He was instructed to spend plenty of time in K Mart, browse the whole store and maybe eat lunch there.
He asked what he should buy. They told him it didn’t matter, as long as he spent a couple of hours there because when he came out he would have door dings on both sides of his car and could get on with his life.Not that I know anything about BMW but I simply could not figure out what was being said.  If the car was locked or if the ignition was locked or both or neither.  I just kept thinking of the guy that died when his friends locked him in and he couldn’t get out from the inside.
@oldtimer_11 reminded me.  I’m not going to tell the story but we used to have a local ask the builder radio show on Saturday.  A guy called in once asking about a creaking noise in the winter.  Anyone who ever spent a little time in the north when the temps get close to or below zero, know this is normal as the wood contracts and bang every once in a while.  At any rate they gave the guy such a hard time and convinced him the house was going to collapse and he should get out immediately.

That’s just hilarious My 2009 Pilot that I bought new and had the oil changed every 5,000 miles and had everything serviced the motor bit the dust at 128,000 miles. This engine shuts off cylinders and will run on 2 or 3 cylinders and it’s an early version. This isn’t uncommon for this motor.You may have found out why the previous owner was selling it.
Either way… Honda isn’t going to warranty or recall a 10 year old vehicle with high miles on the engine.
Sorry, and good luck.You bought a used car from a private party who quite likely knew there was a problem with it. You are on your own as to that issue. Period.
You also have not said how long ago you bought it and whether or not you have even checked the motor oil level.
As for a lawsuit blaming Honda for this and demanding a Recall you are seriously misguided. That is not gonna ever happen nor should it. I hate to be crass here but it’s no worse than what you are wanting from Honda because your decision to buy a high miles, 10 year old car went south.",,,,

248,Fiat grande punto 1.9 starting problem,Maintenance/Repairs,4,169,"Hello,
I own a fiat grande punto 1.9 multijet, 2006. Im writing here because i dont know what else to do about my problem. The car wont start when the engine isnt completely cold. In a -5°C weather and with cold engine it starts completely normal but then it neads at least 4h cool down time until it will start normally again. So even if the engine is a little bit warm it wont start. I changed the fuel pump, checked fuel flow, changed temperature sensor (because when it doesnt start it shows an error in which states that the cooling fluid temperature is too high), checked the battery (which is also new), checked the car with different diagnostics and everything seems to be fine jet it doesnt start when warm (if its very warm it starts normally, it doesnt start just when its half warm). When the car doesnt start, I pop the hood up, disconnect the temperature sensor and the car starts fine (u can hear the fuel pump pumping for longer when i disconnect the temp. sensor). I dont know what else to check so if anyone had the same problem i would appreciate the help.
Thank you in advance.Two possibilities I come up with is your new temp sensor is bad or more likely the wiring or connector is bad between sensor and ECM.The wiring was checked and its good, temp sensor was checked for the current flow before installing and also showed results in borders of the specsI’m still stuck on temp sensing. Can you hook a scanner to it and monitor whether the ECU reports the proper temperatures during warm up. Another thought is that, is there a chance that there is air in the cooling system reporting false temp readings.I will try and keep you posted",,,,

need to fluid put in transmisson


Was this vague post to be ( I need to know what kind of fluid to put in my vehicles transmission ? ).
If that is correct it should be in your owners manual or any parts store can sell you the proper fluid.The 3.0 v6 has an aisin built trans. It has yellow dipstick behind front motor mount.  Not hard to reach. It has a hold down bolt. The 4cyl motor has a cvt trans. Poor reliability but if yours is still moving at 18+ yrs old then you are lucky. I don’t know how to add fluid to the cvt.
Maybe you have a manual trans? That’s another procedure.
I assume you have a leak if you “need” to add fluid?My 2005 Saturn V-6 VUE is going strong with 140,000 miles on her. Never had a problem except the OEM clock loses a few minutes every month. Have always had it serviced on the recommended schedule. My Dad taught me well. He passed away long ago but I still hear him reminding me of specific regular maintenance needs in the back of my mind. (I am sure others experience something similar if they had a parent who was a mechanic - a jet engine AND auto mechanic in my case.)They only used the 03 v6 trans for 2 yrs, 02-03. In 04 they changed the trans supplier. The vue was a world car. Sourced parts from different places.You need to add fluid? So, add fluid. Why are you telling us instead of getting it done?The CVT has a complicated fill procedure, scan tool required.

Do those that hold all this knowledge keep their cars longer than people without this knowledge?
When the average Joe has their transmission or engine fail, they just go get another car instead of sinking in a couple thousand dollars into a car that is worth less. But do the very knowledgeable people just spend a few hundred on parts and make the repair themselves? If you have the knowledge and expertise, is there ever a time maintenance and repairs does not make financial sense if you don’t have to pay for the labor of a mechanic, if you just make the repair yourself and just pay for parts? Besides when you get into into a collision.
I don’t have this knowledge, but I’m wondering if those that do can keep their car a lot longer.


 YoshiMoshi3:

That’s really hard to answer because we don’t have access to those figures.



 YoshiMoshi3:

When the average Joe has their transmission or engine fail


Actually they generally can’t just buy another car. Often they still owe money on the car so they have the car fixed. It is cheaper to sink $2500 - $5000 into a car for a new transmission or engine than to buy a new car. When I was younger, I’d just buy a rebuilt trans for $1200 and install it myself. Or I’d rebuild the engine. The result is the same, the car soldiers on but my cost is far lower.
Once the car gets to the “nickle and dime” stage where it is $300 here and $500 there for repairs, I can do that for #125 here and $250 there.



 YoshiMoshi3:

is there ever a time maintenance and repairs does not make financial sense if you don’t have to pay for the labor of a mechanic


Sure. That price point is just just different. Rust never sleeps so at some point, rust may become the biggest factor. Even if you can do structural repairs - weld patches and such - it becomes a waste of time. For sunny climates, roached paint, crispy rubber bits, cracked dash, split seats, droopy headliners all add up to a trip to the scrap-yard or a budget sale.


 YoshiMoshi3:

Do those that hold all this knowledge keep their cars longer than people without this knowledge?


2 answers – 1.  Yes  2.  NoI do any and everything when it comes to my cars so I tend to keep them forever. My current Lincoln has going on 300k miles and with no obvious critical issues  I will likely keep it the rest of my life. I feel the same way about old blue jeans and the house I live in. Forever items…
The only car that I’ve really wanted to be rid of was my old 1987 Mercury Sable wagon; the most uncool car on the planet.  At 410k miles it was just flat mind numbing boring. A nasty storm sent a tree branch through the windshield one night so that was all the excuse I needed to be rid of it.


 ok4450:

The only car that I’ve really wanted to be rid of was my old 1987 Mercury Sable wagon; the most uncool car on the planet.


I used to work with a woman whose husband was an engineer, and who was able to buy used cars, repair them himself, and keep driving them for many years.  One day, when he was leaving the house in his quest for a “new” used car, he asked his wife if there was any particular make or model that she would prefer, because they would likely have that car for a long time.  Her response was, “Anything is okay–as long as you don’t come home with a Taurus or Sable wagon, because I can’t stand the look of those things”.
A couple of hours later, he arrived home with… you  guessed it…
A Taurus wagon.
There was reportedly a bit of tension in the house for a few days…
Car guys probably take more time evaluating their new vehicles and that should lead to keeping them longer. There are times when that doesn’t work out. @Mountainbike bought a new car and it was very uncomfortable because of a bad back. He sold it once he found out about the pain issue and replaced it with a car that he found very comfortable and he kept it until he stopped posting here. He’s probably still driving it if he’s still around.Mechanics purchase the cheapest vehicles they can find, or find a free one if possible, and keep them running as long as possible.
That’s because mechanics know that vehicles are required pieces of property that are money holes, and try to keep the costs of owning one to a minimum.
TesterNo offence to mechanics, but in the 70’s I was advised to be wary of cars owned by mechanics.Might be because some don’t get rid of them until they are too close to tough.


 Barkydog:

I’ve heard that a lot, and a lot more recently than you did
I suspect it’s because mechanics are wrenching on customer’s cars and trucks 4 - 5 days a week, therefore they don’t particularly feel like wrenching on their own cars on the weekend
Kind of like that other saying . . . a cobbler’s own shoes are in terrible shapeAs a follow-on, my daughter had a childhood friend who’s father fixed up and customized cars for extra money. I saw one in his garage when I picked her up one day. It was a black 50s Ford sedan with flames; a beautiful car. What did he drive?  It was a salvage title Cavalier that he repaired enough to get it registered. The car crabbed down the street, but it worked for him.I think there is no single answer for that.  The category is just too broad.  I’m sure some here will tear into engines and even transmissions, but I drought most would.  At any rate engine and transmissions are pretty reliable for several hundred thousands of miles if maintained.  It’s all the maintenance and other parts that I think mechanical people tend to tackle.  OTOH the older you get the less you like to get your hands dirty.Some folks like my family who rely entirely on professionals for car maintenance and repairs keep cars long miles and years.  We’ve kept cars 16, 17, 18, 20, 24 years.  The outlier was kept only 7 years.
I think it is mostly a matter of mindset, attention to good maintenance, preference, and resources that determines how long in time and mileage anyone typically keeps a car.

Do those that hold all this knowledge keep their cars longer than people without this knowledge?


Well yes and no. Personally speaking (as a professional mechanic) I tend to keep my daily drivers for 2-3 years. That has as much to do with my short attention span as anything else. Much like most people don’t want to eat the same meal for dinner 7 nights a week, I don’t want to drive the same car all the time. So I tend to buy cars that are in cosmetically great condition but in need of mechanical repair. I fix them, drive them, then send them down the road when I tire of them. In 2014 I bought a 2002 Explorer that had a noisy differential, no A/C, and electrical issues that made the windows not work and the battery die overnight. I paid $2400 for the car, fixed it for $300 in parts, drove it for 50,000 miles, and sold it in 2017 for $2200. Two years ago I bought a 2006 Trailblazer for $3400. It had a grinding noise from the engine, the fuel gauge didn’t work, the A/C was stuck on full hot, and the check engine light was on. Fixed it for $250 in parts and have put 35,000 miles on it, though I did buy new tires last year.
On the other hand, my wife tends to keep cars a long time. She was driving a 15 year old car in 2017. She loved it and asked how long I could keep it running. I told her forever. Finally after enough nagging from me she bought a 2018 car. It’s one thing for me to drive old fixer uppers but I can’t have my wife driving a 15 year old car.
She loved her old car and she loves the new one. I can already see that 10 years from now I’ll be nagging her to buy a new one.

I suspect it’s because mechanics are wrenching on customer’s cars and trucks 4 - 5 days a week, therefore they don’t particularly feel like wrenching on their own cars on the weekend
Kind of like that other saying . . . a cobbler’s own shoes are in terrible shape


I think there’s another side to that that is just as true, that a professional in any trade will have enough pride and confidence to show others that he is the best at what he does. I have a friend who is a cabinet maker. His house has the finest kitchen and bathroom you’ll ever see. My friend who is a tailor is always well dressed.
I’m in charge of hiring at the shop where I work, and obviously was when I had my own place. If a mechanic comes in for an interview in a rusty beater that’s chugging and smoking and leaks oil, I probably won’t hire him. If he takes such poor care of his own cars how can I trust him to take care of customers’ cars?

251,Dealership screwed license plate into rubber plate suports,General Discussion,11,416,"I bought a new 2020 Ford Fusion Hybrid today and just realized that the saleswoman screwed  two rear license plate screws into the rubber  supports/bumpers at the bottom where the plate sits instead of into the two holes for the top of the plate. The screws wont back out of the rubber now and there are also flakes of what looks like paint/plastic around where she screwed them in with a power screwdriver. And some small scratches to the paint as well. I’m wondering if there was any damage done to the trunk beyond the destroyed rubber supports for the plate. Has anyone else had this happen? Brand new car and she power screws the plate in the wrong place.I am not sure I understand your issue, so traded in my 03, salesman could not get the screws loose, rips it off, stomps on it to make the plate straight, and put it on the new car. Looks ok, we all have our stories, Pictures possible?Go back to the dealership, go the the offices inside and start complaining.Screenshot_20201127-194834_Gallery1080×1920 105 KB
This picture is from the dealer site which still has the car up on their site. Those two small rubber nubs at the bottom of where the plate goes are supposed to go through the bottom plate holes and act as support. She screwed the two plate screws right into and through those rubber nubs instead of the two hole guides at the top where they are supposed to go. I’m wondering what additional damage was done.They are closed. I sent a message and plan to go back tomorrow. I’m sure they won’t think it is a big deal. But it is to me. She drilled screws where they were not supposed to go, causing damage.""wentwest,
Go back to the dealership, go the the offices inside and start complaining.
Agree and in this case loudly( I don’t usually recomend this ) but it seems in order this time.                                                                                                                                          A pet peeve of mine people who have to use a pair of plier’s with two hand’s should not have access to tool’s especialy power tool’s.Well yeah she did it wrong.  Now my take.  To save about 75 cents some companies use just the two upper screws.  I’ve seen many cars where the plate just flaps in the breeze.  It should have four both top and bottom.  So while you are at it, have them install two more sockets instead of the bumpers to secure the plate.


 DJO:

Has anyone else had this happen? Brand new car and she power screws the plate in the wrong place.


The chance that this has happened to someone else ?  What does it matter , it happened to you so you talk to the dealer about it  . And if it did the chance that  person or persons seeing your post is really low.They should fix it at their expense. Make sure you get a receipt for the visit no matter what the outcome is to document the visit. The reason for visit should clearly state your complaint.
It seems that the screws went completely through the rubber bumpers and damaged the paint. If the metal is exposed, it will rust. You want that repaired at their expense even if it involves repainting the entire trunk. Small damage sometimes grows in size because there is not a full break in the painted area. I had damage repaired at the back of my rear fender, and the repainted area went all the way up the rear pillar and along the roof line to the gasket between that panel and the windshield.I also thought the front plate looked a little off so I checked and it is about an inch off center and not level. It is the dealer installed plate bracket/frame that the plate screws into on the front bumper of the car. And apparently this model (2020 Fusion Hybrid SE) only comes with two front floor mats? Even the Focus I had came with a full set of 4 floor mats. I think every car I’ve ever had came with all 4 mats.If only two screws were used and they went through the upper holes on the plate to the lower holes on the bumper, then it is wrong, but now damage was done.  The license plate can be reinstalled correctly but for screws should be used.
As long as the screws in the bumper only go through the designated spots, all is OK.  If they drove a screw anywhere else, you would be justified in demanding that they repair/replace the bumper cover.  There are little dimples in the bumper cover to indicate where the screws go and since the screws go through the bumper, it can cause a little paint to flake.  It should not be visible with the plate mounted.She screwed the plate into those rubber nubs…so what, is your plate hanging off your back bumper? I’m just having trouble visualizing this, since right below those numbs the bumper cover usually juts out several inches. If it’s what I’m thinking, it should look comically wrong.
As for floor mats, go check another car on the lot; I’ve never heard of that either.",,,,
252,Clear Coat peeling on bonnet,Maintenance/Repairs,44,724,"Hello i am wanting to buy a car for my son i have found a car, its a 2006 Holden Astra. I have seen pictures and one of the picture’s the man is showing a small area bit bigger than a hand Clear Coat peeling. I was wondering how much would it cost to fix this small area? I know from experience once a car has started to peel if not fixed it spreads and becomes a bigger problem. Can anyone help me with my question. It will be my sons first car, and he is on his L""s. Thank you. I dont want the whole bonnet to be re sprayed and fixed just that small area on the bonnet.Saw maybe a 2015 ram with a trashed out clearcoat on the hood, size of a 16"" pizza. Not from your neck of the woods, what is “he is on his L""s”? You could do it yourself if you don’t mind it looks fine from a galloping horse. My guess $600. Make sure to get the car inspected by a good mechanic prior to purchase.image959×720 67.2 KB I dont understand why the picture isn’t coming up? I couldn’t do the job myself i am a butcher not a car person lol. Yes i have already looked into having a mechanic to come to the site where the car is. Thank you for replying to me, much appreciated.Oh there is the picture lol.Take the vehicle to some resprayers/panel beaters for estimates for a respray.
TesterHello but i dont want to by my sons first car if i have to start fixing it.Then, why are you asking this question?
TesterTo see if someone would know if it is worth buying. And if i bought it someone might know how to do ( Fix ) that small clear peeling on the bonnet, for a fraction of the price if i was to take it to a Panel beater.Most of the people on this board have never driven a Holden, know their history, or know their value in pounds.
What’s the going price for the same year, mileage Holden’s in the local Craigslist car ads?

And also i dont know for sure but sometimes there might be a person that does these things ( Fixing the peeling at home, and might do it cheaper as its hard these.Craigslist in the USA has warnings about dealing with sellers I imagine your local board may have them too. Be sure to read and understand the warnings. There’s a lot that can go wrong in that situation.Oh no i live in Adelaide South Australia. Thank you for you reply.Peeling clearcoat is not a reason to automatically reject the car, especially one that is 14 years old. It’s all about overall condition and how the car has been maintained.
A passable repair can be made with some sanding and a can of clearcoat spray.


 NYBo:

Peeling clearcoat is not a reason to automatically reject the car


I’m with @NYBo on this.  I have an '87 pickup (so my opinion may not matter), but it lived outside in the desert for many years, lost its clearcoat a long time ago.  I have to pay attention to the places that get damaged to prevent rust, and it looks worn, but the body will last another 33 years structurally with that little care.  I’m not getting dates (even if I had a nice car I wouldn’t) which makes it advice a young man may not like but a mother may.
A Ripley’s Believe it or not some years ago had the story of a guy who ate a car (eating odd things was his gimmick).  He ate a Holden, not because he was Australian but because he decided that was the best car to eat.


 Melinda-10:

Hello but i dont want to by my sons first car if i have to start fixing it.


You are looking at a 14 year old vehicle . It might not need anything right now but you can be assured that it will need things just like all used vehicles do.  I would not worry about the clear coat for this reason .
As our insurance agent says about teenage drivers , it is not if they have an accident it is when will they have that accident .If you want the car to look as new the entire panel will need to be painted, then next year the roof and trunk. Patching one spot is hopeless, the clear coat has deteriorated from exposure to the sun, the other top surfaces are soon to follow.
I bought my son a car with peeling paint, after a year he asked me about having it painted. I told him rather than spend $1,000 on getting a cheap repaint, he should sell the car and buy a better one. He didn’t hesitate, sold the car right away, I guess he didn’t like that car. Will your son reject a free car if the paint is flawed?
Of coarse Holden vehicles are from down under, not the UK. Some Holden cars made it to the states. My co-worker has a Holden Commodore with a V-8, it was sold in the states as a Pontiac G8.",,,,
253,Honda Element V-Tech Solenoid P2647,Maintenance/Repairs,8,209,"My gasket on the solenoid was leaking. Took it to a local mechanic and he replaced the unit with a new gasket.  About a mile from home it would not accelerate and started bucking. When I slowed down and kept the RPMs under 3000 it ran fine. Check engine light cam on also. Took it back to the mechanic and he plugged it into the code reading machine. The P2647 (V-Tech Solenoid) came up. That was the part he replaced.  He put several more on and it did not help. Same problem same code. I was going to take it the Honda dealer and then the light went out and it ran fine for 8 months. Now it’s coming on and off with the same code. Seems to be running great and has no problem accelerating.  On the Honda Element Owners Club Forum I see lots have had the same problem. Anyone here have a solution? Thanks.Are you using the exact type/grade/viscosity of motor oil that Honda specifies?
Have you been changing the oil at least as often as Honda specifies, including elapsed time, as well as odometer mileage?
I asked those questions because a lot of the problems that people experience with variable valve timing is the result of the wrong motor oil and/or engine sludging that has built-up as a result of extended oil change intervals.Yes I am. I change it every 4000 miles and use the 5-20 synthetic just like it says.  I bought this used and it had 85,000 miles on it. Now it has 150,000. I’ve always changed it more often and called for.  Others in the Element Forum have mentioned this also. I know where you’re coming from. Screens get clogged. Mine are fine. I’ve checked. Thanks for the reply.I’ve also done this.
Tech Notes What does this mean? The most common problem that can set the P2652 code is the engine oil. Before replacing any parts change the engine oil with the factory recommend oil weight. There is a Factory Service Bulletin for the following Honda Models 2003-2012 Honda Accord L4 2002-2005 Honda Civic Si 2002-2009 Honda CR-V 2011 Honda CR-Z 2003-2011 Honda Element 2007-2011 Honda Fit The factory bulletin suggests that replacing the VTEC oil pressure switch (P/N 37250-PNE-G01, H/C 6737217) take care of the problem.

254,What gas grade is required for 2018 Lexus IS 300 AWD F Sport?,Maintenance/Repairs,16,294,"Hello experts and knowledgeable drivers.     I recently came off the phone with both Toyota and Lexus dealership on what gas grade is required for a 2018 Lexus IS 300 AWD F sport, and both companies gave me uncomfortable answers.
Toyota said at first regular was to be used, then they changed their mind when I told them my research showed Premium is required via google.
Lexus said regular is to be used but went on to say the choice was up to me.
Google keeps showing me Premium 91 to 93 and labled "" required""
My owner’s manual is so thick I get sick from reading through those awful lot of pages.
However, I have received great help here on CarTalk in the past and this is why I am choosing to seek your help.
Thank you very much.The best advice is to read the manual. There may also be a sticker on the gas door indicating the required fuel.It is confusing, the owners manual states “Unleaded gasoline only”. When premium is required the manual usually states “Premium unleaded gasoline”.
However page 587 shows 91 octane or higher, that is premium gasoline.
Thank you for your reply.
On the gas tank lid, it reads E20/E85 ( I am not too sure)  but what does these numbers mean?EDIT: Given the picture of the gas cap provided by @Nevada_545, you do NOT have a flex-fuel vehicle.


 Clueless33:

E20/E85 ( I am not too sure) but what does these numbers mean?


The E refers to ethanol in the gasoline. The second number refers to the percentage of ethanol IN the gasoline. Normal pump gas is E10 or 10% ethanol. E85 is 85% ethanol fuel, E20 is 20% ethanol fuel. You CAN use that, if you wish, but don’t HAVE to use it and it MUST have an octane rating of 91 for you to use it.I am not too sure about these numbers.  I am away from the car as of right now.  But I recalled seeing those numbers vaguely.Thank you.  Very helpful.


 Clueless33:

On the gas tank lid, it reads E20/E85 ( I am not too sure) but what does these numbers mean?


With the line through E20/E85 it means do not use E20, E85 or anything in between. You do not have a flex fuel vehicle. You can use E10 or E15.
20201130_1152332576×1932 708 KBOne more factor-you have a high-output turbocharged 4 cylinder, which is another reason to use premium.fueleconomy.gov is another source for fuel requirements.

Note that the IS 300 AWD has a V 6, no turbocharger.Thank you, but what does this all mean?  I am still not understanding.
Does this mean E10 or E15 is premium gas or regular?   I normally go to shell gas station and I only see 87/89/93E designates the percentage of ethanol blended in to the gasoline. E10 would be 10% ethanol. E15 is 15% ethanol.
Octane is something different. You need to be putting the 93 octane in there, and it needs to have a maximum E rating of 15. Generally if gas has more than 10 or 15 percent ethanol in it, it will be clearly marked as such - either with E20/E85 or “Flex fuel only.”


 Clueless33:

My owner’s manual is so thick I get sick from reading through those awful lot of pages.


You presumably spent a lot of money on this car. Do you really want to put that at risk by not reading the manual to learn how to maintain your car correctly?E10 is available as both ‘regular’ and ‘premium ’,  as shadow fox said use the 93 octane.  Some states 91 will be the highest available.Most gasoline sold contains 10% ethanol, both regular and premium, there is a message on the gas pump indicating the alcohol content.
Some time in the future you may see E20 at a gas station, you should not use this in your car.
Octane rating is a different subject, you should be using 91 octane or higher in your vehicle.


 Clueless33:

Does this mean E10 or E15 is premium gas or regular?


Either. E10 or E15 is just the Ethanol content. Gas stations around where I live only have E10. So all grades (87, 89 and 91) octane are E10. You vehicle requires a minimum of 91 octane. So 91 or higher octane is what to use. Using a lower octane under hard acceleration could do serious damage to your vehicle.",,,,
255,1999 Buick LeSabre - Hard starting,Maintenance/Repairs,9,322,"Hard to start in morning. Fine rest of day. Fine even when I shut it off after 30 seconds after it finally starts for 1st time.
Has brand new battery. All fuses ok except one for trunk makes testing device flash, but no change when removing that fuse, except then auto door locks don’t work. Friend thinks maybe battery is getting drained overnight with a ‘parasitic draw’ on the battery. ?You need to give us a very complete description of what “hard to start” means. A number of problems might be described that way.Hard to start meaning it turns over but won’t start, I shut it off and try again, and on 3rd try (on the cars worst day) it starts. The multi meter is what I think the device is called that my mechanic friend connected to the battery when we tested to see which fuse might be connected to the slow overnight drain of the battery. As I said, the fuse for the trunk caused the meter to flash. My friend said he hadn’t seen that kind of reaction on the meter, and that usually if a fuse pointed to a problem that the light on the multi meter simply would go out. The electronic trunk options were disconnected (at a plug in device located behind the lock on the trunk’s lid) so that it can only be opened with a key. Otherwise, there is a switch to open trunk next to the steering wheel, a button in glove box, and a 3rd remote option on key chain.
Replies appreciated!Your problem is very different from “hard to start”, because that just sounds like a low battery due to other causes.

Get the battery fully charged, and confirm that it is good.
See if the battery continues to  discharge, now that you have disconnected the electric mechanism. Note that the problem still might be in that circuit, because it could be a frayed wire in that circuit. It would be best to find what fuse controls that circuit, and remove the fuse.
I confirmed that my brand new battery is indeed good, and that the alternator is working. Removed that questionable fuse and the problem persisted the following morning.So, you have ruled out that circuit, and you need to keep looking. I am not sure what meter you are using, and what the flash means. It might have detected a problem in the fuse box near that particular fuse.


 Jeffelartista:

it turns over but won’t start, I shut it off and try again, and on 3rd try (on the cars worst day) it starts.


A long crank time usually is caused by the fuel system not holding pressure while the engine is off. Connect a fuel pressure gauge and monitor the fuel pressure after shutting off the engine.Thank you for your reply!Fuel and fuel pressure may be leaking back into the gas tank. To test this, try the key dance: turn the key to Run (not all the way to Start) and the fuel pump should run for a couple seconds. You may hear it. Turn Off, then back to Run so it runs some more. After a few such steps, then turn the key all the way to Start. Good luck!Thank you for your reply!",,,,

How hard is it for you to go to a site like Tire Rack and see if you like something ?  Just because someone likes a tires look does not mean you will .I did end up going to Tire Rack and several other sites and wasn’t able to find any tires that suited my needs. They were mostly all off road oriented tires, whereas I wanted something that would look good on a lowered truck. That’s why I was asking for advice, because I thought more experienced people had had this same sort of “issue” and found tires that worked.You picked a fairly obsolete wheel size if you want road-tires rather than truck tires. A 255/50/16 will fit but is fairly short and may look small in your wheel openings. There are a few tires in that size.

257,Engine oil won’t drian,Maintenance/Repairs,37,25.8k,"The oil is warm, car is level, plug out, loosened filler cap, engine oil still won’t drain?  Anyone know why?
How long has it been since the oil was changed?  Is it possible that it has formed a gel that is resistant to flowing?Sludge build-up plugging the drain? Try putting a screwdriver into the hole to unblock. Don’t worry, you shouldn’t hit anything critical. Just don’t hammer it in.What kind of car (year, make, and model)?  Is the drain plug on the bottom of the pan or on the side near the bottom?  What does the oil look like on the dip stick?  Does it look relatively clean or like sludge?
You could try removing the oil filter if you haven’t already.  That will create another path for air to come in.  If the drain hole is on the back side of the pan, you could also try jacking up the front end.Did you have oil in the engine to begin with?And,yes, check the filter for a feel of the amount and condition of your oil.
There is no oil in the engine…
You removed something other than the drain plug…
The oil has been in so long it has congealed into sludge…

Solutions: Check your dipstick. Is there any oil on it? If so, see reason #2…There is at least one model of luxury car well known for needing computer directions to let oil drain. PLEASE do the obvious thing and let us know the make and model.You said you LOOSENED the oil filler cap. Try REMOVING it.Don’t you love it when someone asks a vague question like this and then never responds?It’s a 2003 VW Jetta TDI (diesel.)  It has been about 7,000 miles since last change.
The plug I pulled is in the front of the car, towards the driver’s side.  If it wasn’t the oil drain, what did I drain?  Less than a quart came out.  It’s not red.  It is oil.  It is not as black as the oil on the dipstick.Yes, the dipstick reads full.
I stuck a stiff wire up the plug, and nothing I can see is blocking flow.
I removed the filter also.
The oil is not sludge.My best guess since I can’t see the car from here is that you may have removed the differential drain plug.  If that is the case DO NOT drive the car until you can verify exactly what the situation is.
But, since “less than a qt.” sounds like a very small amount for a differential, this issue needs to be checked into thoroughly.  Whatever you did drain, it is apparently not the motor oil if the dipstick is reading “full”.
That being said, you are not doing your car any favors if you go 7k between oil changes.   I would suggest that, in the future, you have a professional change your oil every…5k at most.
(Note:  “Professional” does NOT include Jiffy Lube or any of its clones.)So the drain plug is out and a quart came out and the dip stick still shows oil in the car?  Wow.
By the way, usually the oil looks cleaner on the dip stick than when it is drained.  The fact that yours appears in the opposite fashion has me concerned.
If this car has a manual transmission, I am pretty sure you drained the transmission oil.It probably sounds strange, but, when I was younger, and knew that I didn’t know what I needed to know, and had no one to ask, I got me a repair manual. The mother of necessity is definitely a prodder of the intellect. In other words, if’n you don’t know, sometimes, you has to pay for it.In the original post, Prindle tells us NOTHING came out of his oil pan. Then he tells he drained a gearbox by mistake, he is not sure which one, but he is poking around in the gearbox with a coat hanger hoping to accomplish something…It might be time to bail out. If you drained something but can’t identify it, call the tow truck to haul your car to the nearest good mechanic.  At $70 towing costs less than a $2000 transmission replacement.Check all the other fluid levels and you may have an idea what you drained. I’m guessing the steering rack has been drained or the power steering reservoir. You can’t check the rack if you don’t have power steering. If power steering, I would still have questions unless the reservoir is dry. Then you can refill it. If not, it needs a tow job to the shop.If it was not so cold out, I might take the belly pan off my car and figure out what you might have drained.  I have a 2002 NB TDI and I suspect they are much the same.  I, like the others, suspect you drained something other than the engine oil.
If you want to continue DIY I would suggest first getting some sort of manual.  You also might want to stop by Freds at www.tdiclub.com 7  That is the center for all the action on TDIs.  Someone is sure to have a photo to post for you so you can tell exactly what you did and what you need to do to correct it.  They likely even have a member or two close to you who would be willing to stop by and give you a hand.  If you are in Central Ohio, I am willing to stop by.Just my two cents . . . but let’s see if it’s engine oil that you drained out.  Put the oil filter back on . . . leave the drain plug out . . . pour a fresh quart of engine oil into the crankcase . . . watch to see if it is coming out.  Even a little bit more coming out of whatever drain plug you removed . . . say half a quart . . . would confirm that you’ve removed the engine oil plug and you have a blockage.  But my guess is that you’ll see nothing coming out . . . and that you drained something else . . . transmission maybe.  Since we can’t see it from here . . .  that’s my best guess.

I disconnected the battery and the truck stays on. I believe this may eliminate the alternator, but not sure. The last time it cranked on, I turned it off. I let it sit for a few minutes, I go to crank it back on and only a clicking noise. The battery shows 88% and that is from an overnight charge from 100%. Is that a possible cause for the truck to stall out? I’m not sure about the Amps, but I believe it to be about 600 Amps which may or may not be enough to crank the truck on. The truck will stall and after a certain amount of time crank back up. It sounds great while it’s running. No oders, no white smoke from the tail pipe, nothing leaking. I am trying to figure out a way to test the spark plugs but I’m still researching that. I’m no mechanic and blind as a bat with this now, any help would be great. What to do bext? I am wanting to fix this myself as I am on a tight budget. I have no special tools just some good ole wrenches and muscle. I gratefuly accept any tips, tricks, suggestions or any feedback at all.First, with engine cold, remove radiator cap. Then start the engine and look for bubbles in the coolant. Then do a wet\dry compression test. If both of these tests pass, you can then move on to the separate electrical issue.Hey tcmichnorth: Thank you. I have removed the cap. I did crank it up, It’s hard to tell if it warmed up to normal temp, but it did start bubling and even overflowing the radiator. I’ll have to look into a wet/dry compression test, I never have done that. I believe along with that I need to check the spark plugs/wires. When it’s running, it sounds great, no leaks, no smoke smooth idle, then it stalls and all I get a click and right now, I’m not even getting that. I will work that wet/dry compression test and keep you up to date. Thanks for the help.  Cheers.Bubbles in the coolant?  That’s not good and would indicate a possible head gasket failure.  Do the chemical test for that before spending any more time or money.  That wouldn’t cause stalling though but a poor battery could.Hey Bing: I did not describe that correctly. sorry. The water was more than just warm, it was moving and overflowing over the radiator, No bubbles. Again, my mistake. The idea of a poor battery causing a stall is actually and hopeful thought. I have no problem with replacing the battery and I am going to do that as soon as I am able to get to a parts store. Having no transport and living where I do, well, it about a 2 hour walk to the nearest store and that really slows progress down. LOL! So, right now it looks like the next, is the chemical test and  replace the battery. Thanks for any help.You can’t perform a compression test with a dead battery, sounds like you need a new battery and not a compression test. Monitor the battery voltage with the engine off, while cranking the engine and while running.
When operating the engine with the radiator cap off the coolant will expand and spill over, that is normal, you don’t need a chemical test.Just how old is that battery?
If it’s more than 5yrs old, it might be wiser to just replace it and be done with it
It might be unable to hold a charge . . . or you might have a parasitic drain
Google “parasitic drain test” . . . I’m sure there are plenty of guys that have posted the procedure.  This is something you can perform quickly and cheaply. 50 milliamps is the limit, by the way
what do you mean when you say the radiator hose slips off . . . ?
Can I presume you have a plastic/aluminum radiator?
If so, are you sure, the plastic neck isn’t damaged, and that’s why the radiator hose is slipping off?Nevada_545 Thanks.Hey db4690: The battery is at least 5 years old. So, yes I am replacing it. I believe the first time I installed the hose, I did not place the clamp on correctly, or I did not tighten it enough; and after driving a few miles it simply slipped off. The radiator is aluminum, with a plastic top and plastic connecting ports. Other than improper install, I have no idea of what could have caused the bottom hose to disconnect on it’s own. When I installed it again this time. I muscled and checked to make sure the hose could go no further against the connection port and I tightened the clamp till I could no longer turn the screw. I am hoping that is a fix as I have not yet been able to test drive. I’ll google the “parasitic drain test.” Thanks for the response.OK, bubbling versus bubbles?  Over-flowing no bubbles?  I stand corrected.  No need to check for combustion in the coolant at this point.Hey Bing: Yeah, sometimes I’m not good at describing details, but it is correct that over-flowing with no bubbles. I’m glad it does not need a combustion check, but I have made a note of that for future reference. I appreciate all responses. So, thanks.The reason we were looking for bubbles in the radiator was to see if compressed air from a cylinder was being pushed into the cooling system through the head gasket. If the head gasket was leaking you would have seen air bubbles very shortly after starting it. The reason we went down this road was blowing hoses are a symptom of blown head gasket. The compression test would be to confirm or deny the results. These are two quick and easy tests to eliminate the possibility of a bad head or gasket. Seeing as it passed the bubbles test, @Nevada_545 is right. You need to bypass the compression test and get a new battery. I would be sure to clean battery cables at battery and where the battery grounds and starter and alternator connectors. That may resolve your problems but some good insurance would be to do a parasitic draw test as @db4690 suggested.Do you hav an Autozone in your area? My understanding is that they will now make home deliveries. Even batteries.Tricks? We got tricks. This won’t help but open the hood at night and look for sparks jumping off the plug wires. A 63 Ford would put on a really good show. If you see a light show, change the wires.


 Scott-262:

I disconnected the battery and the truck stays on.


Don’t do that again! Never disconnect the battery while a vehicle is running. I know there isn’t much in the way of electronics on an 89 Ram, but in a new vehicle, there’s a good chance you’d fry something expensive.",,,,
259,Modifications to 2007 Chevy Trailblazer,General Discussion,16,681,"Hey all. Wanting to get more HP or better performance out of the 4.2L I6 in this 2007 Chevy Trailblazer. Any ideas that might be worth pursuing? I saw where people have mention the pcm4less, or something like that, but I’m not sure how exactly it works or what it can do. Even if I could go the other way, towards better gas milage, that would be fine as well. Kinda wondering about the range of modifications in terms of difficulty, efficiency, and of course cost. Thank you all.My Traiblazer 6 cyl was just fine, never felt the need to worry about performance increases. Are things going south?I’d bet a dozen donuts that the pcm place is worthless.  I’d be surprised if there was any inexpensive way to get hp, you typically need to add a turbo or a supercharger, at great expense.  Money would be better spent getting it in top mechanical condition.PCM4Less is a tuning company. You either go to their facility in Ohio or you send your engine control computer to them and they change the parameter file in the computer to boost whatever you ask them to try and boost, horsepower or mileage.
Since your 6 has no turbo or supercharger from the factory, there is little you can gain in HP. Turbo cars can command higher boost and therefore higher HP. Tunes can work very well for those engines. To boost HP on your 6, timing is increased and will require premium fuel all the time… for 10-15 hp added to your 270 hp.
As for other modifications… the follow-up question to “how much HP can I get” is  is always “how much can you spend?”
This is not  a popular engine, there are not too many parts available. To make more power, you’d need new cams, valvesprings, upgraded intake system and exhaust including headers. That, I’d estimate, is at least $3500 in parts alone and you’d need some dynomometer time to tune the engine computer to match the new parts. Labor you run another $1000 or so. Figure $500 for the dyno time and $500 for the guy that does the tune. That $5500 buys you maybe another 70 hp.
And this ALL depends on the condition of this 13 year old xxx,xxx mile (you don’t say) engine and transmission. Reality is not the same as TV, where cost is no object.I have a 2008  it is not lacking for power at 285 hp out of that great straight six they use in the platform .  If it has been any time at all since a tuneup  then go get 6  AC/Delco  41-103   iridium plugs  and install them .  It is never going to be thrifty , get at best  22-23  highway  on the 4.2 liter 6 .   Also  clean the throttle body   then reset the PCM   this will smooth out the idle .Those also came with 5.3L and 6.0L v8, right?  If you want more power, get one of those, if you want mpgs, keep yours and make sure it’s in top tune.


 Mustangman:

And this ALL depends on the condition of this 13 year old xxx,xxx mile (you don’t say) engine and transmission.


And, it should be noted that increasing the power output of a 13 year old engine is likely to make its remaining lifespan even shorter.
Additionally, there is the question of whether the 13 year old transmission would take kindly to efforts at stronger acceleration.
How often has the transmission been serviced over the years?
If it hasn’t been serviced at least 3 (preferably 4… ) times, the transmission is likely not long for this world, and forcing it to endure stronger acceleration runs will only shorten its life.If you want a noticeable boost in power, sell this one and fine a Trailblazer with the 6L LS2 engine. It has
390+ HP and 400 lb-ft torque.Also, do you live someplace that does not have emissions testing.  At more than one hp per cubic inchthat engine is already pretty efficient. The factory has already done all the cheap and easy stuff. Getting more will be expensive.  In the realm of 'If you have to ask, you can’t afford it.""The engine itself is at about 125,000. I think there may be a vaccum leak, and that’s a strong maybe, but other than that possibility, the engine is in great shape, with no problem or codes. I am the second owner of the vehicle and the previous owners actually kept record of having it serviced every step of the way. They had the money to do so. That’s partially why I was interested in doing a few things to it within reason. Thank you though for all the very much valued inputYes. I live in Florida. No emissions testing here.Nope. Things are actually great. The vehicle has no codes or problems. Anything wrong with it is just cosmetic, minus a potential vacuum leak.Is it getting close to its original mileage and performance or is something degraded?  Ensure that everything is operating correctly - good plugs and ignition system, clean and not worn injectors,  are inlet air controls, vacuum lines, EGR and oxygen sensor still good?  That’s the easy stuff.   As for modifications, its design was optimized for some combination of emissions, fuel economy, and performance - these interact, change one and something else is likely to go out of balance and you might not pass smog testing, or you might have premature cat. failure, etc.
Low risk mods that can add up:

Remove unnecessary weight - last winter’s chains, tools, rear seat, etc.
Mount quality, low rolling resistance tires,  consider inflating a few pounds over the nominal pressure (but nothing stupid).
Look for synthetic oil and gear lubes with published viscosities at the lower end of the allowed ranges, same for transmission fluid provided you can find a compatible type.   Change before worn out.
You might be able to reduce breathing losses at intake and exhaust, but be careful not to compromise filtering.
Changing driving habits can offer the biggest gain - drive smoothly and watch traffic and signals a quarter of a mile ahead to minimize unnecessary acceleration and braking.  In steady traffic, use the highest gear you can without lugging.  If you like gauges, mounting a manifold vacuum gauge and an instantaneous fuel consumption meter will tell you most of what you need to know.
Just small things like allowing the car to gradually slow ~ 5-8mph going up hills (traffic permitting) followed by running over by that much down hill (don’t get a ticket) can inprove mileage by ~ 10-15%, absolutely free and likely more than you’d realize from a tune.
Botard ( another screen name for the  list of strange ones ) did not ask about increasing Miles per Gallon , he wants more power out of a vehicle that very few people modify.


 VOLVO-V70:

did not ask about increasing Miles per Gallon


“… Even if I could go the other way, towards better gas milage, that would be fine as well.”Correct. It was mostly to see about increasing horsepower but I was curious to see what could be done in terms of more horsepower/less gas milage or the opposite. Thank you.The screen name, lol, was given to me by a friend back in middle school before I had my first email, haha. Obviously, I just decided to keep it. I think it has been used other places though.",,,,
260,1998 BMW 328 - Code,Maintenance/Repairs,51,1.6k,"P0121 code bit replacing throttle sensor didn’t help.
Idles smoothly but stutters at 1100 to 1500 rpm. Ok at highway speed.  Not vanos related. MAF replaced already too. Manifold air temperature part of maf.Sounds like an air leak, is it an M52 engine?Thank you for responding.
Yes. M52 engine. 160K miles. 2nd owner.
The mechanic tested for air leaks. None last week.
However,  today I think I’m hearing a lot more air whistling under the intake manifold.  Now suspecting the oil separator/ccv.  Bad diaphram?
I wish it were easy to unplug the oil separator from the manifold, and plug the manifold hole to confirm that’s my problem.  I just wanna fix the real problem.
What threw me is the bucking at city streets speed. 1200 RPM and light load.No problems, they did suffer from the pcv valve And pipes under the manifold, there not to bad a job if you’re replacing the pipes( there are 3) You can do it without taking the manifold off. The other things to check When you’re in there are the intake pipe after the air mass meter where it splits to the idle valve , and the DISA flap above the throttle body- they can have the flap fall off. I’m a BMW tech but we don’t see many in the network any more. Just shout if you need anything else Thank you for the comments.
A noisy signal in the TPS had been suggested. So I took unmounted it off the throttle body, and twisted the throttle up to 1200 RPM by hand: The huffing symptom persisted.  QED. (I assume a fall-back algorithms in the computer compensated for the incorrect TPS signal)
Removed ccv assembly and plugged the hole in the manifold: Huffing symptom persisted. QED.
I noticed the hose from the exhaust air pump solenoid control valve (the solenoid valve right next to the vanos solenoid valve)  to the check-valve was cracked and crumbly. The check-valve was dangling next to the block.
I’ll replace the hose(s) (the bad OEM hose was black with white stripe), and cross fingers.  I discovered the routing at
(https://www.realoem.com/bmw/enUS/showparts?id=CD33-USA-01-1998-E36-BMW-328i&diagId=11_6092 4)
Common problem or rare problem?
It’s a vacuum circuit I wasn’t expecting.  A smoke test probably wouldn’t have found it because there’s a check-valve in the line.
I wonder if there are any other vacuum circuits nobody knows about.
Why do you always find what you’re looking for in the last place you look?Yes it will run on a substitute value, we’ll done finding it👍Luckily we don’t see most of the emissions equipment seen on US carsIt took forever to discover that one line from the “T” goes to the vacuum reservoir on the Exhaust system page:


realoem.com 2



RealOEM.com - Online BMW Parts Catalog 2






Vacuum tested at the reservoir. Thankfully no leaks in that branch.
Should I use high-temperature silicone rubber hose?https://www.realoem.com/bmw/enUS/showparts?id=CD33-USA-01-1998-E36-BMW-328i&diagId=18_0236You did well tracing it, you might have a future a a Bmw parts advisor. There certainly not the easiest. Have a good weekend The vacuum control for the air injection is restored with better than average quality tubing.
Long term fuel trim went from -8.5% to zero.
I drove it a few miles. Still have pending P0121 TPS code, P1188 and P1189 mixture codes.
Still have some stutter at light to no pedal at 1200 RPM.
Still banging my head against a wall.
I discovered one connector not plugged into anything. It’s under the intake manifold.
The radio needs the key to turn it back on.
I think I’m not done.Still sounds like an air leak to me, does your scanner read live data? Can y see what the air flow meter is reading?The app can hook readings to a value display, or to a dial or graph.
The #2 oxygen sensors are now far less erratic.  Under some driving conditions and at idle they’ll settle down at around 0.5V±0.1. They slammed from rail to rail before.
Charcoal canister input?  I can’t figure out where that is.
The vacuum line from the vacuum reservoir goes to a box under the fuse box against the firewall.  Is that routing of the vacuum line to the trunk?At warm idle you should see 14kg/h from the airflow meter if not unplug it and try it, they have a habit of not storing a code , when unplugged they should run slightly richer. The charcoal canister is the right behind the rear wheel arch liner from memory. If you sespect a vacuum line issue get a short length if and cut bits stick a bolt in the end remove the one from the car and blank them off. The ones I’ve worked on have no vacuum pipes going to the bulkhead ( maybe emission related?).https://www.bimmerfest.com/threads/97-328i-p1765-p0121-codes.672862/page-2
matches my symptoms of ASC light on, stuttering, and p0121 code.
The thread said the gas-tank pressure sensor was loading the 5V reference for the TPS. The sensor is located, unfortunately, in the RH wheel well behind a mud flap, and on the back side of the overflow tank where you can’t reach it.
Hoping for a clean job. Noooo… no today.
The input to the TPS was about 5.02V with or without the tank pressure sensor in circuit.  With it disconnected, the surging symptom is still there.
[i.e. Smooth idle, but advance the throttle to raise the RPM to about 1200, and the motor starts surging or “huffing.” The air sucking noise sounds like it’s coming from under the intake manifold near cyl #4. No significant fluctuation of the mpg dial under the speedometer either]
Another dead end.  I had such high hopes.
12.3 KG/hour MAF value (34.16g/s)  at idle.   That’s 12% low.  Still an air leak?
The long term fuel trim is now zero%  (was -8.59% prior to replacing those vac tubes)
The ACS warning light in the bottom middle of the instrument cluster always comes on a few minutes after start-up.  I have a feeling it’s a real part of the problem.
I’m pretty convinced the TPS sensor produces a constant, noise-free signal when the engine is making the huff, huff, huff surging noise.
It idles smoothly, so I haven’t been motivated to clean the idle control valve.
I don’t have an extra MAF to try.
Should the car start up with the MAF disconnected?  This one doesn’t. A youtube video showed an E36 m3 starting with the MAF disconnected.One more thing. I found a plug dangling from the bundle of wires under the intake manifold next to the block. It looked like it hadn’t been plugged into anything for a long time. Are all the plugs supposed to be plugged into some solenoid or sensor?
I don’t think it’s related to the surging problem because that was sudden onset only a couple of tanks of gas ago.If it’s a two pin rectangular one it’s probably the air temperature sensor, they were only on the old m50’s but looms still had the wiringThe manifold air temperature sensor is along the bottom of the manifold next to the vacuum line to the reservoir with the branch to the exhaust air injection control valve. With the throttle body off, you can see it sticking up into the air path.  I took it out when trying to push the tube onto the nipple on the manifold; it was in the way.  It’s connected, and I can read it from the OBD-ii scanner.

page 58 implies that the engine should continue to run if the MAF is unplugged,
but it will quit if the IAC valve ‘has a problem’.
So I guess I’ll try to clean it.Is the IAC valve cleanable? or is it prudent to replace it?
How about the MAF reading at idle being 12% low?Sorry that’s taken a while I’m out of town, IAC valve usually just needs a clean, either brake or carb cleaner. This only affects the idle so unless it’s stuck open it shouldn’t mess with the throttle  response.
You should read around 14 kgs unless the car is almost stalling. Like you said unplug the air mass meter and it should run a lot better if that’s the issue.To eliminate any question, I replaced the IAC. (more $ than I like, but the bees paid for it out of honey sales)
The moving part in the middle of the IAC  didn’t appear to be sticky or gummed up.
The MAF reading  increased to about 14.4KG/h.
I assume reducing the air leaks cause the MAF reading to increase.
When I unplug the MAF, and I start the car,  it runs for a few seconds and dies;  does that mean I still have a sizable air leak?
When the engine is idling, when the MAF is unplugged, it dies.
When I drive it, the bucking/surging is reduced by 80 to 90%.
The ACS warning light keeps coming on. Is that related or a separate problem?
I’m gonna search for ACS & P0121 reading this evening.  Possibly related.
the dangling plug went to a one-pin connector near the generator.
Can’t figure out what it is. I remember now disconnecting it so I could get my hand in the space around the oil separator.
thank you for your patience and suggestions.",,,,
261,1993 Toyota Camry doesn’t want to start in wet conditions,Maintenance/Repairs,5,225,"Starts fine when it’s dry out but doesn’t want to start when it’s wet & drizzly (btw: in Seattle, wet & drizzly is our winter thing).  The engine spins fine & fast for as long as the battery holds out but doesn’t “catch”.  If it does happen to start (usually but using the flooded engine, hold the gas pedal floored while cranking maneuver from the owner’s manual), it runs rough & try’s to stall requiring constant gas pedal management until it warms all the way up & then it’s fine.I suspect it is due to old ignition wires.“Purebred’s”  suggestion is always a good place to start if the wires are old. Even if the wires are not the culprit, they are a maintenance item with a shorter life. That is, it is good prophylactic medicine. (Jokes, please…)
Before you replace them, try to start your car on a cold, rainy night while someone is looking under the hood at the ignition items.  Sparks can sometimes be seen, which help diagnose the problem.I’m going to go a different direction and say you have a cracked distributor cap.You might try wiping down both the inside and outside of the distributor cap with dielectric grease.
What can happen is that when an engine is shut off the warmth can attract moisture in the air and this can essentially kill the spark inside the cap. Moisture will accumulate inside the cap much like a window in a house can sweat on the inside.
Next time it won’t start in damp conditions pop the distributor cap loose and take a look inside for moisture.
If the plugs and wires are old then those should be replaced also.Next time ir rains, spray your cap and wires with WD40 or silicone spray.  If that lets it start, replace the cap and wires.",,,,

263,Ford Ranger 2001 Lean on Bank 1,Power/Fuel,13,210,"Hello, I have a 2001 Ford Ranger. It is a 4.0 and has a little over 200,000 miles on it. I have spent more money on mechanics that havent fixed the issue then the truck is probably worth. I have fixed the spark plugs, spark plug wires, fuel filter, mass air flow system, all o2 sensors, coil pack, taken cat off and looked at it and cleaned it. I have loss of power going up hills or when its cold out. I can reach 35-40 mph tops going up hill. And my truck shakes when I accelerate. Could it be a vacuum leak or a bad fuel injector? I cannot afford to keep bringing it back to the garage so my dad who is really good at working on vehicles is going to fix it. We are just trying to figure out what it is before we replace another thing that isnt the problem. Thanks in advance! Also the 3 codes I had before I replaced the fuel filter were : P0171, P0442, P1131. After repkacing fuel filter it seemed okay that day then the light came back on and started acting up again.Your title says lean bank 1 but you don’t tell us how you know that nor the OBD2 code that you are reading. You’ve just told us a bunch of replaced parts but no reason for replacement. Were these parts determined to be bad or were they just replaced blindly in an attempt to get this truck to run?
Cleaning a catalytic converter is a waste of time. If they clog, they won’t clean and if they stop working, cleaning won’t help either.
Based on this, have you run a compression test? It is key to determining if the engine itself is in good enough condition to warrant replacing any more parts.These parts were replaced by a mechanic. We replaced the fuel filter ourselves. I wrote the codes after realizing I forgot them. It has 3 codes.I am new to this. I will try to do a better job giving more information.


 Michaela.osgood1313_172630:

It has 3 codes.


So give them to us.
AND answer this…



 Mustangman:

have you run a compression test?

The codes are listed in my main post… P0171, P0442, and P1131.
I cannot answer the compression test question until I talk to him because I am not certain if the mechanic did it or not when replacing other stuff. He just said that based on my back bed he wouldnt put alot of money into it unless I am going to run it as a farm vehicle.


 Michaela.osgood1313_172630:

codes are listed in my main post… P0171, P0442, and P1131


Not in the original post, only the edited one. You have an evap leak that needs a smoke test. And you engine is showing a lean condition on bank 1. Sounds like the mechanic threw parts at it hoping the problem would go away rather than actually finding the cause. I could be wrong, but if he didn’t run a compression test when the plugs were out, you should find a better mechanic.



 Michaela.osgood1313_172630:

just said that based on my back bed


What does that mean? A rusty truck bed?Yes my back bed is really rusty. And yes I agree a better mechanic is needed. The evap leak has nothing to do with it running lean on bank 1 though correct?


 Michaela.osgood1313_172630:

Yes my back bed is really rusty.


If the truck bed is rusty enough for a mechanic to say he would not put money into the vehicle then there may be rust on parts that make this thing unsafe.He said not to put money into it unless im going to replace the back bed with a flat bed. He said the rest of the truck is fine. He just based on miles and the back bed he didnt want me to waste my money fixing it when it may not be worth it at 200,000 miles.Compression test will give you the answer or the next step to take.Have you checked fuel pressure?We had bad o-rings on the plenum that threw that code.Connect a fuel pressure gauge and monitor the fuel pressure while driving up hill.

266,2011 Hyundai Accent - Squeal/whistle,Maintenance/Repairs,2,116,"Good morning -
I have a question about a noise my '11 Hyundai Accent started making about a month ago, when the weather here started getting colder. Sometimes when I first start the car, the first few turns - which are usually at a more pronounced angle - create a sort of squealing/whistling noise from the front-right quadrant of the vehicle. The noise goes away when i’m actually driving and only returns if I’m making another full turn (say out of a parking lot) but it doesn’t always happen, both at first or after later stops. I would say the noise occurs roughly 50% of the time.
Additionally, once or twice I have heard the noise on first starting the car, before I’ve moved it at all, and that makes me think it’s belt-related. That has only happened maybe 5% of the time, though. Given that, and the turn-related symptoms I suspected the power steering pump belt or the serpentine belt might be having issues, but when I had my car inspected a couple of months ago they replaced all of my drive/V-belts because they were worn. My power steering fluid level was also checked and it’s fine.
The sound is the same as what I would hear in the past when driving through a really big puddle at lower speed, which I attributed to water splashing up onto the belt from below. The sound does not seem to ever happen when i’m driving more than 15 mph, but then most turns I’m making at higher speeds (off-ramps, on-ramps) are usually not suddenly pronounced, but more gradual.
I’m going to have it looked at by the same folks who did the belt replacement, but I’m just trying to get an idea ahead of time of what I’m likely looking at, repair- and $-wise. If they just need to reseat one of the belts or change/adjust a tensioner, I’m guessing it probably won’t be much more than having them replaced initially to begin with. Is it possible this is solely due to the cold weather? I’ll also note the car only gets driven 1-2 times a week as I am working from home currently, and when not being driven it is kept in a garage and not outside.
Any and all help is appreciated!I suppose the mechanic put on the lowest quality belt he could find.Get a premium one and you will never hear this noise again.Gates belts are very good.When a vehicle of your age has the serpentine belt replaced, it’s also recommended that the belt tensioner also be replaced to prevent any noise.

Rebuilt transmission or rebuilt vehicle with a Salvage title ?  Either one I would avoid .  But if you really want it pay a shop to look it over and then  decideIf you’re talking about the car having a rebuilt transmission I wouldn’t worry, as long as the car checks out. OTOH, as Volvo says, if the car has been rebuilt steer clear.Rebuilt title i’d stay away from, a friend has a '15 Fit EX-L CVT made in Mexico and for the last 5 or so years he’s simply had to maintain the car. Holding up very well to a 90mi round trip commute. No real difference to his past Japan built Honda’s.2017 Fit looks ok, but stay away from the 2015:

272,Towing for plowing,General Discussion,16,681,"our city tows cars on street for snow emergencies. usually $250 with tow/impound/ticket. how about city having tow companies move the cars from bad side of street to good side? and send owner a bill for $50? and pay tow company XX dollars for each towed car? tow company has to haul car xx miles and it takes xx minutes for round trip. i bet they could move a lot more cars per hours if they only moved them 300ft? odds of damage are lessened with 300ft tow vs a 10mile trip to yard?Because people park on both sides of the street, so you’d have to move the right side of the street over to the left, and then move the left side to the right, including all the cars you just moved, for the plow to do the other side.
As for damage, most of the damage you cause when towing a car is going to happen during or shortly after the hookup to the tow truck due to operator error. Once it’s hooked and moving, assuming it was done properly, there’s not much difference between 300 feet and 30 miles.
Plus, snow emergencies are declared and winter parking policies are clearly spelled out, usually in easy to read signage that the idiots are parking right under. $250 is a good incentive not to be a jerk again. It’s one of the few ways we’re still fighting the “I’m so special that the rules don’t apply to me, screw everyone else” attitude that’s become more and more prevalent over the years.i thought it was even side/odd side but some streets have no parking on both sides till plowed. i think our city has signs that say night plow or something like that. and the streets that dont have signs are different. been awhile since i looked at the signs

It seems that a growing number of people think that rules and laws don’t apply to them.At $50 many folks would be happy to pay, creating more of a problem.Because then the number of violators would probably triple.Have you ever tried to parallel park a trailer or a towed vehicle?The towing company would have to move the cars back and forth each time the plows go through. This sounds like more chance of damage, not less.I showed up 10 minutes late to find my car gone form a no parking 4:30 to 7:30 pm. Car gone now what. Luckily I had a sticker on my back window from the 99th Infantry. We started walking towards the police station, and I see my car on a side street. I think they must clear all the cars then tow them to the yard. Perfect window of opportunity for me, I had a ticket, 75 or 125 dollars don’t recall. We hopped in the car and took off. Lucky we walked the right way and noticed the car.off street parking is nice.That’s a good common sense solution.  The problem is common-sense among most city officials isn’t very common.   I’ve seen city officials spend hours and hours at town-meetings debating on whether a pot hole is bad enough to repair or not.  With the amount of money the officials were paid for their time  to hold the debate they could have filled the pothole and then some.Luckily we d not have to go through council, city has an app, turn on gps, submit it and they fix it. One was a washout next to a storm manhole due to sewer collapse they put in 3 new catchbasins, a new manhole, replaced the collapsed corrugated pipe. There was a ""hole in the pavement with a 1 foot void underneath. Another was for potholes in our street. Took a couple of weeks but got filled in. Makes me feel pretty damn happy! Another was streetlight out, fixed within a week.Towing is big business.  At work, the street used to go to no parking at 4:00 and the ole tow trucks would be lined up licking their lips.  Yeah plus if its congested, pretty hard to park them again nearby.
Happily I’m running out of stories and probably I’m repeating them.  In school we had a U shaped entrance to the wife’s dorm and of course it was marked as a fire lane that everyone ignored.  So I was parked there about ten minutes and I came out to the tow truck hooking me up.  He wouldn’t let it down again but I just rode down with him to the station, paid my $10 towing fee (this was 1969) and on my way again.
Of course I was a little angry so I went to see the Admin Director to complain.  He said yeah I’m really sorry but they are making us keep the fire lanes clear.  Then he said if you think you are mad, you should have seen Loretta (Dean of Students) when we towed her.  Picture a larger Miss Piggy and you’ll get the picture.  What did I say?  What could I say?  The poor guy.  Of course years later I was in the same boat.It depends on the officer I imagine. So I was in a no parking fire lane waiting for people to come out of the theater, Officer friendly says you have to move. I said ok, sorry I did not realize sitting in a car waiting was parking, he said it is and you need to move, so I did. Been to the airport often enough where no parking passenger pickup only meant if you were in the car it was fine.Because the taxpayer isn’t responsible for a piece of metal with tires.  Even/odd applies to street sweeping.  Doesn’t matter if they can’t get both sides the same day.  Personaly i believe they should charge double for snow days.

273,Clunking/bumping sound from front end,Maintenance/Repairs,5,175,"I bought a 2017 Ford Escape SE that looked very well maintained with less than 82000 miles on it.  After driving it for a while, we began to notice a bumping/clunking sound when going over bumps in the road.  These sometimes sounded as if the struts were bottoming out.  I did some research, which appeared to indicate the stabilizer link bars were bad.  So I replaced them.  I did a test drive, and though the noise has seemed to lessened, I do still hear it at times.  I especially noticed it when slowing in the drive way.  I noticed when applying the brakes to stop at very slow speeds, a clunk sound immediately sounded and again when released.  Not saying the brakes are my culprit at all since the sound happens while driving over bumps, but is it possible the sway bar bushings themselves went bad due to bad link bars left unaddressed?  If so, where are the locations of these bushings?  I noticed the sway bar went above the control arm in back behind the engine housing, so are these going to be a beast to deal with?  Any help is appreciated and thanks in advance.I dunno, once a stabilizer link goes bad, the stabilizer bar kinda just sits there not doing as much as it usually does. It sees more stress with good links because they’re doing their job and transmitting forces to the bar. That’s not to say the bushings aren’t bad, and you should certainly check them, but I’d find it odd for 3 year old bushings to die, even on an Escape which is not the best-built car out there. I’ve had cars with factory stabilizer bar bushings that hadn’t gone bad after 20-30 years.
I’d be looking at things like ball joints, strut mounts, etc. And I’d be doing it quick-like, and taking it to an expert if I couldn’t find something fast, because some things that go “clunk” in the front are warning signs that you’re about to have a significant suspension failure, which could make you crash.I here it when applying the break and putting the car in gear.  Not so much when moving.  Just went out an checked again.Not sure about the links going bad after 3 years, but everything I have seen on the net indicates they are prone to failure.  The old moved easily and the new ones were stiff.Believe I found my problem.  Bolt missing out of the lower control arm and is laying on the dust shield.  SMH.  This was apparently worked on previously, but not very well…Ok, found the right side was missing both bolts that bolted the lower control arm to the front of the frame and it was dangling.  Replaced those, checked the other side and one missing their also.  Replaced it.  95% of the clunking/banging is gone, however, still have a clank when I hit a big enough pot hole/sudden difference in pavement level.  What am I missing?  I noticed a brace going up towards the motor, is this a motor mount issue?",,,,

100 mph into a utility pole on Nov. 17, breaking the pole and spraying
hundreds of small batteries through the windows of two nearby
residences. One landed on a bed, starting a fire in the bedsheets,
KMTR reported. A tire from the car struck the second story of a nearby
apartment building so forcefully it broke water pipes inside the wall,
destroying the bathroom on the other side and causing flooding in the
lower level, police said. Citizens were warned not to pick up any
stray batteries, which can stay hot for up to 24 hours and release
toxic fumes. Milota fled on foot but was quickly apprehended and
charged with various offenses.
From this week's Weird NewsWhat’s weird to me is someone fleeing the scene on foot after a 100 mph collision with a utility pole. I’m not surprised with an accident caused by an intoxicated driver.My old company made machine to assemble Tesla battery trays. I had a box of 1000 batteries in our lab. Who knew it was so dangerous?

I make it a practice to fact check the stuff I hear about in the news and what I learned was he was going 100 mph when he lost control.  He may have slowed down considerably before the impact since the photo of the wreckage shows that he was skidding sideways on impact.  The photo of the wrecked car looks like it was a survivable collision with little damage to the driver’s compartment.  The ability to flee on foot seems entirely plausible to me after studying the photo.
Another factual error in that report is the statement that over 1000 “batteries” were strewn over the area of the wreck.  A Tesla only has one battery consisting of about 7000 cells.
JRRRG57WN5CSPKDSSGSRYIBJHY.JPG (1280×853) (oregonlive.com) 10A side impact may mean that there was still considerable forward velocity, but not much sideward velocity, making damage much less than if it had been a head on collision with the pole.
Stopping distance increases with the square of the speed. The same distance to stop a car from 50 would only reduce the speed to around 70 from 100. An accident at 70 is still might damaging.Whatever happened it’s clearly the jackass driver that’s at fault.  If it was a gasoline fueled car I can imagine a big fire as well as flying debris.I’m amazed that Tesla didn’t catch fire.  A friend of ours who owned a Tesla had a traffic accident which totaled the car because the battery caught on fire after the crash.  Lithium-ion battery fires are no joke.
I have heard that it’s standard operating procedure to put any Tesla that’s been in a crash in a 48 hour quarantine in a safe spot lest latent damage to the battery causes a battery fire.


 B.L.E:

We’ve been saying battery when we mean cell forever.Dry cell manufacturers have been using the term battery incorrectly for over a hundred years.  We had a lot of old Popular Science and Mechanic Illistrated magazines around when I was a kid.  There was an advertisement with an endorsement for Everready flashlight “batteries” from a surviving officer of the Titanic.
Thousands of cells wired together. Imagine crushing them into tight bundle. All these wires compressed and shredding the insulation. Potential short circuit? I imagine so.If a lithium ion cell reaches a critical temperature, it will internally short and burst into flames even without an external short and then overheat the cells next to it.

Instead of WD-40, you should use penetrating oil.

If you don’t have an impact tool to use, I’d try PB Blaster instead of WD 40, it’s a lot more effective of a penetrating oil
Edit: @VDCdriver has good advice with Liquid Wrench too. I would trust either of them over WD-40Try grabbing the screw head with vise grips. If you can get hold of it you can unscrew it like a bolt.

Agree, WD is a water dispersant not a rust penetrant.  Don’t these screw into plastic inserts?  Haven’t seen metal in years.  Suggest changing the screws to hex head instead and $100 at ACE will get you a nice battery operated impact driver.

I would suggest you do the same.Time for the 2 piece wrench .   You take a screw driver , place it against the side of the screw , tap the handle with a hammer to make a dent and then at an angle you just keep tapping until the screw works loose and turns .Once you get these screws loose, assuming the screws go into metal, I suggest putting anti-seize compound on the new screws and also making yourself a note to loosen and retighten them periodically. That’s what I had to do with my wife’s previous car (a BMW if it matters).Thank you everyone.  Lots of good suggestions.  I appreciate the help. I can sympathize because I had the same problem a couple of months ago.  I was going to use my Dremel tool to cut a deep slot in the bolt, spray it with PB Blaster and see if I could get the bolt free.  We had had the same license plates on our 2003 Toyota 4Runner for at least five years–we just got a renewal sticker every year.
However,  I suffer with Geezeritis and Medicare won’t pay for Geritol®, and the main symptom of Geezeritis is laziness. I drove over to a body shop a half mile from my house that has done work for me in the past.  The technician used a pneumatic powered cutting wheel to cut a new slot in the bolt.  He had the old plate off and the new plate installed in five minutes.  There was no charge and the shop wouldn’t even let me make a contribution to their coffee fund.    The shop even put in new bolts.

Last year when we bought my wife’s Hyundai I wanted to do the same. The “helpful” lady at Ace Hardware saw me testing one of the existing bolts (which I subsequently learned are 6mm) to see what size it was and asked me what the bolt was for. She then directed me to zinc plated, rust prone “license plate screws.” I thanked her, waited until she went to “help” someone else, walked out without the screws, and went somewhere else.


 GorehamJ:

I went a step further and stripped the Phillips screw head.


Using the correct size Phillips screw driver improves the odds of loosening those screws. Most people have a No 1 and No 2 Phillips but license plate screws are usually No 3 Phillips, the fit between the tool and screw is much better with the correct screw driver.@Nevada_545  I actually have the right sized Phillips screwdriver.  But the screws are frozen tight.  At least against the weak strength of my arthritic hands.
I even checked if my dad’s old socket wrench set has any socket heads large enough to fit the screwdriver handle so I can get more torque but alas the handle is too large for even the biggest socket head.
Seems I’ll be making a pilgramage to the hardware store for the advised proper supplies.  sigh

Exactly. PB Blaster works great. Or sometimes you need to take drastic measures.Harbor Freight grinder $9.99 plus $1.99 for the wheel. Take along a 20% coupon.

The front plate screws into the plastic bumper so I could do those by hand but had to wait so I had the matching new plates on the car.
As @Nevada_545 notes, the rear plate screws into the trunk lid.  There was no rust.  But mercy those two screws were locked tight.
I actually broke my dad’s largest Phillips screwdriver this morning trying to get those two screws out.  The handle now loosely spins around the metal shaft.  Oh well, it’s about as old as I am, 65, so I suppose it has earned its retirement.  But, darn it, that was my late dad’s tool I broke.

279,"Education, Degrees, Automotive Maintenance",General Discussion,69,1.7k,"Hello,
I was thinking of possibly getting an associates degree in automotives so that way I can learn how to do more of my own maintenance on my own vehicle. I would be taking this at a community college because it’s cheaper. I already have a full time job in a different industry. I plan on working my full time job and taking classes in the afternoon. I have degrees in other subjects.
Is this possible and are there any specific degrees that I should avoid or considering getting?
Thanks for help.Quick answer: take everything automotive that the college offers. I did that in the 70’s and have saved a fortune as a DIY-er.  In addition, take an intro physics course.Why do you think you need a degree for that ?  There are so few things to for maintenance on modern vehicles that You Tube can help with most of them .  Then there is proper disposal of fluids ( coolant - brake - transmission ) that it is sometimes simpler to just have it done and you will not have tools that you only use seldom.
Or are you talking about major repair .@YoshiMoshi3:
I fully support your goal.
I did this in the reverse of what you’re asking, (first auto degree, then other degrees).  The automotive degree continues to be valuable, 40+ years later.  It not only gave me a deep rooted understanding of cars & trucks, but it also enabled me to learn and understand mechanical, electrical, and industrial systems well beyond the automotive field.
Realize that not all automotive schools are created equal.  Be careful of the “for profit” schools.     I would look for a school that provides a good mix of class course work and shop time.
All the best.


 JoeMario:

It goes without saying that any for-profit “school” of any type should be avoided like a disease.  Most for-profit “schools” do little more than provide training of dubious value, and load their students up with debt that will haunt them for years.  The “degree” or “certification” is often not accepted by employers, or if it is accepted, it is treated as less than a degree from a state university or community college.
There is literally no better bang-for-the-buck than taking classes at a local community college.  I learned HVAC and refrigeration at a community college and earned an Associate’s in Applied Science, and never had any prospective employer doubt my qualifications.Most just for my own knowledge increase. Youtube videos I have learned a lot from, as well as a lot from the people on these forums. I’m not sure if formal education would be even more beneficial?
Also I’m seeing that most of these schools require “practicum” which sounds like an internship type deal. Where you 100 hours counts as one credit. Is this typical for these types of programs? Because this sounds like something I cannot get while working a full time job outside of school.
I was looking at some “Automotive Technology: Comprehensive Automotive Repair and Service (CARS), AAS” Thankfully I would imagine all my credits from my other degrees would count towards the general education, math, english, all that stuff I wouldn’t have to take it seems, and would be taking strictly automotive classes, which is what I want.


 YoshiMoshi3:

are there any specific degrees that I should avoid or considering getting?


You’ve already made the 1st and smartest choice by NOT attending a for-profit automotive “institute”
That already puts you WAY ahead of a lot of other folks
Since you already have other degrees, I’ll assume you’re a pretty good learner.  That already puts you at an advantage, versus some other guys.  No offense to anybody reading this, but we all know we’re not all the same when it comes to learning, studying, knowledge retention, etc.
Of course it should be possible to take community colleges towards an automotive degree
If anything, the instructor(s) might be happy to see an older . . . I assume you’re not that young, since you already have multiple degrees in other fields . . . student attending
Don’t bother mentioning your reason(s) for attending.  That’s not really that important, in my opinion.  Besides, if you do, the other students may not take you as seriously, if you care about that kind of thing.  Best to not let it even be a subject of conversation, if you ask me.  Plenty of guys make mid-life career changes, and for all everybody else knows, that’s why you’ll be attending



 YoshiMoshi3:

I’m not sure if formal education would be even more beneficial?


Yes, it will be beneficial . . . because you’ll learn the fundamentals.  In other words, you’ll learn why things are the way they are and how things work.  That beats merely knowing how to fix something.

Here’s the thing about youtube . . .  while it’s entertaining and there IS some good stuff out there, it’s not all correct.  And some of those guys only show you how to fix things, without explaining how it works.

I really like this idea.An all around excellent idea and an excellent comprehensive approach to understanding what in reality is a very complex system. And taking advantage of the organized approach offered at your publicly subsidized Community Colleges is the most cost effective way to do it.
Whether you actually earn a specific degree is beside the point because your goal is personal knowledge, which may also lead you into other areas of interest. Physics, programming, electronics, materials engineering, chemistry, etc., which are all part of that thing we call a car.Not sure, but I think our state (community) college offers automotive course as vocational rather than degree courses.Ours offers an Associate of Applied Science degree in automotive, the intro program. There is an evening program offered in Automotive there.The big question is whether the program you are considering will lead to some type of accredited certification such as ASE.  Your community college may even offer the ASE certification test as part of their services.If your goal is to work in the field, the ASE accreditation would be excellent. If you are doing this simply for your own interests, forget about getting a degree. Take only the courses you want.  (That advice will not work if the courses are only open to degree students. But even then, talk to the supervisor, since that kind of rule can be bent for someone who has a degree.)Agree with everything written here.  My local junior college has a excellent automotive program.  Unfortunately it is virtually shut down due to Covid.  Nearly all automotive classes have labs, and the college is not operating any labs during Covid.   I fear that the program will be devastated if the instructors all find other employment.
I am a semi-retired mechanical engineer and my wife makes me take classes to keep me off the sofa.  I have taken a number of automotive classes that were very good.
My local JC has several automotive classes that are sponsored by Ford.  All the students are on Ford grants and they work internships at local Ford dealerships.  Those classes focus on Ford products and are closed to students not in that program.

A guy needs to have some verified experience working in a shop before he can actually gain ASE certification  . . . as far as I know



 Manolito:

No offense intended to anybody . . . but I would like it better if an automotive program at a community college were NOT affiliated with an auto manufacturer
I’ve found that the most learning takes place when a guy is forced to work on ALL brands . . . because that more closely mimics the real world, in my opinion
In my experience, the best mechanics were often the guys that have “been there done that” and had worked in various settings.  Dealer, independent, fleet, government, etc.
I’m obviously a little biased, but aren’t we all . . . ?!Referring to the Ford  Asset program which has been around for years, I believe you have to be sponsored by a Ford dealer to get into the program. it’s an addition to the programs for any makes/models. Ford donates vehicles for the students to train with.  At Renton Technical College in 04-05 there were two shops for Auto tech and the asset program had their own space.
Ase has an entry level certification for those just starting out. You can move up from there.When it comes to obtaining automotive mechanical knowledge hands-on cannot be outdone. Schooling certainly does not hurt but there are a few caveats.
One is the competency of the instructor and how well he or she manages to get their points across.
The other is that some people are good test takers and some are not. This means that Very Competent Person A may fail a test and Not Competent Person B may ace the test.
I do not know if they still do this or not but when I first started working for VW I had to attend school for 3 hours every Thursday night for quite a few months.My opinion: experience is 85%. Education is 15% and that 15% goes a long way to getting 100%.

I agree with you, but we live in a world where certificates/degrees trump experience and natural ability.Nothing wrong with both experience and education.",,,,
280,2AZ-FE Motor Mount Replacement,Maintenance/Repairs,9,426,"I have a 2005 Toyota Camry with the 2AZ-FE engine and U250E automatic transmission. This is the four cylinder model which has four motor/transmission mounts. One close to each of the two front tires, one in the front of the car near the radiator and a torque mount at the top of the engine that is easily accessible.
I found this video on youtube which does a good job showing how to do it.
Engine & Transmission Mounts Replacement - Toyota Camry
Do I have to loosen the top nut on the threaded rod on the front motor mount while removing the nut on either of the other lower motor mounts?
Would I have issues with moving the engine/transmission up a little if I did it one at time (leaving the front motor mount alone until removing it)? I’m a bit uneasy with lifting up the engine slightly with the torque motor mount completely removed, and a partially removed nut on the front motor mount, and then completely removing the right motor mount. For example when removing the right motor mount, the only thing holding up the engine and transmission would be the transmission mount, and the front motor mount with a partially removed nut.
I would prefer this, is this possible?

Remove torque motor mount.
Remove motor mount on the same side as the torque motor mount.
Install new motor mount.
Install new torque motor mount.
Remove front motor mount
Install new motor mount.
Remove transmission mount
Install new transmission mount.

As opposed to this:

Remove torque motor mount.
Loosen the nut on the front motor mount so that way it’s still on the threaded rod
Remove motor mount on the same side as the torque motor mount.
Install new motor mount.
Install new torque motor mount.
Remove transmission mount
Install new transmission mount.
Completely remove the nut on the threaded rod on the front transmission mount.
Install new front motor mount.

Also out of curiosity. You’ll see in the thumbnail of the video, the lower motor mount for the engine (not the front one) does not have a dust boot. Nor did the one that came from the factory. However for some reason the guy in this video seems to put an old one on. Is this really necessary.

What about the hydraulic jack underneath?

What about the hydraulic jack underneath?


That just makes it look too easyThanks guys.
I finally got around to attempting this myself. I decided not to finish it because I didn’t feel comfortable with the floor jack. The engine was starting to tilt backwards a bit while I was trying to jack it up to replace the mounts.
Are there more secure methods of lifting/tilting up the engine?
A floor jack with a block of wood on it is to risky for me. I’m afraid of dropping the engine or having it tilt while jacking it up. I’m scared of dropping the engine, or having it tilt to far and breaking something else.Rent an engine hoist?
image1000×1000 77.3 KBDo you have engine lift hooks on the engine? If so, you might want to put together some lumber across the inside of the fenders, and use a heavy eye bolt attached to the lift hooks. (drill a hole in the timber for the eye bolt, and use washers).
I did this a few years ago, when I had to lift the engine of my Celica in order to change the oil pan gasket.
Notice the missing strut mount on the passenger side. I’m installing KYB strut inserts, while I accumulate funds for a timing chain R&R. We are getting another stimulus check, right? 
:Engine Lift2592×1944 1.26 MBYou don’t need an engine hoist to do motor mounts
You just need jack stands, a jack, that block of wood, some common sense . . . and a little faith
The motor will NOT fall out of the car, because only mount will be replaced at a time, correct?
I’ve done plenty of motor mounts in my driveway, both transverse and longitudinally mounted engines



 tom418:

this is going to get political and ugly REAL soon, if we take this and run with it . . . We used the wood block method changing motor mounts on a 327 Chevy, friend got his arm caught when engine fell.  Fortunately his arm eas in a space, not damage done to him, but trapped until we got the engine jacked up again.
What would be fun the the Camry, put in a real FE engine, 428 Cobra Jet…There are no eye hooks on my engine, as far as I know. It’s the 2AZ-FE engine.
The video on found on youtube (in the first post), they loosened the top nut holding engine to mount on the middle lower motor mount, and then the driver side one. Replaced the engine mount. Then replaced the transmission mount. then replaced the front mount.
It’s possible to remove the right hand side engine mount without loosening the nut on the front engine mount? I’d much rather do that.Some parts stores rent engine supports.

TesterI believe that Tester’s pic shows the starter location on the Cadillac Northstar engine.
Since GM used to refer to that marque as the “world standard of excellence”, I guess that this bizarre starter placement represented the world standard of engine design.

It only take 10 minutes to remove the bumper cover. The real labor is with some vehicles the multi-meter radar sensor is mounted to the bumper cover/grill assembly and must be calibrated after each remove and install of the bumper cover.

Yeah that’s where the starter was on my Olds V8.  Luckily it never had to be replaced.  Now replacing the serpentine belt is about an hour WITH the factory manual.  I’m sure others could do it faster though.An Hour for a serpentine belt? Why so hard?


 Barkydog:

An Hour for a serpentine belt? Why so hard?


Searching memory banks.  Because there was no way or room to get it off and the new one on again.  You had about a 1""x 1/2"" opening that it had to be threaded through.  The procedure is detailed in the service manual.  Kinda like the radiator has to come out the bottom on a lift. Or the alternator.  Not to mention the trans has to be removed to clean the EGR passages.  So rest in peace.  Been good to know ya.

282,Engaging 4WD in older Chevy Pickup,Maintenance/Repairs,17,34.6k,"I just bought a 1991 Chevrolet K1500 and I have a question about the 4WD. Can I switch to 4-high “on the fly”–as in while the vehicle is moving–or do I have to be parked/stopped/or in neutral? The guy at the used car lot didn’t seem to know for sure, but my neighbor said “no problem,” to shift it to 4-high from 2WD as long as I’m not going too fast. Is this true? I don’t want to trash my car! I don’t know much about 4WD on older cars. I’m used to “push button” 4WD on newer models. Also, what’s the highest safe speed for 4WD? High and low…Thanks!Would you like to be safe or sorry? Check the owner’s manual if there is one. I have driven a Ford at 40 MPH on really icy roads and hills with ordinary tires and had no problem. 4L would be kind of risky when moving. 4H you could probably do when moving.Maybe the manual is in the dash, we have a few gmc vehicles of that era and have always engaged 4wd before moving, 4wd should be used cautiously and sparingly imho. 4 lo you will not need unless pulling a boat out of a sandy launch etc. In fact I would skip using 4wd except when absolutely necessary and never over 40 mph. But then again that is my experience with early 90’s vintage vehicles still working fine.You should be able to shift between 2H and 4H on the fly as long as you are going straight ahead and all the wheels have equal traction. Now if your vehicle has some sort of “automatic locking hubs” you must stop first as the front axle is not “live” until SOMETHING engages the front hubs. Your truck may have a live axle which is engaged all the time, 2-wheel or 4 wheel drive…On older trucks, many were equipped with manually locking hubs where you had to stop and get out and lock or unlock the front hubs…SERIOUS off-roaders still favor this fool-proof set-up…
You can ALWAYS shift from 4H to 2H, that’s no problem. But be gentle when first trying to go from 2wd to 4wd on the fly. If the transfer case lever will snap in with no gear clashing, then you have a live front axle and can shift on the fly. If you get gear grinding, forget it, stop before you engage 4wd…
Now if your vehicle has some sort of “automatic locking hubs” you must stop first as the front axle is not “live” until SOMETHING engages the front hubs

My 84 GMC pickup with auto-locking hubs could be switched into 4wd-hi at speeds under 50. I did NOT have to stop to engage 4wd. Did they change something in 91???Exploding transfer cases are just part of the Four Wheel Drive experience…Grab that lever and jam it in there and see what happens! After that thrill, you might like to try driving into a big ol’ mud-hole and lock 'er in Four-Low then crank the steering wheel to full lock, right or left, makes no difference, and pour the coals to her! $2000 worth of axle shafts, hubs and steering knuckles destroyed in seconds! What fun!We do some serious rock crawling  out here in Tucson. Most of mine was with a 71 Wagoneer (yes they did very well). If the situation presented itself that I needed 4 low I would always come to a complete stop when the really rough stuff stopped and then shift to 4h (Dana 20 transfer case)Never felt the need to experement with my equipment when I was in 4low country, you always take the conservative route when dealing with country that requires 4 low, just to far back in to get stuck.
I leave the snow stuff to thoses “other” 4 wheelers.I appreciate replies to my question, but the sarcasm isn’t very helpful. I’m new to this style of 4WD truck and I’m asking an honest question and hoping for useful advice. I have no idea how to take this response.I don’t anticipate using 4-low very often–or ever. I simply want to know when it is safe to engage the 4WD-high when conditions go from dry pavement to snow and ice. Do I have to pull over, stop the car, put it in neutral before I shift? Or can I just shift into 4WD while driving when the conditions change? The manual offers no advice in this regard. I experimented this weekend and found that it seems to shift into 4-hi no problem. It usually takes a few second for the light on the floor to indicate that the front axle is engaged, but it seems to shift in and out no problem. I haven’t tried it at speeds over 30 mph. I do need the 4WD for driving up the mountain on snow and ice.You can engage while moving. Just make sure wheels are nearly dead straight and you are not slipping. If it seems to engage or disengage hard using a slight application of throttle will help.
Usually the safe high speed is around 50MPH or so. Basically if you need 4wd and need to go faster than 50-60MPH then something is wrong.
In my 4wd vehicles I have used (Toyota 4runner, Pickup, Suburban, Subaru) all the 4wd info was usually printed on the backside of the sun visors.I used to own a similar vintage K2500 4x4. You can shift between 2HI and 4HI on the fly. To go into 4LO, you should be stopped.
The advice to have the wheels straight ahead is especially true with this vintage setup. If you crank the wheels to the side and engage 4WD, you can damage the actuator.
There are sources online for OEM Owner’s Manuals if you are interested. I’ve seen them for around $15 and worth every penny IMO.You should be able to go from 2H to 4H when moving.  I’d try a slower speed engagement at first, say 15 to 20 mph and do this on a dirt or gravel road.  You have an older truck and the condition of the transfer case, front diff, and hubs could be questionable.  If everything seems to work OK, then you can try it at higher speeds.  Above 50 it can be too big a jolt to the system if something isn’t right.  I believe you are aware that these older 4WD set ups don’t do well if you leave them in 4WD and drive on dry pavement, just in case I thought I’d mention it.
It would be a good idea to get all the fluids in the trans, transfer case, and both differentials changed.  Fresh fluids will keep things from going snap, crackle, and pop on you.
Exploding transfer cases are just part of the Four Wheel Drive experience.

So you’re saying that GM (actually chryco) purposely designed a system that is suppose to explode. I don’t think so.I have seen vehicles with the freshest fluids known to man go snap,crackle and pop. Fresh fluids are not protection from overstresing your vehicle.
The incidents would be 10 miles from the start line in an off-road race like the Parker 400,really rough stuff, Mint 400 was rather exciting also, 300 cars behind you all hauling a** and you can’t see 10 ft in front of yourself.I have a 2004 GMC automatic with a hump mounted 4x floor shift.  In no way would i shift-on-the -fly at any speed.   Electrically operated shift is O.K.I forgot to mention this: Don’t worry about the sarcasm. It’s half the fun of giving advice and expressing feelings, or the lack of them. My own sympathy meter goes from zero to maximum at any time. Depends which way the wind is blowing.How to Shift From 2 to 4 Wheel Drive on a Chevrolet Truck

Then the logical thing is to replace the vehicle with something she can ride in . What did you have before that she could ride in ?We had a Lincoln MKS Annd it was fine. Made the swap because neede a vehicle that could be towed 4 wheels down behind a Motor HomeI think a rocking motion would be more noticeable in a Motor home than a normal vehicle that 2 dealers could not find anything wrong.What Motorhome rocking? It is the car that rocks when driven Not towed!Doesn’t your motor home rock when towing the Lincoln?
Why haven’t you tied the other ride options for the Lincoln?
The dealerships found nothing wrong because the problem is the driver choosing the wrong ride setting.The motorhome has nothing to do with the rocking. It was rocking before   being towed by the motorhome.  It is set for COMFORT. tried all the others settings.Okay, let’s try this another way.
The Lincoln rocks in sport mode?
Forget about the Lincoln for a second, your motor home does not rock when driven,  handles like a Miata?Rocks in all modes.  Motor home does not rock on good roads.  Handles like Miata.  Very smooth.
My issue is not with the motorhome.  I was asked why I bought the vehicle is because it tows 4 down…has nothing to do with th Motorhome.Well, the only recourse is to trade it in.  Take an extended test drive with your wife prior to purchase of the next vehicle.Rocks? Or wobbles?",,,,
284,2015 Toyota 4Runner - Vibrates when braked,Maintenance/Repairs,5,187,"staring wheel and brake peddle vibrates when brakes are applied at high speedWarped rotors.The good news is those OEM brakes were likely near worn out anyway. And new rotors are part of a modern brake job. Get them changed out.Odds are the brakes need to be redone both front and rear. Steering wheel vibration generally points to the fronts and brake pedal pulsation often means the rear.
Loose steering and suspension components can also mimic a brake problem. This is all assuming that you are not referring to a near panic stop from 80 MPH per the high speed comment.Or, your abs is kicking in at low speeds? But you don’t own a GM, so that’s probably not the issue.

285,2011 Toyota 4Runner - High miles and concerns,Maintenance/Repairs,8,300,"Looking to buy a 2011 4runner limited with 188,000 miles on it. I have driven an '02 4runner with 217,000 miles on it for almost 7 years now and have really loved the reliability. Just unsure about the 5th generation cars- as well as the number of miles on this particular vehicle. Should i be concerned?All depends on how it was maintained and driven.  Any used car is a gamble.
Pay an independent mechanic to inspect it prior to purchase.Any 9 year old vehicle with 188K is a concern. This vehicle could be at the end of its life or have many more miles. It depends on how well it was maintained more than anything else. I hope it is really cheap.Sure, the 2011 4Runner is 9 years newer than yours
But it has nearly as many miles
How about a 2011 4Runner with less than 100K miles . . . ?!
let’s be realistic . . . an extremely large percentage of drivers don’t take very good care of their vehicle, completely skipping on automatic transmission services, for example, to name just one maintenance procedure
That 2011 4Runner with 188K miles could be soon due for an automatic transmission overhaul due to lack of maintenance, for all I know
or it may have been chronically run low on engine oil, due to the attitude many people have adopted, which is to not pop the hood between scheduled servicesSure be concerned.  You never know.  Depends on the quality of its early life and construction.  I had the trans in my Riviera overhauled at 350,000 just because I was driving all over the state and didn’t want a breakdown 400 miles away.  The trans guy said it didn’t really look all that bad.  Finally got rid of it at 520K without the engine ever being opened up.  So you never know.The first question for me is what are they asking for it.
Any used car is a coin flip. A thorough inspection pre-purchase can help swing the odds into your favor but even the most thorough of inspections does not guarantee a problem free ride.I agree with the others. 188,000 miles represents a large potential for the owner to screw the car up. You’ll want to have it looked at by a mechanic before you buy at minimum. but I also agree specifically with @db4690 - you’re getting a newer car in years, but not so much in mileage.
What’s the point? Personally, I’d save up a little more and try to get a car that’s both newer and has fewer miles.You have high miles. You want a newer, lower mile rig. You found a newer rig. Bite the bullet. Pay more for a lower mile rig.

286,"New starter, loud clunk!",Maintenance/Repairs,10,462,"Hey everyone, minivan acting up again. So last starter in fairness was from a junkyard. Did the same thing one morning. Turn key, loud clunk. Bought a brand new Duralast Gold starter, didn’t go cheap. Finished installing, turn key, clunk. Tried jumping, battery appeared low so just brought down to charge under warranty. Top battery 850CCA for the vehicle. While I’m waiting on charge tell me something good! 2000 Ford Windstar SEL 3.8L. I’ve seen flywheel could be a culprit but upon removal of old starter eyeballed flywheel. No major chunks missing off teeth, at least that I could see while up under the car in daylight. Any help is appreciated…Did you try turning the engine over by hand?
TesterNegative, it was running fine before turning off, no overheating, noise, smoke…You turn the motor over by hand to see if it WILL turn over proving the engine is not locked up. Doesn’t matter that it was running fine before.Nevermind, found the problem. It’s a Ford, first and last one I’ll ever buy. My Nissan ran to an easy 400,000. Yeah it moved. If it’s not going to run I’ll just charge for swings down at the local stadium. Trying to stay positive! Ok everyone so far thank you for your suggestions, I mean it!!! P.S. edit! I just recalled that I had to start in neutral with last starter!!! Would a bad TPS be causing this???A bad TPS sensor, or the wiring to it, will not cause the starter to make a loud clunking sound. The sound you are hearing can be caused by a couple of things. One is the engine is locked up and the starter can’t turn it over. Do not force the starter to stay ON if that is the case. You will burn up the battery cable due to high current flow. The second thing that can cause the issue is the main battery cable to the starter has internal corrosion to the wires at the battery due to battery acid leaching into the cable. That causes high resistance and will block the power needed to run the starter motor when the solenoid turns on and connects the motor to the battery. I suspect that is what is happening in your case. The engine is fine and you need to replace the main cable to the starter. Check the main ground cable also. Battery cable issues are a major source of car troubles. Fortunately they are fairly easy to fix and not real expensive on the pocket book. You should normally have at least 10.5 volts at the starter while cranking the engine over if the cable is good.
When you have to put the shift lever into neutral to start the engine it means there is a problem with the safety switch going to the starter solenoid. Putting it in neutral bypasses the safety switch and the car still can’t move forward when it is started.


 Cougar:

Battery cable issues are a major source of car troubles.


It has been 15 years since I had to replace a battery cable on a customers vehicle so it may be very vehicle specific for those that have failing cables.
During the last 25 years the cables have been integrated into the wiring harness. Some manufactures offered an overlay cable that would bypass the original cable but in most cases it is necessary to engineer an overlay cable.When I stated battery cables are a major source of of car troubles I should have been a little more specific. What I was really referring to is battery connection problems, like corroded or loose connections. Internal wire corrosion isn’t real common but as you know, it can happen.Anyone know what the difference is between a neutral safety switch and a transmission position sensor? Had a backup for the meantime, getting to parts but want to make sure I get it right. Thanks for the input so far by the way everyone, really appreciate it!!!A neutral safety switch has different nomenclature besides that NSSW name.  Trans position sensor, range selector switch, etc.
I seem to remember some Ford manuals generally call them range selector switches.
Switches are going to have nothing to do with a clunk sound. If you hit the key and there’s a clunk but the engine is not turning over you need to make sure it will turn over. Mustangman is correct that running fine before may not mean anything. Sometimes they give up the ghost the second the turn is turned off.I assume starter was off car for short time? Hours? I had a car tore apart for several weeks and starter would not crank. Turned out to be corrosion on cables. Cleaned contacts and it cranked fine.",,,,

290,Recall information,Maintenance/Repairs,6,247,"I have a 2010 Cobalt with a fuel leak near the rear drivers side wheel. NHTSA informed GM in July 2020 that they were investigating this problem because they had 208 complaints of this problem at the time the complaint was registered with GM. the fuel leak is from corrosion of the fuel line, which is inches away and offset but above the muffler. No fires reported yet.
My question is whether anyone knows how long these investigations typically take?  I already know that significantly older cars are involved in recent recalls (e.g. Takata air bag igniters). If it isn’t more than a month or two, I’ll hold onto the car. Otherwise, I’ll sell it soon. I know that no one knows how long the process takes, I’m hoping for an educated guess. It took a couple months for the Bolt power plant battery from the investigation start to the recall, and my guess is that if there is a recall, it should be soon. Anyone have an idea?Even if you’re keeping the car for a limited amount of time, a fuel leak is a significant safety hazard.
If you have this repaired by your regular mechanic, and GM later issues a recall, you can be refunded the money that you spent for that repair–even if you no longer own the car–as long as you can provide documentation.
Get it repaired, save the repair invoice, and then decide whether you want to hold onto this car.
If you sell it before it is repaired, you MUST disclose this problem to the buyer.FYI, I had the fuel lines earlier this year on my 2010 Cobalt. My mechanic installed the OEM one piece lines. It was 4 hours of labor for a total cost of $550 to 600. Of course I misplaced the receipt but as it was the first significant repair since I bought the car new I can’t complain too much.
Ed B.Thanks, guys. I know all that already, including the approximate $600 for the work. I’m likely to sell it to CarMax or a similar place. The car is parked, and isn’t moving except to get the repairs should I decide to fix it. I’m still interested in any general information about how recalls progress. I’m inclined to not pay for it if I sell to CarMax. I’ll hold on a while longer.Might as well fix it if it needs fixing and drive on. $600 is small change when looking at a replacement vehicle.Why not just fix it anyway even if you are going to sell it.  That way the next owner won’t see the car and maybe him/herself and kids go up in a ball of fire.  Heck of a way to discover a problem with a leaky fuel line above the exhaust.I’m going to sell it to a dealer like CarMax, not a private party. I feel no obligation to tell them. They undoubtedly will notice it when they park it after the test drive or when they put it on a lift for inspection. Part of the problem is Mrs JT is extremely frugal. She squeezes cash so hard that when she enters the room, all the dead presidents run out screaming. And I have to convince her.",,,,

Catalytic Converters: Why Thieves Steal Them 3
Learn why catalytic converters are stolen and how to protect your car from catalytic converter thieves.





37 cars, $1850 minimum for less than an hours work.Gee what’s going on in Lincoln?  At least the Fixident and beer thefts were not major.  In Minnesota it is illegal to wear a mask in public with some exceptions.  Of course now everyone wears one.  Amazing how many thieves don’t take advantage of that.  I was going into the drug store and a guy I know was coming out with mask and sunglasses.  It took me a while to figure out who it was.  If you’re going to do the crime, at least mask up, and save us some court costs.


 Beancounter:

Who in their right mind would willing risk a year or more in prison for stealing or installing hot parts when you could make so much more and be able to breath “free air” by simply going straight?


The people who steal catalytic converters from cars are like the people who destroy perfectly good air conditioners to steal the copper pipe and coils, and the people who tear up vacant houses to steal copper pipes and wire–they are mostly drug addicts who need the money to buy dope.  Drug addicts don’t think in terms of cost/benefit analysis, risks of getting caught, criminal penalties, etc.  If they aren’t afraid of the negative health consequences of using drugs, and they aren’t afraid of the criminal penalties for being caught with drugs, then they surely aren’t afraid of the potential criminal penalties for trespassing, theft, burglary, etc.



 Beancounter:

And, last I heard “Receiving Stolen Goods” is still a criminal offense and Judges seem to be less inclined to be receptive to the “I thought I was getting a good deal” defense.


The thieves who steal catalytic converters are probably not in the business of selling used auto parts, and certainly aren’t in the business of repairing cars for other people.  These parts are sold as scrap to companies which purchase such items.  I believe that most states require some sort of documentation to sell more than a small quantity of scrap metal (other than beverage cans) in order to deter metal theft.  For example, here in Arizona, when I have taken scrap metal to be redeemed–as part of my employment duties–I was required to be fingerprinted, the scrap dealer kept a photocopy of my ID, and the payment was by check to the company I worked for.  If you are a private individual trying to sell more than a very small quantity of material, payment is by check mailed to your home address after a 30-day waiting period.
People trying to sell stolen car parts, air conditioning coils, copper pipe, or other similar commodities would have to create fake documents in order to get a legitimate scrap dealer to buy their stuff.  The laws, in turn, will protect the scrap dealer as long as they make a reasonable attempt to comply with their obligations.

All of the newer trucks have a higher bed than our old truck, and the gooseneck will sit too high–tilting the trailer and making the underside of the gooseneck periously close to our tailgate.

Alternatively, we would need to replace the axels on our trailer.


 Intrepidfootfollower:

No, The “Automatic Level Rear Air Suspension” is to keep the truck at the correct height.
You will have to modify your trailer, or get a different style tailgate.
The different tailgate won’t do much good when making sharp turns though.Do you have a tandem axle on this trailer I would think with the higher bed that it would not be good for the trailer suspension with the rear axle carrying the most weight not to mention be uncomfortable for the horse’s.


 Intrepidfootfollower:

We are looking at a RAM 2500 with Automatic Level Rear Air Suspension. Will that allow us to lower the truck height and drive with a lower height.


Yes, the alternate towing height mode lowers the rear of the truck 1 inch, that may not be enough for your trailer.



 Intrepidfootfollower:

Alternatively, we would need to replace the axels on our trailer.


Not exactly. My father had four wheel drive trucks with a high deck height, when he purchased a fifth wheel trailer he asked the RV dealer to raise the ride height of the trailer to match the truck. They moved each axle position from above the leaf spring to below the spring, the effect was a 5 to 6 inch higher trailer height. This is not an expensive procedure.",,,,
293,2019 RAM 1500 - Leaking from filter housing,Maintenance/Repairs,5,264,"changed the oil for the first time at 6900 and found it was leaking from the (new oil) filter . Changed the filter again with a stock mopar filter again. It is still leaking oil on my floor. Please any suggestions.The things that might cause this are -  did not replace gasket - put new gasket on with old one still there - did not tighten enough or tightened to much .
Your choice but on a new vehicle I always use the dealer for oil and filter changes until the warranty expires . That way there is a record and no disputes if a problem occurs.Yah my mistake. I have always used the dealer in the past, but this time because of so many dealer issue problems with these guys i didn’t, I did have this shop replace the filter two times with a mopar filter and did ask if there is only one gasket on it and they said yes. I’m not a spring chicken any more but guess i’ll have to use the old rhino lifts i’ve always used in the past and crawl under and look for myself. Maybe try a Mobile 1 ,or Bosch . Doesn’t make sense to me. Thanks for your comments .Unfortunately I had bad experiences with my local Dodge dealership.  When Lee Iacocca headed Chrysler he mentioned that problem.  Seems the franchise owners never got the message.  I would like a Miata, but same owner as Dodge in my area.
I switched to Ford, very pleased with the dealership.Make sure the old gasket is not stuck in place.another common mistake . . .
overtightening the new spin-on filter, which also causes leakage
maybe the guy doing the oil change got the cold shoulder the night before and was overcompensating?",,,,

I saw that the other day. I wonder how, exactly, they expect people to stop the moose. My one vehicular encounter with a moose was on a dark back road at night in Maine. Came around a corner and he was just standing there in the road. I slammed on the brakes and sat there awhile. Moose didn’t move. I honked, hoping to scare him off the road. He just gave me a look that very clearly said “Do that again, bub, and you’ll regret it.”
Finally after about 5 minutes he ambled off into the woods. I think if he’d wanted to lick my car, there wouldn’t be much of anything I could do to prevent it.I’m not sure why I should worry about moose licks. Moose kicks, yes, I’ll worry about that. I mean, I would, if I lived anywhere near moose. In my suburban neighborhood, we just have black bears and copperheads. Oh, and deer. Way too many deer.I went to summer camp in Allegany State Park (yes, that is the correct spelling, no matter what spellcheck and Pennsylvanians say)  Friday nightwe had boxing matched between campers at the far end of the camp from the cabins.
I nuck back to uur cabin to get a Hershey bar and was walking back to the matches eating the bar and looking up at the Milkey Way that was flowing across the night sky like a river when I walked into the side of a huge Black bear that was coming down to browse in the mess hall garbage cans.
We both grunted and took off in different directions.
The next week, that same bear was pawing through the garbage, one of our consolers was on the low roof at the rear of the mess hall and anted a picture of the bear. This was in the 1940s and the camers needed a very bright flash bulb.  He wanted the Bear looking up at him so he whistled and set off the flash in the bears eyes.  The bear made one swipe at his arm and we could see the white of the bone in his arm before the blood blossomed.
he wrapped his arm in towels and threw him in the back of the camp station wagon and took him to the nearest hospital.  We never heard about how he was doing.


 jtsanders:

Way too many deer.


Deer are the (larger than insect, non-human) animals that cause the most fatalities, most through collisions with car.  My alumni magazine reported a fatality of a guy on a bicycle who collided with one.  Some have speculated that re-introducing wolves would result in fewer total human fatalities (but vastly increased deer casualties).



 oldtimer_11:

Allegany State Park (yes, that is the correct spelling, no matter what spellcheck and Pennsylvanians say)


It started out as a Native word, not spelt in any language.  It’s unsurprising there is more than 1 spelling in English.  I used to live out that way.  We spelt the airline ‘All agony’.



 oldtimer_11:

I never ran into one, but all my encounters ended up with the bear running away as fast as he could, even one chowing down on a cow corpse.  Don’t expect a brown bear to be so shy.No, If I went to camp where there were grizzly bears I would have likely not survived such a an encounter.
Black bears are usually dangerous if the spend too much time around people which is why the parks no longer have dumps where people can circle their cars and hand feed bears candy and honey like they did when I was a child.
Has anyone ever heard of corduroy roads?  During the  depression the CCC built many structures in the park and “improved” the dirt roads by splitting logs and burying them in the dirt to give a flat surface to drive on.  This worked about as well as you would expect in a place that gets a lot of rain and snow and most of the logs wound up in their most stable position, which was flat side down.  Then they were blacktopped over giving a surface much like driving across the wales of corduroy.


 RandomTroll:

Not in most areas of the Northeast. There is not enough unpopulated space to support wolves without significant human interaction. Whenever coyotes move into an area, outdoor pets tend to disappear, and they are solitary animals. A pack of wolves is an entirely different matter. They are very efficient at thinning any herd they come in contact with.after reading the title the first time, I instinctively went back and reread it in a Russian accent…  “Do not let moose lick car”
 


 shadowfax:

I saw that the other day. I wonder how, exactly, they expect people to stop the moose.


I mean, I guess you could say please, doubt the moose would care, though!
Moose are not afraid of people and they are a very dangerous animal that could easily kill you. My closest encounter with a Moose scared the crap out of me. I was fertilizing my lawn after work one day just before dusk. I’m going back and forth across lawn. On one pass I turn around and right behind me is a Moose. I froze as he just walked pass to the graze on the flowers of one of my apple trees. That is one big animal. At first I thought it was a horse. I’m 6’3 and it was several inches taller then me.Moose rut is the most dangerous time, although anything that large is always dangerous. I understand that male moose are nuts with hormones and will attack most anything.  The article I read said the first two weeks of October.I grew up in Duluth MN in the 50’s. It seemed the favorite moose pictures in the news were ones with the antlers caught in a clothesline dragging clothes behind them.Any housewives chase the moose with a broom to get their clothes back?[quote=""jtsanders,
Any housewives chase the moose with a broom to get their clothes back?
I can see it now with the moose laughing all the way.Actually, that’s a serious question. My brother-in-law used to live in Coastal South Carolina. There was a woman in a suburban development that was in the front yard sweeping the sidewalk. She noticed a rather large alligator on the driveway, and tried to shoo it away by swatting it on the snout with her broom. The gator backed into the garage until it wedged under the back of her car. Then it got mad, stood up, lifting the back end of the car off the ground, and let out a big roar.  She decided it was time to get help. I believe that animal control was able to get the alligator out and back to the river safely without any humans getting hurt. People do strange things sometimes.I have lived in Florida for quite a few year’s and have seen and heard of many people doing strange and really stupid things around gator’s it is a wonder more people don’t get killed by gator’s.One trip went through Alligator alley in FL., did not see any alligators, decided to feed the sea gulls some crackers, that was a mistake, those birds were crazy.I thinkI lived here about six months beforeI saw a wild gator (now I’m dating one…lol),  but that was 1977.  Lots more around now, same with manatees.  Yep, never feed gulls or grackles.

If there are more alligators that means there is more food. More likely, land that used to be just for wildlife is now inhabited by people too.",,,,

 pmarc:

Have not brought car back to the guy who did the mod.


That’s what you need to do. There is NO way for us to know what the modder did to the original car and these kinds of issues are hard enough to diagnose on an un-modified car. I’d also say the modder disabled your check engine light as all 3 of those codes would throw a check engine every time it sees them. The last 2 because there is no cat.
That said, the EPC light comes on when there is a:

Throttle body failure
Bad ABS Sensor
Failed brake pedal switch – Common problem on Golf 4 & Fabia
Bad ABS Ring
Bad ABS sensor wiring
A failed brake pressure sensor (Inside the ABS Module)
A Bad Engine Sensor
Internal engine problem
Power steering failure
Steering wheel sensor
Wiring issues
And can toss you into Limp Home mode.

The Audi mechanic knows this and likely has looked for these things.Thanx. Will do. But how can something go wrong only one second every 2,000 miles?Intermittent open/short.If this is a road car, I’d put the cat and O2 sensors back on, you’re gaining minimal hp without it, and are a major polluter.


 pmarc:

But how can something go wrong only one second every 2,000 miles?


@texas has the correct answer



 texases:

Intermittent open/short


Especially likely on a 19 year old car with modifications. Sensors fail, the car is trying to protect itself from damage. It might also be an error cause by the mods that didn’t appear until now once the car was a bit more worn. Audi plans for that. Your modder doesn’t.
Also, agree with this advice, too, as it is illegal (federal law) whether you have inspections or not in your state.



 texases:

 pmarc:

Cat converter removed.


As long as this is the case, I won’t be trying to help.Except that doesnt guarantee a solution.
The modder is giving me details… which I’ll post here. In the end he is cooperating.Here’s mod details:
-Apr stage 1 ecu flash
-Plus removal of cat and addition of these hardware components: exhaust, intercooler, intake, and test pipe.They had to do something with the O2 sensor.  Plenty of cars make great hp with cats. Removing them is a TERRIBLE IDEA.With an old vehicle like this I would look for an intermittent problem with the throttle position sensor or the accelerator position sensor, these failures can be difficult to capture with the scan tool.
I think that the modifications have nothing to do with the malfunction.Some ppl say mod isnt affecting it. They have mentioned the throttle body and poss the airmass sensor.I sent my problem and engine codes to APR, the software company … we installed their product. Googling the APR product you can see other ppl have had the same problem. Let you know…Altho more research didn’t reveal much, the car started idling poorly and got worse. Took it in and one O2 sensor is dead and two manifold intake  hoses are very loose.",,,,

Took it to an auto repair shop they did the diagnostics to find out that this problem could be repaired only at a Nissan service center. I am taking it on Monday and will do the transmission service as well.Why read about issues after you buy it? Why not research it before you buy it? What service do you have to do in order for warranty to cover any trans issues? Are you confident warranty will fix issues? That’s if you have trans issues? If you “return” it, can you get refund on warranty?Did my research thoroughly. Historically, surveyed at all the models of the pathfinder and 2014 did not have maximum problems. Wanted an affordable large family car and this fitted the needs perfectly. CVT was introduced in 2013 and hence had a lot of problems. The carI have  has no recalls as suggested by VIN check.

AlexDon’t, just don’t. This is a bad idea.
Any aftermarket product will be less effective, less reliable, less durable and potentially more unsafe than the manufacturers internal systems.
If you want these features, buy a new vehicle.I’ve found some reviews but for many of these they can be finicky depending on how well they were installed. I have eyesight of n my 2015 and haven’t needed anything else. The added features of the 2020 are tempting.Just stick with the old fashioned way, look over your shoulder and if needed get some additional little mirrors to stick on. I like the rectangular ones.

Many of our fleet vehicles have them, and they help a great deal in diminishing the size of the blind spotI’ve found that by setting my outside rear view mirrors correctly, I don’t have blind spots. It doesn’t work for all vehicles, but it works on two Honda Accords I’ve owned. The method is also recommended by AAA as I recall. If you like, I’ll describe it.
What do these sensors cost including installation?Some kits are $600 or more plus installation. I’ve followed the same method with my 2015 Forester and adjusting the mirrors does help considerably.
One source for reviews, the top rated one is about $600 on Amazon

Best Blind Spot Detection Systems: Get a Little Help Watching the Road 5
Looking for a blind spot detection system? Our team of experts narrowed down the best blind spot detection systems on the market. Read this review and save yourself time and money.





I agree that the protections in a new vehicle are better than those provided by aftermarket add-ons, Mustang.
In the industry I worked (computer industry) we had a saying
“Better is the enemy of Good.”
Point being that by waiting around ;until I can afford the higher cost for upgrading to a new vehicle for the “better” factory installed versions of these detectors (which you are likely correct are better) I’m denying myself and my wife the not-as-good but still worthwhile benefits of the aftermarket detectors.
Just buy a new car is a no-brainer for folks for whom money/budget is not a relevant factor. That doesn’t, sad to say, apply to me. You will be disappointed with the aftermarket stuff.
I come from the automotive industry where “just good enough” is a siren song for lawyers. Accident avoidance systems not only must not do harm, they must work as well.
The aftermarket does not have the knowledge of the cars command and control systems like the OEMs do. Nor do they rigorously test these add ons on every car to any degree. And if lawyers come knocking, they go out of business to avoid a settlement.I agree fish eyes are under-rated and inexpensive. I already have them on both my cars. I am a great fan of them.
They do not completely eliminate the blind spots, but help greatly.
What’s more important is, unlike the electronic warning systems, they ONLY help if you continuously monitor them. They won’t alert you when someone enters your blind spots while you are busy watching what’s directly ahead or whatever.
They won’t alert you if you are drifting close to crossing the shoulder borderline or the next lane divider.
The electronic systems PROACTIVELY alert you to that and other potential hazards.
They are like having two or three dedicated traffic observers riding with you… ones who never get distracted or forget what their job is. 
These system have been out there long enough that even in the few short years the statistics are clear that they reduce accidents.

I fly an aircraft.

It has not be thoroughly tested in my aircraft, and historically even the factory installed ones work successfully most, but not all, of the time.
I prefer to fly with it in the plane rather than remove it because it’s imperfect.
I rather suspect that if I was taking you up for a flight you might consider it to have some value after I explained it to you and told you how and when to deploy it if I dropped dead at the controls.  Some imperfect additional protection is better than none. Particularly if you understand its limitations and are not counting on it to be 100% effective.
As you can see by some reviews of folks who have purchased some of these, despite their warts, some are happy with them.
I’m fishing for feedback with folks with actual experience with particular aftermarket kits… And grateful some here have supplied a little of that.

Not really the same concept. First, as long as its capable of supporting the plane’s weight and you get it roughly in the right area, it’s probably going to work as intended because, after all, it’s just a firework that launches a sheet that fills with air.
Also, it’s something you use when things have already gone wrong. It’s not generally something that will cause things to go wrong, as blind spot monitors can.
The people that are happy with them haven’t experienced a failure (yet). But if you come to rely on the BSM, and for whatever reason it fails to light when someone is in your blind spot, that’s a problem. That doesn’t mean all aftermarket BSM systems are dangerous and should be avoided, but it does mean that you need to go a lot deeper than asking some anonymous people on a car forum.

Hi!
The aircraft I co-own and fly is in the FAA certification class Experimental. (It’s not quite what that sounds like to folks outside the aviation community. Most are well proven aircraft.  Tried to look up total numbers registered but was unable to… I’d wild guess it’s well over 10,000 flying and have been at that level for half a century.
A key feature of… widely viewed as an advantage by owners of aircraft classified Experimental… is that parts do NOT have to be FAA certified. This results in, for example, us owners of Experimentals getting identical aircraft quality tires at sometimes 1/3rd of the price. We also have access and can readily upgrade to the very latest and greatest GPS navigation devices years ahead of the pilots with aircraft that have standard (not Experimental) certification without waiting years for the FAA to approve them and without going though complex and expensive applications for approval to replace our older avionics… Again at far lower cost. Eventually, the FAA catches up with the reality and the components that the Experimental aircraft are running appear as FAA certified versions. You might in a way say the Experimental aircraft community members are the beta testers for the rest of aviation.
My ballistics parachute may or may not have been an FAA certified product, but it  was not and didn’t have to be approved to install in my aircraft. Like both an OEM and aftermarket lane and proximity detector on a car, there is no guarantee that it will work as expected/hoped when your life depends on it. But I’m still glad it’s in the plane… and I imagine if you were foolish enough to go for a flight with me  you’d rather have it in the plane than not. Not so?",,,,

301,"2009 Chevy Aveo - Battery dies overnight, but there’s a twist",Maintenance/Repairs,57,23.3k,"Hello!
I have a 2009 Chevy Aveo which has had an ongoing problem for months. Every night the battery completely dies. The first thing I did was replace the battery with a brand new one (and, later, replaced that one too - hey, you can never be too careful) but it kept happening. Two mechanics have told me that the alternator seems to be working fine and is definitely charging the car while it runs, and that there’s got to be a draw on the battery when the car is off.
But here’s the weird part. When they test the battery for a load with a voltimeter/ampmeter/whatever, there’s no unusual draw at all. Obviously there has to be a draw sometime, because the thing is at 12.6V when I go to sleep and 4.0V in the morning. I know this because I had to buy a big stand-up battery charger that I use every day. 
The conclusion the mechanics have come to is that something is “turning on” after the car has been off for some time, and draining a lot of power. How can I find this? What could it be? Help me, Car Talk Community, you’re my only hope!Does this car have a remote starter system (either a “factory” system or an aftermarket system) installed?
I have seen instances where malfunctioning remote start systems did some very weird things when the car was sitting idle, and these strange electrical events could be draining the OP’s battery.
If there is a remote start system, I would suggest that the OP have it disconnected.Ah, I should have mentioned that, because the mechanics asked me, too. No, this is a completely stock 2009 Chevy Aveo with no aftermarket mods except a block heater (I live in North Dakota).Did you buy this as a new car, or did you buy it as a used car?
I ask because buyers of used cars are sometimes not fully aware of the equipment on their car.Until the problem is tracked down it will be less stressful on the battery if you disconnect the negative terminal each night.
There could be a problem with the EVAP system, which runs after the car is off a few hours.“There could be a problem with the EVAP system, which runs after the car is off a few hours.”

+1
Yes, that is another possibility.
The EVAP system should run for only a couple of minutes when the car is idle, but if it is malfunctioning, it is very possible that it could be running long enough to drain the battery.You could start pulling different fuses each night to see if you can find the responsible circuit.I’m wondering if you have any specifics on “no unusual draw at all.”  Do you know what level of draw was actually observed?
Personally, I guess I’d be thinking about a “stakeout” - hook up a meter at the end of the day, leave it on, and keep babysitting it until something happened.  This isn’t really practical for a shop to do.  I’m sure some clever work with a webcam or something and you could babysit the meter from your couch.I ask because buyers of used cars are sometimes not fully aware of the equipment on their car.

That’s a good point. I only assume I don’t have one because the seller never mentioned it, there’s no fob on the keys it came with, and it’s the base model of the Aveo. And the mechanics I took it to didn’t say anything abuot a remote starter. Is it possible I have one tucked away, maybe?
Until the problem is tracked down it will be less stressful on the battery if you disconnect the negative terminal each night.

My coworker suggested buying a knife terminal switch and just using that, since I’ve been wrestling with this problem for so long. My understanding is that does the same thing a little easier. Am I right?
There could be a problem with the EVAP system, which runs after the car is off a few hours.

This sounds very promising! How would I find out it’s the EVAP and not some other random thing, like the rear defroster (also suggested as a possible random switch-on by mechanic)?
I'm wondering if you have any specifics on ""no unusual draw at all."" Do you know what level of draw was actually observed?

They didn’t give me any numbers, but of the two mechanics who specifically checked the load, they both said the car should be fine for “months” without losing charge. I’m not sure how many milliamps that implies.
Thanks a lot for your help thus far, guys! I think I am going to try that webcam stakeout thing. I just hope my laptop doesn’t freeze solid in this godawful ND winter. I agree with @cigroller‌
For me, a car is good if it’s got less than 50 milliamps of parastic draw.  That is not perfect, but acceptable.
Some of my colleagues consider several hundred milliamps of parasitic draw to be acceptableThere could be a module/computer that fails to go to sleep after the vehicle is shut off. Or a module/computer that wakes backup after the vehicle is shut off. These are called F.R.E.D.'s
You can’t use the old method to check for a parasitic current draw because disconnecting the battery forces the offending component to go to sleep. So when you go to check for the parasitic current draw it’s not there.
You have to sneak up the current draw to catch it. Here’s how that’s done.
http://www.diagnosticnews.com/parasitic-battery-drains/ 355
TesterHere we go again . . .
I’m pretty sure this vehicle uses a top post battery
I’m able to successfully hook up my Fluke, set up to measure parasitic draw,  WITHOUT breaking the connection, so to speak
It’s not rocket science.  You just have to be very careful.I had a fan controller do this on my car and didn’t figure it out until I was walking by the car 3 hours after it had been shut off and heard the radiator fans start up.I have to wonder if the shop checked to see if the trouble is being caused by the alternator backfeeding current due to a bad blocking diode inside the alternator. They may have overlooked that in their testing.
I agree with @db4690 that normal current draw should be less than 50 milliamps. More like 25 would be prefered. Aftermarket accessories can make the reading go higher if there are some installed on the vehicle.It sounds like something is happening during that night that draws a lot of current.  Presumably the tech is observing nothing beyond 50 ma of parasitic drain initially.  The comes back in the morning and finds the battery drained.  A car battery has a capacity of about 30 Amp-Hours, which means it would take 30,000/50 = 600 hours or 25 days to drain the battery at a 50 mA  rate.   So something big must be happening at some point during the night.
hmmm … electronics types with access to professional equipment would put a instrument on the battery lead to monitor and log the current drain vs time.   Then you’d know how many hours it took before whatever is happening, happens.     While the typical shop wouldn’t have this kind of equipment, I think a mechanic who specialized in auto-electrical diagnosis would at least have an instrument that would measure the peak current flow occurring during the night.  That would provide a big clue as to what is happening.
It has to be something turning on that produces a lot of current drain, like the starter motor engaging, the headlights coming on, or the alternator shorting out.  I think you just need to phone around to find an auto-electric shop that has the proper equipment to log the parasitic current vs time is all.  Then you’ll know when it happens, and can be there the next night to see what exactly is going on.
I guess if I had this problem myself I might see if I rig a way, using a relay or a thermostat or something, to turn a loud radio on when the current drain exceeds 1 amp.
BTW, this situation could well present a fire hazard.  OP may want to avoid parking in a garage until it is resolved.Um, if the battery is regularly dropping down to 4 volts, if it wasn’t bad before, it is now. Nor do I see any mention that the battery was load tested.Something just occurred to me . . .
My Fluke 88 can be set up to record minimum and maximum values
Here’s what I would do, to confirm that something is waking up during the night
Hook up the Fluke to measure current draw . . . you can CAREFULLY hook up the fluke WITHOUT breaking the connection, so to speak
Make sure all the doors are closed, and the car is locked
When everything is stabilized at 50 milliamps, for example, set up the fluke to record
In the morning, see what happened . . . check out the min/max values
If something woke up, the max value should reflect it
Even though you won’t know what woke up, you’ll have confirmed your suspicion""Nor do I see any mention that the battery was load tested. ""
This was in the original post:
""The first thing I did was replace the battery with a brand new one (and, later, replaced that one too - hey, you can never be too careful) but it kept happening. ""
I guess all three batteries could have been bad including the two new ones.  Implausible.  Though you’re right that each one, including the one in there now has been abused.Though you’re right that each one, including the one in there now has been abused. 
Yeah, that’s what I was getting at. Of course, that’s not the origin of the problem, just an additional one the OP will probably have to deal with.I know this post is a little old, but I’ve been having the same issue with my 2009 Aveo for about 2 years now, and I bought it brand new, base model as well.
Chevy wouldn’t acknowledge any problem once I replaced the first dead battery with a non-chevy brand battery, and I’ve not had the money nor energy to put into figuring out what’s the issue. So I go and get my still under warranty, only a couple weeks (or sometimes days) old battery replaced all the time. I’ve probably replaced it 18 times in the last two years.
I’m not as auto aware as some might be, but the issue sounds the same… battery dies, its not the alternator, and nothing appears to be putting a drain on the battery, although something clearly is.
Sometimes the replacement battery will last a few months before dying over night, other times it will only go about a week before I have to replace it again. It will always jump, but drains progressively more quickly the longer I wait to replace it. Sometimes its less than 4 hours before its drained again, other times it takes over 12. I’ve seen a ton of forums on the issue for the 09 aveo, but never have seen one where someone has figured it out.

Dealer/Toyota denied warranty coverage because of “water intrusion.”
The insurance estimator inspected the HL yesterday and reported to us that there may be a bent rod but no evidence of water intrusion (air box and air filter were dry, no milky oil). He has reached out to the dealer for an explanation of why they concluded there was water intrusion and denied warranty coverage.

Side note: When we purchased the HL, the front and rear tires were mismatched (not permitted by CPO requirements) and the CPO checklist indicated that features our HL does not have passed inspection.

Most CPO used cars are sold without a very thorough inspection, or, in other words, people pay extra for CPO vehicles that may have flaws.

No Kidding !  I wonder just how many of these so called CPO inspections are done from the local donut shop.

I would be really fascinated to hear how such a thing can even be diagnosed on an engine which apparently still runs well enough to drive at normal speeds without making excessive noise.  IF there is a bent connecting rod, it must be bent so little that the engine still runs (mostly) fine, which means that even if the mechanic removed the oil pan and looked up with a flashlight, it would not be obvious.
Also, assuming that water somehow got into the cylinder(s), it would have ended up in the oil pan.  Clean water would not turn the oil milky, but it would still collect there.Thanks. I have spoken with Toyota, and they said they won’t get involved in issues we have with the dealer.


 Brent89:

Thanks. I have spoken with Toyota, and they said they won’t get involved in issues we have with the dealer.


Then take it to a different dealer for a different diagnosis.I cannot imagine a car running well with a bent rod.  What evidence is there of water intrusion?
I’d take it to another dealer, say nothing about the prior diagnosis.
What code set the check engine light?If this Highlander was purchased on the Toyota CPO program, then it is not just a dealer problem. The time  between purchase and the problem is so short that it is almost impossible to have occurred when you owned it. take the list of Toyota CPO checks and have a mechanic you trust check the SUV against the list. This will likely cost you around $100, but that’s a lot less than any fix involving a bent rod. Get everything in writing from anyone involved. Certainly have the Highlander checked by a different dealer.
BTW, what were the codes form the CEL?  We don’t know those yet.


 bcohen2010:

Clean water would not turn the oil milky, but it would still collect there.


Water In The Oil!
TesterThe dealer has thus failed to provide the codes despite our demand, and Toyota refuses to provide all the diagnostics because they’re “proprietary.”
Also, we’ll definitely take it to another dealer, but I believe any subsequent dealer will see the previous dealer’s diagnostics and Toyota’s warranty denial.Yes, they will see past visit data. You could take it to a chain auto parts store and get the codes read. If there are any, take a photo of the code reader screen with your phone or get a printout. The dealer may have erased the codes, and you might have to wait for them to show up again.The code is most likely a misfire code for the cylinder with the bent rod.
TesterJust to clarify, is the CPO actually part of the Toyota CPO program or is some kind of 3rd party warranty that the dealer is passing off as a Toyota CPO?
I ask this because you refer to an insurance estimator.
I have no idea how a bent rod was diagnosed by this person but I would think that with a bent rod there would be a compression variance which could lead to a slight stumble at idle and.or a subtle vibration.
You might consider having someone connect a vacuum gauge to the engine and see if something shows up. This is cheap and easy. I would think that a compression variance would show up on that gauge. An ideal reading is 20 to 21"" of mercury at idle with a rock steady gauge needle.
I’ve often said that CPO designation may or may not mean anything and should be taken with a grain, or wheelbarrow full of salt. At one dealer where I worked CPO inspections (?) were done by the 2 guys in detail who washed cars.It is the Toyota CPO program. The vehicle is still actually under the factory warranty.
My reference to insurance is related to our comprehensive coverage. If there really were water damage it would be a comprehensive claim.Unless they can prove water intrusion I do not see how they can deny a claim. I also do not understand how an insurance estimator can diagnose a bent rod without having some mechanical expertise and going into the engine to some degree.
I would strongly suggest having someone check the engine with a vacuum gauge. This should be a 10 minute deal at most. Another way of checking for a bent rod would be to remove the spark plugs and measure the connecting rod strokes (on top of the piston) with a dial indicator. If one rod is bent that makes it a bit shorter than the others and that would show up on a dial indicator.
I wonder if by some chance your insurance estimator is wrong about a bent rod?
Other than water intrusion the only other thing which could cause a bent rod is something falling into a cylinder such as a nut, small bolt, or part of a spark plug. Even that is grasping on a 2019.
And they will not tell you what diagnostic codes are present seems disingenuous considering what is going on with this vehicle. If you find someone to check things with a vacuum gauge you might ask them to do a scan for DTCs. Just in case someone at some level in the chain is lying.


 Brent89:

Side note: When we purchased the HL, the front and rear tires were mismatched (not permitted by CPO requirements) and the CPO checklist indicated that features our HL does not have passed inspection.


That’s a strong indication your particular vehicle should not have become a genuine Toyota CPO in the first place.
I’ve seen things get ugly and corporate buy back vehicles and remove the CPO status
That’s something I would consider
I wouldn’t be happy driving a vehicle that didn’t meet the criteria for CPO, even though I paid for it.    And the fact that things your vehicle doesn’t even have were checked off as okay means it almost certainly received a sub-standard inspection.  Makes me wonder what else they missed or turned a blind eye to
I’m going to be extremely blunt . . . as far as that CPO inspection goes, your Highlander was pencil whipped
Sounds like the dealer is trying to weasel out of their obligations by using that “bent rod due to water intrusion” excuse
I would consider ramping up the pressure . . . keeping extremely good records, noting down names, times and what was discussedHmmm.  Maybe they’re right and it was a flood vehicle the dealer got at a bargain price?  The plot thickens.Just to clarify, the insurance estimator did a “top dead center” measurement which showed one cylinder “a little lower” which “could” indicate a bent rod, but he said that type of measurement is not “super scientific” and more would have to be done to be conclusive. And, if I didn’t say it before, he found the compression equal and to specs on all cylinders.Still don’t understand the ‘insurance estimator’,  who seems to be doing mechanic type work.  Do they work for this dealer?He works for Progressive insurance company and is assessing whether our comprehensive claim is factually supported. That is, he has to verify  whether what the dealer claims - that water intruded through the air intake system and caused internal damage, this is an “outside influence”  - before Progressive will pay the comprehensive claim. Frankly, he seems much more knowledgeable and credible than the dealer.",,,,

I rented a CVT equipped Corolla a couple of years ago, I don’t remember what year it was but it was close to a 2017 if not that exact year. Anyway, I liked the car. I own a 2009 and it felt very familiar. Corollas are generally reliable but the determining factor is always how the car was maintained.Go here for that info:

2017 Toyota Corolla problems 3
The 2017 Toyota Corolla has 202 problems & defects reported by Corolla owners. The worst complaints are engine, suspension, and transmission problems.





Doesn’t look like too many but the car’s only 3 years old.I have a 2015 Corolla with CVT.  The ‘shifting’ is different from a traditional transmission but easy to get used to.  A non mechanical person won’t even notice.
I have 68k miles with out a problem.  The car has been super reliable, only oil changes brakes and tires.  I would have no hesitation buying another Corolla.  Before you buy yours, have a mechanic check it out, best ~$100 you will spend.
I do have a problem with the rear window defogger not working but I suspect a broken wire somewhere, have not had time to track that down yet.Toyota and Honda makes one of best CVT transmission on the market.

305,E-brake won’t stay up,Maintenance/Repairs,7,228,"I just bought a mazdaspeed3 2008 and every time i pull up on the e brake, it just goes back down. it doesn’t stay up at allPay careful attention to the symptoms. If you pull up on the handle and it feels normal, that is a different symptom than if you pull up and it feels abnormal.
If it feels normal, try to pull up on the handle slowly without pushing the release button.  You should hear a click-click sound of a ratchet mechanism. The mechanism should hold at any position, until the button is pushed.
Without further info, I am guessing that the ratchet mechanism is not functioning. It might be solved by taking the handle out and lubrication, or it might be a broken ratchet. Used ones are on eBay at $30.
Very dangerous: get it fixed!Yeah i think its the ratchet mechanism, because when i pull up you can hear clicking but it doesn’t holdIt could be worn ratchet teeth, or simply dirt that keeps the ratchet from engaging.  Does the button seem to have a limited range of motion…specifically, does it come all the way out?Please perform this test in a remote parking lot
drive slowly
now pull up on the e-brake handle and keep holding it
Is the car slowing down at all?
If yes, the parking brake shoes and cable(s) are most likely just fine, and you just need the e-brake handle assembly . . . or maybe just lubrication, like the other guys already suggestedThe button comes all the way out, but i think the teeth are worn because i pull the ebrake and it catches for a second but then starts to slowly go down and if i pull it up and hold it there for a second it stays then goes back downDo have a link for the ratchet mechanism? I searched for it but can’t find itI just searched on 2008 Mazda3 emergency brake handle and got a number of ebay hits, plus new units.",,,,

So we had it scanned and it needed plugs. No biggy we bought them and it was fine for a couple days to a week. THen happened again. We brought it to the mechanic this time they didn’t find anything wrong other than the plugs again. So we spent a ton of cash to have them replace them with dealer parts. That did not work so we got new coils. Bang it worked for a couple weeks. Now today the lights are on and she is sluggish again. I really need help. Mechanics have been charging a ton of cash to look at it and then to replace the plugs that don’t last long. Anyone have any ideas on what we are missing?


 DarleneKozak:

Anyone have any ideas on what we are missing?


You are missing competent mechanics. Yours seem to be throwing parts at it hoping to fix the problem. You need better mechanics.
What, exactly was the code set?  In the form Pxxxx please.fuel pressure test
injector balance test
use the noid lite kit to make sure all the injectors are being pulsed correctly
compression test
cylinder leakdown test
ask your mechanic if he’s done any of those tests



 DarleneKozak:

we had it scanned and it needed plugs.


No such thing
There’s no fault code that says “You need to replace the spark plugs”
A good mechanic knows the fault code is merely a starting point.
By the way . . . you said “the lights are on and she is sluggish again.”
Okay, fine, the check engine light is on again
But do you have the same exact codes . . . misfire codes of some sort, I presume . . . ?!
Or have you not yet brought the car to a/the shop?Po300-Random misfire
Po302-Cylinder 2 misfire
Po303-Cylinder 3 misfire
Po304-Cylinder 4 misfire

Without running the tests @db4690 listed, it is just a guess from us or your mechanic.
Seems like the 31-2 (actually an OBD code P1676) is a problem with the ABS/TCS and is diagnosed per this link:

All this reinforces my earlier post… You need better mechanics! Might be worth taking it to the dealer.Been to the dealership. Had it scanned when they did my recall. They did not find anything.

309,Strange start and then die problem,Maintenance/Repairs,25,713,"Hi everyone,
This is a 2010 Honda Odyssey 65K.
It has been running well until now. After not using it for many days because of the covid-19, I tried to start it. It cranked, started, and died after a few seconds, and the battery icon lighted up at the dashboard.  When starting, the RPM did go up. Here is the video link: 2010 Honda Odyssey start and die 4
I have tried the followings:

Put in a new battery. No change.
Replaced the ignition switch. No change.
Cleaned the Mass Air Flow sensor which looks OK to me but I had no experience. No change.
Replaced the fuel pump relay. No change.
Cleaned the throttle body valve. Still start and die. However, before cleaning, when I started the car, the RPM will go up and then down. But after cleaning, when I tried to start, I did observe that the RPM sometimes go up and down and go up again and then die, and sometimes RPM won’t have the second “up”. Not 100% sure though if it does the second up ever before I cleaned the throttle body.

The battery measured 12.4 v when off and 14.5 v when starting.
I also tried to press the gas when starting, the RPM will shoot up but it will still die after a few seconds. Here is the video where I tried twice to start the car. The first time at 0 to 0:14, you can see the RPM has the second “up”, and the second time (0:16-0:24), I simultaneously pressed down the gas paddle and the RPM shoot up and then come down.
Tried to start the car after cleaning the throttle body and pressing down the gas paddle 2
I don’t know what to do next. Please advise. Thank you all!


 Solved by Mustangman in post #22 


                Afr of 29 is too lean to keep the engine running. 10 is too rich. When you unplug the maf, the engine defaults to an estimation of the maf signal that isn’t there. Seems like the maf is bad and should be replaced.
              
You posted a lot of things you’ve changed but not how you determined they needed changing. If you just guessed that was the problem, you’ve likely spent a lot of money to replace perfectly good parts. That money could have been used to buy diagnostic tools or pay a mechanic to diagnose the actual problem.
Here’s where I would have started in the first place and where I’d start now as well.
Scan the OBD2 port for error codes, yes, I see no check engine light on but start there anyway. The OBD device should read real-time data so I’d look at oil pressure - either a real reading or an OK, not OK switch and fuel pressure. to start. The engine may have a fail-safe that if no oil pressure is seen, the engine won’t stay running. The fuel pressure should also drop if that is the case. I’d also look at the commanded throttle coming from the ECU.
Do that and report back. Or find a good independent auto repair shop that can fix the van.It seems to me there is a problem with the fuel when the engine is trying to idle. Did you try holding the throttle down about one third of the way to see if the engine would keep running? If the engine will keep running when you keep the throttle pressed down then see if there is a cold start valve. You may need to inspect it and clean it.Thank you Mustangman,
I did scan for error code. But got nothing. Speficially, I added “Fuel Pressure” display but it said “no data” (I don’t understand why.) I have recorded the app screen here: ODB Torque(Lite) screen recording when try to start
There was a pending code P050a.Thank you Cougar. I have just tried holding the throttle down about 1/3 per your suggestion. Nothing changed. Still started and then died.The pending code P050A  indicates a cold start idle air control  system performance issue.


OBD-Codes.com 1



P050A Cold Start Idle Air Control System Performance 1
How to easily diagnose, repair, and info on causes of a P050A trouble code that indicates a detected cold start idle air control system performance problem.





Since the engine doesn’t have an IAC valve, and you’ve cleaned the electronic throttle body, the problem might be with engine coolant temp sensor for the computer.
TesterYou don’t get a fuel pressure reading because there isn’t one. Some engines have them many do not… so No Data.
I’d check to make sure the throttle body actually moves when you press the pedal and make sure there are no cracks or tears in the intake tube between the MAF and throttle body. If nothing shows, then I’d agree with Tester that the coolant temp sensor may be bad. That you should have access to in Torque. See if its reading makes any sense.The fuel pump might be turning off. Check a circuit diagram: on some cars if the oil pressure sensor does not detect oil pressure, the circuit to the fuel pump is interrupted.Something seems to be shutting down either the fuel system or the ignition system for whatever reason. Perhaps the security system is getting activated somehow. If there is an oil pressure shutdown circuit that should be checked also, like @Mustangman suggested .Thank you Tester. I have just read the coolant temperature with the scanner. It reads 6C which was about right as the current ambient temperature is 38F. The reading did not change as I tried to start.
I cleaned the throttle body with the throttle body cleaner spray and paper tower by hand. I didn’t take out the throttle body to clean though.
Any further advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you very much.Hi Mustangman,
Thank you for your advice. How would I check if the throttle body actually moves? There is no visible crack or tears in the intake tube. I just used Torque to read the coolant temp and it showed 6C (about right with the current outdoor temp).
Any further advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you guys so much.Hi shanonia,
Thank you for your advice. Could you be a little specific on how I should check if the fuel pump is turned off? I am new to diagnose by myself. Your help is greatly appreciated!Hi Cougar,
Thank you for your advice. Could you be a little specific on how I should check if the security system is activated? I am new to diagnose by myself. Your help is greatly appreciated!
Thank you to all your guys!


 binchen.bin_171982:

how I should check if the fuel pump is turned off?


I’m no pro, but I would analyze the circuit diagram and see where I could run a wire from the battery to the fuel pump, so the pump runs whenever that  connection is made.Pull off the intake hose and watch while a buddy start turns the key on and works te gas pedal. Or video it with your phone while you do it alone.I think the key symbol in the dash indicates the condition of the security system. Check your owners manual. Check to see if there is an oil pressure shut down circuit also. What ever is causing the issue it seems to me it is shutting down the engine operation.As Mustangman suggested, I disconnect the MAF sensor and pulled off the intake hose and start and press on the gas pedal. The engine keeps running even after I were not pressing down the gas.
As soon as I reconnected MAF and the intake hose, the “start and then die” happened again.
Even if I opened the engine air filter box (just in case something there blocking the air; and I had replaced the engine air filter), the “start and then die” problem is there.
So it looks like something wrong with the MAF sensor?I can get reading on the scanner for MAF. MAF would start with about 0.3g/s to max ~12-14g/s and then dropped quickly back towards 0.
AFR(measured) would become 10.14 when starting and then become 29.40 when it dies.I did use a MAF cleaner to spray the sensor before starting to post here (although I don’t know if my cleaning is good).
Thanks you all. Any suggestion for what I should do next is greatly appreciated.Yes, it looks like some air side issue is shutting down the engine operation, because as I pulled off the throttle body intake hose, the engine can keep running (see my replies above).",,,,
310,Mazda tops in CR reliability survey,General Discussion,26,685,"Mazda has scored tops in Consumer Reports’ latest reliability survey. https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/mazda-consumer-reports-2020-auto-reliability-survey-74296414 9Good for Mazda. The limitations would be the fact that Mazda doesn’t sell as many cars, the dealerships are not always close to where you live.
I also have some other issues with these ratings. They might not reflect long term reliability. Also a lot of similar cars, don’t rank close. In this year’s ratings, the examples would be Kia and Hyundai (essentially the same company) and Chevy/Buick.
At the end of the day, I try not to buy from the bottom of the list, but buy something I like.Even better, Mazda is making some really good cars.  The CX-5 is at the top of my list.Bear in mind, those ratings involve vehicles as old as 2000 models, so that’s a potential indicator of long term reliability. We have a couple of friends who own 3s and love them. I found it interesting that one possible factor was Mazda using less tech than other makes. Dad used to say, “It’s just something else to break,” in regard to power steering, AC, etc.Dad was right, I had a Roper washer, it led the Consumer Reports reliability list.  It was made by Whirlpool just like Kitchenaid, Whirlpool and Kenmore,  it was made so that non Sears stores would have an economy model to compete with the low end Kenmore. As a result, it had less bells and whistles available than the other 3 brands but the same basic design. Hence greater reliability.A friend has a Mazda CX-5 that has been totally trouble free during the years she has owned it.  When I bought the Camry almost eight years ago the CX-5 made my short list and easily would again now if need be.We bought my daughter a 2015 Mazda 3 earlier this year. It’s our first Mazda. So far I’ve been very pleased and impressed. It’s not flashy or fancy by any means, but it’s a solid little car. Gets great gas mileage too.

There was a lot of premature rust problems with the Mazda 3 in the past.I think they fixed that issue by now.I read an article in the newspaper about this. Mazda’s success is laid mostly to not having as many advanced sensors in the car as other manufacturers use.I personally think cars are getting too complex nowadays. There’s a lot of wisdom to the “more stuff to break” mentality. Technology can be too “helpful” sometimes, to the point of creating complacency.
I also want my plain metal keys back, too. And get off my lawn, you kids! Mazda’s don’t have that problem here in the northwest but apparently not in the salt belt. My aunt’s 88 Honda CRX was like that after a few years living in the northeast.

You can’t compare a vehicle form 1988 to now. Starting in the mid to late 80’s manufacturers made huge improvements in rust protecting vehicles.

A couple of years ago I rented a late model Corolla and the “driver assist” features were simply a pain. It almost wasn’t worth using the cruise control because the collision avoidance system was integrated with it. Once it slowed the car when I was a good six car lengths behind the next vehicle at 40mph. Another time it warned me that I was about to rear end a car in the other lane, which would’ve been a neat trick.
OTOH, as far as I know blind spot monitoring on my wife’s Tucson is only active when you’re using a directional signal. If you change lanes without signalling you can still have an accident.
I also hate the thought of using a menu to turn on the heater (not that I’ve actually experienced that). Give me knobs and buttons.Had rental Charger in one east coast visit during deep freeze. Turning on the heat was a chore. Had to jump through hoops on the LCD screen. And when you finally had the heat on, the steering wheel would also warm up automatically. Was nice for the first few seconds, but as you started driving, it felt awkward. So, back to the screen to turn the steering wheel heat off and keep the cabin heat going. Now, that is technology.My rental Corolla had automatic temperature control with the AC (it was too warm for heat) but only when the air was coming out of the dash vents. When I selected dash+floor that feature was disabled. Just why? The people who designed the car apparently think they know more about what the driver wants than the owner of the car.

What good is blind spot monitoring if it doesn’t monitor the blind spot before you want to change lanes?  Our 2019 Odyssey monitors 100% of the time. My wife never reaches for the turn signal if the blind spot monitor is illuminated.


 jtsanders:

Beats me. I rarely drive it but I’m pretty sure that’s how it works. I don’t have the Owner’s Manual handy and I can’t find a decent .pdf but I’ll double check first chance I get.I test drove the Tucson with the BSM as I am in the market for one. There is a tiny light that comes on in your sideview mirror to indicate there is a car in your blind spot. If you have your turn signal on meaning you want to change lanes, then it beeps.
I had a rental Rogue and the light was inside the car and more visible. Despite the CVT, it did go on my short list of cars to buy. I might take a look at the CX-5 too. Used cars are difficult to find nowadays.
I had a CX-9, great driving car, but parts were not readily available even at the local dealer. Local dealer went out of business. Had the Ford Duratec engine and an Aisin transmission. The waterpump was chain driven and inside the engine. It would leak inside the engine. To change it, you have to take the whole engine and transmission out of the car, 14 hrs of labor. Brilliant.On the rav4 it beeps and flashes if there is a car coming up the street while backing out of the drive. Very Nice!@Barkydog; That is the rear cross traffic alert.

312,‘96 Pathfinder shakes at highway speeds,Maintenance/Repairs,11,2.3k,"Our Pathfinder shakes side to side around 60mph and quits after 65 or 70 (We live in New Mexico and commute through Texas where speeds are much higher than back East).

We have been driving this way since May of 2005 (129,916 miles). We have TRIED to get it fixed. We have had it in shops all across the country (we travel a bit). We talk it up to people we meet who know cars. We have taken it to Nissan, with no results. NO ONE has solved the problem and we are out lots of money.

You’ve found there’s a connection between the symptoms and application of power to the wheels:
You just take your foot off the gas for a few seconds and it stops. 
In my mind, that points to drivetrain.  Plus, considering all your tire and wheel and alignment efforts, it seems like you've eliminated those from the issue ....unless in all the work done thus far nobody has looked at the steering gear.  I have to assume that's been carefully considered....repeatedly.  Yes?
I presume your Pathfinder is 4wd.  I don’t know what would cause this problem in a 4wd or rear wheel drive vehicle, so I may be way off, but I’ve experienced symptoms like you describe from worn cv joints in a front wheel drive minivan.
Like I said, it’s just a wild guess.

Hate to break it to you, but the show is ALL RERUNS now.  Last newly recorded show aired six months ago, October 2012.

When these bushings wear out it allows the rear differential to move under the vehicle at speed causing the vehicle to shake from side-to-side.
TesterTester is correct. This is a known issue with the 96 thru 99 Pathfinder (I owned a 98). The rear bushings are shot. You can either replace the bushings (which I did) or replace the arms (which come with new bushings). The arms will have to be inspected to see if they are still good.
This is NOT cheap. If you do it yourself it’s less then $150. If you don’t then it’s about $600. It’s very labor intensive.Thank you all very much for your insight and suggestions.

They were built for highway cruising, not canyon carving.So this may explain why I hated riding in 1970s era big cars–yuck! I tried driving a

Think back to how everyone needed to “saw” left and right with the steering wheel on a fairly constant basis with the cars back in “the good old days”, just to try to stay in one’s lane.   Part of this was likely due to the old bias-ply tires, but a lot of it had to do with loosey-goosey steering.   If you did the same with a modern car, you would be darting all over the place.
So, between the marshmallow suspensions and the loosey-goosey steering, handling was pretty abominable in “the good old days”.


 VDCdriver:

This makes me wonder how I was able to drive my first car, a Chrysler Newport,
it had the bias-ply tires, but the steering was not so much loosey-goosey. Driving it
was a lot easier than a Buick of the same vintage.Handling wasn’t great, but the ride sure was comfy.Take a look at old Dragnet shows from the first TV version and then the version from the 1960’s. Those cars flopped like fish out of water. LOL


 seebear:

That’s because Buick was the worst offender when it came to overly-soft suspensions.   Most cars of that era were bad in that regard, but Buick was the worst of the lot.
When Chrysler introduced their torsion bar front suspension in 1957, all of their cars became the best-handling of all Detroit products of the era.All the 60s Ford automobiles that I ever worked on had zero compression resistance shocks as OE. When I replaced shocks for people and installed larger bore 50/50 shocks they were(imagine this) shocked at the improvement in ride.


 Rod-Knox:

Buick did that too even through the 80s and 90s.

That reminds me of a time years ago when I borrowed a coworker’s Buick. I could turn the wheel 1/4 turn in either direction with no effect. Nothing like my Mercury. I nearly had an accident before I learned to compensate.

For the most part Americans have forever tended to prefer under steer from their land yaughts while Continental Europeans preferred over steer.  “Unsafe at Any Speed” was responsible for trashing cars that were quite safe when driven by people accustomed to European cars.


 Rod-Knox:

And when people who drove them read and understood the owners manual when setting correct (correct for the Covair) tire pressures!Yep, tire pressure extremely important for Corvairs.  I would assume you would use the same pressures if using radials.


 Mustangman:

And when people who drove them read and understood the owners manual when setting correct (correct for the Covair) tire pressures!


When Chevrolet dealerships were polled in regard to the correct tire pressures for the Corvairs that they were selling, the vast majority of them just gave the boilerplate “26 psi all around” advice, even though that type of misinformation was likely to kill their customers.
When you design and market a vehicle that requires very unorthodox tire pressures for safe driving, it is incumbent on the manufacturer to make an extra effort to inform their customers, and GM failed to do that, unfortunately.  The fact that even their dealerships were usually clueless on this issue demonstrates GM’s failure to properly notify folks of the need for unusual tire pressures in this car’s tires.
On a side note, one of my mother’s work colleagues had persistent starting problems with her new Corvair, and the service manager brushed her off by telling her that because it had an aluminum engine block “the engine gets too cold”.   What’s the chance that this moron knew the correct–highly unorthodox–tire pressures for a Corvair?",,,,
314,2004 Volvo S80 slips,General Discussion,24,730,"I have a 2004 Volvo S80 which slips in first gear when it gets warm. When it slips, I have to shut the car off and turn on again, then it drives fine after that. Does Volvo have a sensor which detects that the transmission is low on fluid which causes it to do that? There have been times when I start the car, that it doesn’t want to go in to gear either.If you think the fluid level is low, and it acts like it is low, why not have it checked?
I have not heard of a fluid level sensor in a transmission. Temp and pressure, sure.Yes, the car has a sensor in it that should detect low fluids.
Generally, it’s called the Driver.
Check your manual for how to use the various dipsticks under the hood. If there isn’t a transmission fluid dipstick, that the car to a mechanic who can check it.Wow, what a bunch of you know what! If you know anything about the car, you would know its a sealed tranny. There is a dip stick way down in the engine bay that is not accessible. That is the reason for the question!Note the last part of my response, to take it to a mechanic so they can check it.
Regardless of the fluid level, it sounds like you have an issue with your transmission.
Good luck.Lack of a dipstick does not equal sealed.  I suspect this transmission has not had fluid changes performed at the normal interval of 30-50,000 miles.Maybe I should reword the question, does anyone know if the 2004 Volvo S80 has a sensor that will prevent the car from going in to drive or reverse if the transmission fluid is low.The 2004 Volvo has a sealed tranny according to Volvo and there isnt anything in the manual  about checking it. Supposedly according to Volvo, the fluid never needs relplaced. The car isnt mine but I have been looking to buy it at a real low price and it could be a real easy fix by just changing the fluid out and adding Lucas transmission fixIf you have not bought it yet run away,   buy something else.

If it was that simple to fix why has the seller not done so ? Because it is unlikely to help.  Look for something else.Agreed about running away from a used Volvo, especially one with a suspect transmission.
A friend of mine got a “great deal” on a used Volvo once. Turned out it was in the shop constantly for all sorts of issues…and every trip to the mechanic cost around $500 minimum.
There are plenty of other non-European used cars out there without suspect transmissions.Just watched a video on changing fluid. Has yellow dipstick. Just like my rig. The dipstick is hard to find. Got 3.5 qts on drain. Not much vs total capacity. I might do it on my torrent I got in July. I have to loosen front motor mount to do it. Annoying.If you believe it’s a “sealed tranny”, I have a bridge in Brooklyn I’d like to sell you for a bargain price.If you read my messages you know its not. Its got a dipstick way down in there. Volvo calls it that!

This is exactly what happened to me with a used SAAB, I’ll never buy another one–too many sob stories. The car was excellent, when it was out of the shop.I finally took the car for a drive, I didn’t feel the transmission slipping. What happens on occasion is when you come to a stop, the car will not go in to drive or reverse unless you shut it off and back on. That points to a fluid level issue which is very difficult to even check. I negotiated a price of $800 for the car. The car is in very good shape with no accident damage or even scratches. The tires are newer and the brakes pads were just replaced on the front. I thinks it worth a gamble. If it does turn out to be a bad tranny, I could easily sell the car for a $1000


 Greg-245:

Not necessarily, the fluid level increases by about one quart from cold to hot so low fluid level problems tend to go away after warm up.
The disengagement issue might be caused by a solenoid failure or a major failure. Start by checking the fault codes in the transmission control module or just change the fluid and pray.
It seems that most people fear buying an old car that needs work, isn’t this what the car hobby is all about?When I test drove the car, the engine was cold and at best warm when I finished. While checking it, I tried it in manual mode and didn’t work either. Besides some minor interior work and possible power steering pump, I consider it a weekend project car. I really don’t consider $800 a lot of money for a car to tinker with.A cheap project car. Is what it is. Maybe you can fix it?

 YoshiMoshi3:

Almost zero benefit .  And how many people are going to raise the hood and do that ?There is benefit. But not pressure to the oil cap, that does nothing.
A pre oiler, commercially known as a Accumsump, can be used to store a bit of oil under pressure that can be released before starting the engine to reduce wear. There are also electeically driven add on oil pumps that do the same thing.
Considering most modern engines will run well over 200,000 miles simply with proper maintenance, doesn’t seem worth the trouble or cost.


 Mustangman:

Considering most modern engines will run well over 200,000 miles simply with proper maintenance, doesn’t seem worth the trouble or cost.


You beat me to it!
A modern engine that is well-maintained can be expected to go 200k miles–or more–with no need for internal repairs.
By adding an external oil pump, it is possible that one might be able to extend the engine’s life by… a bit… but the usually-ignored transmission will need to be overhauled/replaced by then, and in many parts of the country, chassis rust problems would make it impractical to keep “the old car with a good engine” but with a multitude of other–serious–problems.I’ve read that while most engine wear occurs at startup it does not mean those first few seconds for oil pressure to build.
“Startup” means the period before the engine warms up.
The pistons and cylinders expand at different rates with the rising temperature.
The mismatch plays havoc with clearances.
There are Formula 1 engines built so tight they can’t rotate at room temperature, so they pre-heat the engine before starting.Why not just crank motor with ign/fuel off?The proper multi viscosity oil greatly reduces the wear at cold start up. Possibly more than pre-lubing. Pumping up oil pressure to a cold, still engine will not lubricate the cylinder walls, piston pins, and various timing components while the freer flowing modern multi viscosity oils can quickly be pumped and slung where needed.  Most notably, pistons and cylinder walls are not lubricated until oil is sprayed up onto the cylinders below the pistons when up and into the oil control rings when down. SAE 30 oil is too thick to properly lube that area at a startup below 30*F.They make pre-lubers for turbo engines.

319,Should I get an oil change now?,Maintenance/Repairs,64,1.6k,"Should I get an oil change now on my 2006 Toyota Corolla now or wait? My usual maintenance schedule is to get the oil changed every 5,000 miles or six months (That’s the recommended schedule listed in the owners manual). Usually I rack up thousands of miles on my car a month, but due to the pandemic stay at home, work from home and lockdown orders I’ve only put about 200-300 miles on my car since I got my last oil change in May of this year. I’m wondering if I should get my oil changed this month since it’s been six months, or rack up a couple more thousand miles first and then get it changed?I think you can wait but I wouldn’t go beyond a year.  I changed mine a little early just to get it done but on the car that just sat I would change once a year.  The last change had 7 miles in the year.My car warranty requires once a year. Yes when I was putting miles on spring and fall was the norm for 8000 miles a year. Had mine done in Sept, and like you I will be lucky to put 2500 miles on by next Sept. So I am going to let it go till next Sept. I am not saying do as I do, any oil change is better than no oil change.
You takes your chances and you pay your dues. We cannot predict if it will be a problem or not, there are no guarantees, so really you have to decide your risk reward tolerance. Mine is every 5k miles or once a year to maintain 7 year warranty, so I feel comfortable with that.Thanks. I have an oil change scheduled for later this month. I’ll probably keep it rather than rescheduling. They have so many no-contact rules now at the shop.


 D.J:

Usually I rack up thousands of miles on my car a month,


You live on an island ( Hawaii ? ) ? And is this the 2006 Corolla that you wanted to put Bed Liner material on the roof ?  How do you drive thousands of miles a month on an island ?Well, it’s probably about 1,000 miles a month I guess i was putting on my car for a couple years when I worked in town and lived in the country (40 miles each way for a total of 80) a day five days a week during rush hour. Plus errands on the weekend. The island might be only a hundred or so miles around but there are about 800,000 to a million people living here squeezed in.I’m not going with bedliner on the roof. Maybe a vinyl wrap someday when I can afford to have someone put it on so it looks OK.I used to drive 108 miles round trip on my 5 day commute, plus errands. That was good for about 25,000 miles per year.


 D.J:

I’m wondering if I should get my oil changed this month since it’s been six months, or rack up a couple more thousand miles first and then get it changed?


Once the warranty ran out on my 2006 Matrix (essentially the same car as yours) I went up to a year between changes, using conventional oil.
It typically took me 9 months to go 5000 miles.
No engine problems in 12 years.I do not  believe that a manufacturer warranty requires oil to be changed per the OCI.  But if not done, and the issue is an engine failure proximately caused by lack of oil changes, then you are out luckIf the reason that you put so few miles on it now is that you only drive it once or twice a week, or less, then you can put off the oil change.  If you drive it daily but only for very short trips, then you need to do it.I drive it 2-3 times a week for short trips.Yeah, it’s way out of warranty,  so I’m just trying to preserve the life of the engine.


 D.J:

I drive it 2-3 times a week for short trips.


Short trips are the worst thing that you can do to your engine, your battery, and your exhaust system.   Even though my local supermarket is only ~3.5 miles away, I make it my business to take a round-about route of about 8 miles to the supermarket,  just to get the oil more fully warmed-up, to give the battery a better charge, and to dry out condensation in the exhaust.  Even with taking intentionally longer drives to the supermarket and to Costco, I only wind-up having to put gas in the tank every 3-4 weeks.I’ve been driving it between 10 to 30 miles total per tripI think you are good to go for up to a year or 5k miles since your last oil change.Thanks for letting me know.I figured out that since May of this year, I’ve put 2,031 miles on my car, which if you divide it out by 7 months averages 290 miles a month. That’s what I’ve put on it since my last oil change in May. So not sure if I’m going to keep my oil change appointment or cancel it for November 18.


 D.J:

I’ve only put about 200-300 miles on my car since I got my last oil change in May of this year.


So now you are saying you put 2000 miles on the car since the last oil change and not 300?  Then I will change what I said and suggest getting the oil changed.  2000 miles in 6 months means short trips so change it.Yeah, 2000 is correct. I miscalculated when I said 300. It just felt like 300",,,,

It has a year warranty that I of course plan to take advantage of but I should mention I took it back to my mechanic and he in turn sent it back to them and of course at the time (about  2 weeks after getting it back the first time)  they couldn’t find an issue.  I’d like to get this straight since I live in Jersey and plan on driving it and a trailer of my stuff to Dallas.  Any suggestions?Yeah, take it directly to the transmission specialist and SHOW them your complaint. The hear-say chain is a sure way to confuse the issue.

.Thanks. I live in Hawaii,  a warm climate,  don’t drive too much. Drove maybe less than 5,000 miles probably in 2020 so far. Mixture of some short stop and go trips and some highway trips. Maybe about  a year since I had the air filter changed.I change the engine air and cabin air filters every 20,000.  Not that they are real bad but easy to remember.Is there a lot of dust in the air where you live?  I’d guess not. You can probably go a couple-a-three years before changing the engine air filter. If you change it yourself, you can inspect it and change as needed. Too dirty is when you think the dirt keeps air from flowing thorough the filter. You are estimating the % coverage of dirt on the filter.We have pretty good air quality where I live.Thanks for the information


 D.J:

We have pretty good air quality where I live.


Pretty clear air in Southern Minnesota too but still dust, dirt, and bugs collect on the filters.When does your owner’s manual tell you to change it? Why don’t you believe what the people who built your car recommend?Air filter replacement is usually listed in the maintenance schedule every 3 years/30,000 miles, more often if you live on a dirt road.
The lube techs are going to try to up-sell filters on every visit, if they don’t make up-sells they only make minimum wage.
I worked next to a used car technician for years that replaced air filters if there was a spec of dirt or a dead fly on the filter. The real reason for replacing the filters was because the company paid 1/2 hour labor to slide in two filters. Every used car received new filters and a wheel alignment, easy money.Six months is a bit much unless  there’s a ton of miles accumulated  and/or you’re out on the dirt roads a lot.
Around here I have to clean out the condenser on my central A/C unit twice a year; mostly due to milkweed. Once in early spring and again in mid summer.
Milkweed and wheat chaff along with other harvest debris kind of mucks up automotive air filters also.I once took my Miata to one of those quick-oil change shops, run by a major oil manufacturer. I decided I didn’t want the shop to do ANYTHING else to the car.  When I saw the tech start to open the hood and approach the air filter, I informed him that I didn’t want anything else other than the oil change. I saw the tech go to the manager, and after they talked, the manager came to me and told me that they were all out of the oil that my car needed (10W-30).  I haven’t gone to a quick change place for 15 years. Similarly, there are many places that I will not go for my car inspections.  I got kicked out of one station because they told me that in five years, they had never found anything wrong with my car, and they weren’t making any money.It takes 5 minute to remove an air filter.Why don’t you inspect it yourself instead of relying on what the mechanic says.You don’t need a lot of mechanic skill to do this…if my 3 year old grandson can do it so can you.Some air filters aren’t so easy to check, with hard to find/release clips and stiff hoses to the air intake.My previous car was a 2006 Toyota Matrix with the same engine as the Corolla.
The filter is easy to access and requires no tools.
The manual says every 30,000 miles for the filter, unless driving in dusty conditions, then it’s 15,000.
Later on I installed a restriction gauge; when it reached half the restriction limit I replaced the filter.
That took 43,000 miles.
So 30,000 miles is a safe and slightly conservative interval in most cases.Where are you taking it for the oil change? If it’s a quick change place (in which case, find a different place for a number of reasons) then most of them are trying to get every customer to replace the filter at every oil change because it makes them money.
They’ll often bring over a very dirty, ragged out filter to show you how badly it needs to be done, but it’s not uncommon for them to deceive you by using their own dirty filter rather than showing you the one that’s actually in your car.Its a Corolla and there is only 4 clips to release and pop out the filter.FWIW, I used to work for a supplier of air intakes, and Toyota was big on design for serviceability. The air box caps were always held on with 4 to 6 thumb clips and were readily accessible. GM for whatever reason secured theirs with torx screws. That was always a hassle.My Pontiac has clips but I do remember the brass screws.  You needed to use anti-seize on them to make sure you didn’t break the inserts out.go by the manual but if you just  drive on normal paved roads   filters last a long time .  30-35000 miles is a good target .  I have changed them at this mileage and even then they are not very dirty at all .",,,,

 sheyward_172508:

so I won’t get screwed over my the mechanic.


I would suggest if you don’t trust this mechanic not to screw you, you need a new mechanic. One more honest than this one.Not being able to put it in gear when running is more likely a problem with the clutch master or slave cylinders, or not enough fluid because of a leak.  I don’t see how the transfer case would be involved.  A worn out clutch disc will allow shifting, but you won’t go anywhere, the engine will just rev.2003 Jeep Liberty sportOh, okay. Question, what does the transfer case have to do anyway and how would it not be involved?
So basically I would need a clutch kit replacement or a slave cylinder.If you are that distrustful of the mechanic, why not take the Jeep to a mechanic you do trust?If the slave cylinder is internal, I would have it done at the same time as the clutch.
As far as the transfer case, I don’t know.  Is it shifted electrically?The OP has not clearly said what it means that he cannot put it into gear.
Questions:

If you start when in neutral, is it grinding that makes it impossible to shift?..or does it feel very, very stiff?
If you have the car off, then put it into reverse, then start the car with the clutch floored…does the car creep backwards? (Do this in an open area.)
Is your clutch slave cylinder internal or external?
Your absolutely right about that.“ The OP has not clearly said what it means that he cannot put it into gear.
Questions:

If you start when in neutral, is it grinding that makes it impossible to shift?..or does it feel very, very stiff?
If you have the car off, then put it into reverse, then start the car with the clutch floored…does the car creep backwards? (Do this in an open area.)
Is your clutch slave cylinder internal or external?”

Yes, when I start it in neutral, I can’t put it into gear.
When I start the car in a gear and when trying to shift out into another gear, it won’t work.
I’m not sure slave cylinder internal or external. I’m pretty sure it’s internal.Question 2: does the car creep even though the clutch is fully depressed?Good news: RockAuto pictures your slave cylinder and it is external. Repairs are easier to diagnose and are much cheaper.
A good mechanic can easily identify a problem with the clutch hydraulic system. RockAuto says this system is hard to bleed, so you might have acquired an air bubble which would show the symptoms you describe.The quick way to describe your problem is that the clutch is not fully disengaging, even with the pedal to the floor. While this might be an internal problem with the pressure plate or the clutch discs, you would definitely want to rule out the hydraulic system first. A bubble in the system would act as if the clutch is not fully depressed.Okay. Now I got the clutch fix. Now the car won’t stay on. The mechanic is saying it’s the exhaust pipe.
Their was nothing wrong with my car starting and staying on, now it won’t stay on.

Google Maps guided me into the center of a cemetery, and announced that I had arrived at my destination.  
Because this was my first time using Google Maps, I figured that I had done something wrong, so I exited from the cemetery, drove a couple of miles, turned around and headed back in the direction that the app indicated.  Once again… into the cemetery.
It turned out that, in addition to the cemetery not being a park, it had directed me to the wrong town, and I was at least 10 miles from where I actually wanted to go.   A few weeks later, I gave Google Maps another chance, and it directed me to drive across RR tracks in a location where there was no crossing.
Ever since then, I use either the GPS installed in my car, or I use WAZE, and neither of them has ever been “off” by more than a block or two.The problem with GPS n my 2017 Rav4 is it costs $700 to update the GPS. There has been highway remodels, and have run into a few exits that have gone to the opposite side of the road that gps instructs. So  I use my old garmin with lifetime free map updates. The screen is getting a little dim so I may need to upgrade the unit, which I will do with LTM updates rather than $700 for a static maps update. Can’t trust it

Before Covid I was traveling at least once a month. I’ve used Google Maps from my Iphone for years…and not once did I have a problem. I’ve probably used Google Maps several hundred times in the past 5+ years. What I find Google Maps to be better at is traffic. It gives me different routes depending on traffic. It seems to have much better traffic updates.Our Acura Nav was only $200 to update, but even with the update it missed the new four lane road that was built.  Looked like we were driving through a 30 mile corn field.  Tom Tom I think is the product.About four or five years ago we were on vacation in Michigan and decided to drive up and take the ferry to Mackinac Island. I used our laptop to get Google Maps directions. At one point we found ourselves on a country road with a “pavement ends” sign. There was also a reference to a bridge that we never saw.Going to a friends house we were given a map that showed where her driveway is since if you’re following your GPS it says you’ve arrived after you pass the driveway. I grew up on a private road that shows up now but for some time it give’s up at the end of the road where the mailbox’s are.There are actually two ferries to Mackinac Island, One from Mackinaw City in the lower peninsula and the other from St. Ignace in the upper peninsula.  We stay overnight ie either place when we go to Green Bay and we watch the ferries ply back and forth.  Mackinaw Island is an interesting place to visit, but once is enough.  I feel the same way about Disney World.
I finally broke down and bought a GPS last year                                                                                                             . $49 for a Chinese Garmin clone but I only use it for the voice prompts about where to turn. I study the route before I go on my computer or a map.
I don’t need glasses for driving but I cannot see the GPS screen without reading glasses, and I can’t drive with reading glasses.  I don’t like to take my eyes off the road long enough to read a route anyway.

Until I get cataracts . . . I’m hoping I won’t, but I assume it will eventually happen if I live long enough . . . nobody’s taking a scalpel or laser to my eyes


I had cataract surgery about 20 years ago, and the technology (which could have changed by now…) didn’t involve a scalpel.   Instead, the surgeon inserted a special needle which vibrated ultrasonically in order to–literally–liquify the old cloudy lens.
Then, the old, now-liquified lens was suctioned out.   Through the same tiny incision, a folded soft plastic lens was inserted, and it was truly amazing to see the folded lens unfold like the petals of a flower as I gazed at the surgical lighting.   Obviously, I was both sedated and anesthetized for the procedure.
I had both eyes operated on (outpatient basis), about 2 years apart, and the result is that I now only need to wear glasses for very close work, or for driving.   Anything in between, I don’t need to wear glasses anymore.Like I said . . . until I get cataracts which warrant a procedure . . . nobody’s “messing” with my eyes
I’ll wear contacts and glasses until that point . . . to be specific, contacts at work, and glasses at home and on the weekendsI had mine done nine year’s ago with laser never regretted it or needed glasses since.All of the people I know who’ve had lasik and cataract procedures do indeed still need glassesMy MIL doesn’t. She had her surgery about five years ago. The lenses have a near and far prescription, kind of like bifocals. The difference is that the two prescriptions are concentric rings. Most people get used to it. Pretty amazing. She said she needs reading glasses for very small print, but doesn’t need them for reading the newspaper.",,,,

326,1995 Ford Ranger/Mazda B2300,Maintenance/Repairs,10,345,"Simple question for a good mechanic:  I am replacing the rear leaf spring shackle including the support.  I had to grind off some pretty major rivets.   Would a real mechanic have torched these off? If so, how would they avoid damaging the beam supporting the studs?I would have ground them off as you did. I own a torch, makes too big a hole, the grinder makes less work of it down the road.
Full disclosure, not a pro mechanic.When you install the new parts, I hope you’re using grade 8 . . . or the equivalent metric, which should be  10.9 . . . hardwareThe new parts from Dorman came with bolt/nut hardware.  The bolts are black. I don’t know the name of the nuts, which are chrome plated.  They jam on the bolt, presumably for a lock nut effect. There are no lock washers. Is the black bolt a Grade 8?Please post a picture of the bolts, specifically the head of the boltI just finished the shackle job, and am a bit exhausted. Maybe in the AM. The head of the bolt said 10.9 if I remember correctly.  The jam nuts are surprisingly stiff to put on.
I learned a lot while doing this, so the next one should be easier.  I am sincerely hoping there is not a next one.
YouTube suggests getting the bolt+rubber out of the leaf spring end by burning it or heating it to melt the rubber. I ran a drill through the rubber a few times, and got the bolt out.The kits have self locking nuts. They are difficult to turn when the bolt reaches the final 2 threads which are undercut or have plastic inserts.
Did the kit come with a new spring bushing? If not then get a new one. drilling that rubber ruined it.Yes, a new bushing.  I had to improvise with a gear puller to get it in.  I was glad to ruin the old bushing since the bolt would not come out, making it necessary.
My nuts were undercut.


 oldnotdeadyet:

My nuts were undercut.


Since this is a family-friendly site, I won’t give my COVID-brain response to this.The nuts are zinc plated, not chrome. Chrome if for dress up not for undercar parts. Likely the nut is deformed on the last 2 threads and that is the locking mechanism.
The 10.9 is the metric equivalent roughly to SAE English grade 8I really appreciate the warning about the required grade. If Dorman had not included them, I would have purchased a much lower grade. I’ll remember that for the future.

No.
Did you check the hub flanges for rust prior to installing the new rotors?

TesterYes! Took a wire brush and did a pretty good job cleaning them up. Painted rotors didn’t suggest any grease, but I put a thin layer of high-temp grease on anyway. Is that where I could have messed up?Where did you apply the grease on the rotors?
TesterPossibly.  Adding grease to something that shouldn’t be greased could have disastrous results.I applied grease to the hub flange.Maybe better not to go over the top, eh? Next time I’ll skip the grease.That’s fine.
I apply a thin coat of ant-seize to the hub flange after removing the rust.

Factory brakes . . . usually very expensive, but I’ve never had problems right out of the box and certainly no noise complaints or scoring of the rotors due to junky ceramic brake pads
do NOT get Wagner Thermoquiet.  they are anything BUT quiet
Centric brakes are often pretty good
Bendix is also pretty decent
But don’t get the “budget” lines of any brand, no matter what the particular brand happens to be
I would also avoid NAPA brakes . . . ESPECIALLY the ceramic brake pads.  They are noisey,  score the rotors AND the brakes also don’t grab very well.  A lose-lose situation

With that info I doubt that the engine is misfiring. They wouldn’t return the vehicle to you running on three cylinders, it wouldn’t be drivable, not enough power to make it out of the parking lot.
When a customer complains that the engine doesn’t idle as smooth as they want, “try different gasoline” will send the customer away and allow the technician to go back to work fixing real problems.Thanks for the info, so if it is not misfiring then what could be the issue for it randomly smooth, then like 2 cylinders had quit, then smooth, then…… and sometimes stumbling on acceleration? Why would the diagnostics show nothing wrong?
Appreciate your sharing…
RandyWe let cars sit in our family in both New England and Florida for 6 months every year. We disconnect the battery, then hook it back up six months later and they start up and run normally. We have never had any problem with the gas and don’t use any stabilizer. Sorry to hear your predicament, but wanted to offer some evidence that it may not be gas.OK, thanks was looking for a known issue with this little turbo 1.4 engine that was out there.

RandyBear in mind that a problem won’t necessarily produce a code, something I learned on this forum. And you’ve already been told the dealer’s mechanic blew you off because you don’t have a “real” problem. Take it to an independent shop for a seat-of-the-pants diagnosis.Thanks, seems counterintuitive that there would be no code for half the engine running off and on randomly, but I will give that a try, take it to my trusted local independent guy. I work on classic cars as a hobby, but I have no idea what I am looking at under the hood of new cars.How do you know it’s running on 2 cyl?
You have no misfire codes.

The OP didn’t say it’s running on two cylinders, just that it feels like it’s running on two. Whatever the problem is, the dealer already blew him off precisely because there are no codes. That doesn’t mean there’s not something wrong.Yes, just stumbles terribly. Getting local opinion thanks",,,,
331,Mercedes Diesel with 250K+ miles - good buy?,Maintenance/Repairs,41,15.5k,"Is it safe to buy a Mercedes E300 Turbo Diesel with over 250K miles on it? From pictures it’s in good shape, and I know that some diesel engines can last a long time, but that’s a lot of miles.

 Anyone have any thoughts about how much life would be left in a Mercedes engine with that many miles? This is a 1998 car.If you think $2,000 to $3000 in unforseen repairs per year is acceptable then you’ll be fine.Any car past 8yrs/150,000 miles irregardless of brand is risky and not a safe bet. The major problem with MB is repairs are very expensive.There are lots of myths regarding diesel reliability.  I read some facts about a guy with a older MB with 2,000,000 miles.  Guess how many engine rebuilds?  Eight, about one every 250k miles.  So no, I don’t think you’ll get a lot of trouble free miles out of the one you’re looking at.If it’s cheap enough it may be a good buy and I would easily wager good money that a competent tech could look this car over (as with any 250k miles car) and come up with a laundry list of needed repairs.
You’re concentrating on the engine longevity but you should keep in mind the transmission, rear axle, suspension, and who knows what else may be due for something.
It’s impossible to tell from pictures if a car is in good shape or not.You ask if it is a good buy but don’t give the price?  It was a good car, but is it a good car now?  Much depends on who owned it and how well it was cared for by the previous owner(s).  If you need repairs, who will do the work?  Are you going to fix it yourself?  Do you have a good mechanic who knows how to repair an MB diesel?  This is not a car that just anyone can work on.
I’d say you are likely going to spend a lot of money on this car over the next 5 years.  If you are looking for a dependable, long lived car, that is relatively cheap to repair; this ain’t it.It looks good because Mercedes cars have good bodies!
I have personally ridden in a company Mercedes overseas which had 900,000 km on it, or 562,000 miles and the original engine ran perfectly. However, this car, a 1985 model, had been babied by the oil company’s personnel, since the import duty on this car was 140%! Skilled labor costs were about $3 per hour.
However, buying a car like this with such high mileage in the US, where the original drver leased it and did not bother with maintenance, and the next owner may have skimped because it is so expensive, would turn this into a complete crapshoot with respect to reliability.
However the upkeep will be expensive, even if the car is perfect (not likely), and I would increase the previous poster’s estimate to $3500+ per year to keep it running . If that’s OK with you, go ahead.
The wife of a used Jaguar owner told me once tht her husband’s hobby was better than drinking and chasing loose women!A properly maintained diesel motor can last well over 350k. Unlike gas engines, diesel requires little in the way of maintenance other than filter and oil changes. Using proper filters and proper oil will give you all the engine life you ever wanted or expected. Mostly when people say that upkeep of a diesel motor is expensive is because they are paying someone else to maintain it for them and that mechanic you’ve chosen charges excessive because you as the owner believe that you are expected to pay high maintenance to keep it running. And your mechanic is laughing all the way to the bank. Changing oils and filters on a Mercedes diesel is about the easiest thing to do. I would never own any gas engine.

It will live on until you run out of money entirely. That should take no more than two years tops. Your statement “From the pictures. . .” suggests to me that the car is on Craigslist or EBay.

As texases said deals done.The horse mummified over the last six years.  It’s time to beat it again!I feel proud.  I actually recognized the title as an old thread.
(What’s to be proud?)the first thing I would do is track down the maintenance records. Maintenance / oil change is the life blood of the engine. If the oils & filters for both engine & transmission have been changed on a regular basis, there’s a good chance that your motor & Tranny will last their expected life of 350k miles or more. The year of the vehicle means little, the maintenance of the vehicle means everything.The beating continues…

Filters and oil changes?  Oh how I wish.  True MB uses a better injector pump than the Stanadyne used on the Olds, but geeze they were still $500 and I can’t remember how many I went through.  Glow plugs, relays, injectors, cracked fuel lines, a $300 starter, head gaskets and $10 head bolts, vacuum pump, and on and on.  Not to mention fuel conditioner all the time in the winter to avoid gelling, and pulling the tank to clean the junk out.  No more diesels for me.  I just can’t afford that kind of reliability and economy.Opinions will vary. The true beating of the dead horse is the constant response to an old  posting, as if it were a horrid thing.

332,Might have to salvage my car! Please help!,Maintenance/Repairs,14,574,"I drive an 07 Nissan Versa, used mainly for work and university so it racks up a lot of mileage. Past few weeks I have been having issues with an oil leak, took it to the mechanic who pointed to a loose screw on the valve covers as the culprit. They changed the valve cover gasket, added silicone, and on top of that, even rethreaded the slot where the screw goes since that was apparently an issue. After all of that, I took the car home and just a day later, the car started leaking oil again, and this time in crazy amounts. I lose half a quart in a day!! Took it back to the mechanic who sounded like he gave up on it and said there isn’t anything more he can do. I want to give up on it as well but I don’t have any other car and can’t afford a new one, previous repairs on this car already cost me a ton! I need help/advice, anything would be of great help since I am now at a dead end. Without car in hand, I cannot tell you what this problem is or how to solve it. I generally don’t like to badmouth another mechanic but if this guy cannot fix or figure out how to stop a valve cover leak he needs to surrender his tool box and find another line of work.
He’s overlooking an obvious flaw somewhere. How about another opinion from a different shop?
Just some food for thought, but maybe there’s an issue with the PCV valve. A faulty PCV can cause the engine crankcase to pressure up and force oil to leak out of the engine at various places. A PCV is considered a normal maintenance item to be checked every so often and they’re cheap. Generally 10 to 25 dollars or so. To me anyway, the PCV is the first thing to look at when there’s an issue with oil leakage. Sorry I can’t be of more help.


 Talha:

I don’t have any other car and can’t afford a new one, previous repairs on this car already cost me a ton!


Doesn’t make sense.  If you hadn’t spent a ton on it, you could afford a new one?  It shouldn’t be that hard to find the leak.  I suspect at a half quart a day, it isn’t leaking out of the valve covers.  I’ve lost that kind of oil with a sending unit failure, oil pan gasket, broken oil line, etc. but not a valve cover.


 Talha:

Took it back to the mechanic who sounded like he gave up on it and said there isn’t anything more he can do.


Perhaps the rear main crankshaft seal is leaking and replacing it is beyond his capability. There must be more that one auto repair shop in a university town.I would take it to another shop but the “faulty screw” that he blamed for the oil leak was actually last touched by the same shop, a year back when I did replace the same valve cover gaskets. And also, the oil wasn’t leaking as bad until after I had this recent most work done, so I think I might try taking it back to them because you’re probably right, they definitely missed something in the process of changing my gaskets this time around. I also just purchased a new PCV valve which I’ll be changing shortly, hoping it makes a difference The leak is coming from the same spot, around the valve cover, and he did his best work on the new gasket which is why I think he was disheartened and gave up on it. I will try a new shop after I ask them to take one last look at it since the leak magnified after they did their work. Before they worked on it, the leak was nowhere near as bad it is right now. There’s legitimately a 2 ft wide wet stain under my car every morning Wasn’t suggesting that I could afford a new car with the repair costs, just that I’m broke  and we isolated the leak to be coming from the valve cover because it would start from the top of the engine on the side opposite to the oil pan.


 Talha:

Seems impossible for a valve cover to leak that much while the car is parked, there is no oil stored in the valve cover area when the engine is off. Is the oil collected by an cover under the engine, then dripping overnight?
For a mess that big I would suspect that the drain plug is loose, an easy repair.


 Nevada_545:

Seems impossible for a valve cover to leak that much while the car is parked, there is no oil stored in the valve cover area when the engine is off. Is the oil collected by an cover under the engine, then dripping overnight?


I agree with this. 1 qrt of oil a day is a lot of oil for a valve cover gasket. It’s not under pressure. And you’d also have a lot of smoke inside the engine bay because that oil is going to drip down the engine and burn off. Something else is going on.So while I was changing the PCV valve as per your suggestion, I noticed a missing bolt around where the oil is coming from. Is that possibly the cause of the leak? There’s just no way my mechanic missed this since he looked at it twice over before he gave up on it.
image3024×4032 2.73 MBI cannot figure out what goes in that hole. I pulled up pics of several used Versa heads of that era and the only thing I could see  was a slotted screw. I have no why that screw is missing or why your guy overlooked it but it seems to me that a slotted screw should be a necessity.  You may have to check with a Nissan dealer on this and a screw should not be expensive. This is all assuming I was looking at those heads correctly.
First step is make sure the oil level is FULL and keep it that way until sorted out. You might try letting the engine idle and note if you see any oil  coming from anywhere up top; either around that hole or the valve cover. If not, and with a leak this big, the oil drain plug, oil filter gasket, or possibly the  oil pressure sending unit  is leaking.
I can’t say that I agree with your guy using silicone. That to me is grasping and silicone should not be needed on a valve cover installation on any modern era car. It was common for GM back in the 70s and 80s to install valve covers with no gaskets at all with only the use of RTV sealant but those covers were stamped steel and RTV actually worked better.I wonder if he damaged the valve cover?A small oil leak can look like a big leak on the ground after you’ve been driving and the oil has been blown all over the bottom of the engine and dripped all over the pavement after parking. So start off by bringing the oil up to full and checking it daily to see how much you’re actually losing.
If it’s less than a quart a month and you’re tight on funds, you might want to just keep an eye on it.
That being said, Nissans at around that age seem to have a problem with the sparkplug well oil seal gaskets giving up the ghost and leaking there. Not a major problem so get a second opinion, preferably from someone familiar with Nissans.The pic you gave us looks pretty clean. Not a lot of old oil or other gunk on there. If that’s the case for the whole engine, then it shouldn’t be too hard to figure out where the leak is coming from. If you could narrow that down for us, we’d have a much easier time giving you ideas as to what it might be.
As another option, you can go to an auto parts store and get a leak finder kit. It has UV dye and a UV flashlight and often some tinted glasses. You dump the dye into your oil, run the engine for awhile, then close the garage door, turn off all the lights (or wait till it’s dark if you don’t have a garage) and shine the light around until you see the glowing dye. That tells you where the leak is.With an oil leak that size, you should be able to see the trail of oil from the leak.  First thing is to determine if it is the valve cover.  Dry it off with a rag or paper towels.  Then dust all around the gasket area with some talcum or baby powder.  Run the engine for a few minutes and if there is a leak, you will soon see it.
Next, follow the spot on the ground to the point on the engine just above it and look for a trail of wet oil leading to the leak.  You may find it this way.  you could dust the whole engine with powder and find the leak after a few minutes of driving.
Take a straight edge (ruler or stick of wood etc) and align it to the front edge of the valve cover. Now check the areas line the fire wall, radiator etc that the stick is pointing too for oil.  Also on the shield directly under the engine.  If you see a ring of oil, the front seal has failed.  This is quite common on engines with a timing chain.  The timing chain cover could also be leaking if the oil is only on the shield.
On more often overlooked leak is the oil pressure sending unit.  They will spray oil out but generally do not leak once the engine is off, but they can spray a lot of oil out that drips from the engine bay after the engine is shut down.
If this oil leak appeared suddenly right after your last oil change, it could be the oil filter gasket, oil filter not tightened or the drain plug not tightened or cross threaded.  Most drain plugs also use a gasket that is supposed to be changed at each oil change but very seldom are.",,,,
333,Is it true that Hyundai wont repair or replace one of thier engines,Maintenance/Repairs,58,5.7k,"Is  it rue that   Hyundai wont fix one of their engines  that fails  under the warranty?
The federal class action lawsuit alleged that Hyundai 7 sold Sonata vehicles with defective rotating assemblies in the Theta II 2.4 L engines that cause sudden and catastrophic engine failure. When the rotating assembly fails, it does so without warning and causes the engine to abruptly seize, according to the complaint. The complaint also alleged:
Rather than addressing this safety problem by warning drivers and recalling its dangerous vehicles, Hyundai has concealed the problem from consumers and implemented a concerted practice of denying warranty coverage for failed engines. Hyundai tells Sonata owners that they must submit a complete record of the vehicle’s maintenance history before making a warranty claim—even though it knows that Sonata engines fail regardless of owner maintenance and that the faulty rotating assembly is responsible. For those warranty claims that are submitted, Hyundai’s practice is to deny them based on inadequate maintenance records or improper maintenance. Hyundai denies that engine failures are widespread in Sonata vehicles and blames its customers for the problem—forcing them to pay as much as $10,000 for an engine replacement.Why are you asking ?  It could be that the owner did something to void the warranty or the failure was not covered by the warranty.  And what is with the bold print ?I’m sure that’s not true as a rule, and I’m sure that is true if the engine has been abused, or if the owner can’t show records of proper maintenance.You will have to be much more specific regarding the exact model, model year, and maintenance record of said Hyundai in order to get a response with value.Your post pretty much answers your question.If you’ve followed the guidelines of the maintenance schedule in the owners manual (and can provide documentation) and are in the warranty period, I don’t see how they could legally deny a claim.You are right about that, they couldn’t deny coverage…
But, how many folks can do that?  How many folks are organized enough to keep their receipts if not done at the dealer? 50%? Less? I’d guess less than 50%. But then their engine blows up and they decide Hyundai and Kia are off the list of new cars forever.Agreed. Wouldn’t buy a hyundai myself at this point. But I imagine others are the same. If you can’t document it, you didn’t do it.
It sucks and all, but it is what it is. I don’t think Ford, for example, would warranty an engine within the warranty period without documentation of oil changes?


 Mustangman:

How many folks are organized enough to keep their receipts if not done at the dealer? 50%? Less? I’d guess less than 50%. But then their engine blows up and they decide Hyundai and Kia are off the list of new cars forever.


But… they were “saving money” by not having their maintenance done at the dealership…
I do my own work. I keep receipts for fluids and filters. I’ve often wondered if I’d get denied if I had a claim. ‘
‘Tis a gamble I’m willing to take, though. Ever since the GM dealership left my wife’s oil fill cap off on the first free oil change!  Rather just do it myself, take my time, and know it’s done right. Saving money is a bonus.I don’t know anyone with a Hyundai or Kia newer than 2007, which obviously do not contain the defective engines.  That being said, from what I have read online, it does appear that the default reaction when a customer brings in their vehicle with a failed engine is to claim “customer abuse” due to sludge formation, and deny warranty coverage.
This is really no different than how Chrysler treated customers with its 2.7L V-6 engine.  I worked at a Chrysler/Plymouth dealer for about a year back when this engine was being sold, and it became very apparent that customers were having issued with this engine developing bad bearings, timing chain collapse, and with sludge formation which was thought to be due to the internal water pump leaking.  Even cars which were meticulously maintained at the dealer had failed engines at low mileage, and Chrysler tried to weasel out of covering the problem under warranty.
Sure, Chrysler might have saved some money denying coverage for their design defect back then, just as Hyundai/Kia is saving money now.  But I think it’s safe to say that people who were forced to take a loss of many thousands of dollars to replace a defective engine or unload the vehicle would sooner take poison than buy another Chrysler (or Hyundai/Kia) product, so I think this strategy is short-sighted at best.According to CR data, most Hyundai cars 2010-2017 have much better than average reliability in the categories Engine, Major; Engine, Minor; and Engine, Cooling. The only worse than average rating in these categories from 2010-2017 was Engine, Major in the 2011 Hyundai Sonata.
Hyundai deserves respect for this record. If Hyundai won’t repair or replace one of their engines, it’s probably because the owner can’t prove the engine was well cared for, according to Hyundai’s requirements.
It’s possible that Consumer Reports readers (whose experience with car repair CR relies upon) have a higher than average rate of compliance with carmakers’ maintenance requirements, so a lower rate of car problems.Just because a class action suit was filed or even settled does not mean that the engines are defective.
Getting through all of the smoke and mirrors one usually finds that the owner is responsible for the problems due to neglected oil change intervals or failure to check the motor oil level. Of course said owners will never believe that any problems are due to their neglect…I’ve been following this Theta II saga on the Hyundai forums (I have a Tucson with a different family engine).
There are lots of posts from people getting their long/short blocks replaced without  resistance from Hyundai.
There’s irritation about losing the use of a car with well under 100K miles for weeks.
Only denial with details I saw involved sludge and poor service records.we all know when the dealer has your car in for a timing belt change  they find other  unnecessary things wrong to tab up the bill . and the oil change I once had on my 85 Toyota cost me a new fan belt they cut off the old belt [ non serpentine

Oh and one bolt was missing   on the  timing cover and candy wrappers and cigarette buts in the-bottom splash pan.so you figure if its cheaper at the dealer.

It’s unfortunate that you dealt with a particularly dishonest dealership, but to tar all dealerships with that same brush is not very different from ascribing the same characteristics to all people of a certain race, religion, or ethnicity.  Many years ago, Sixty Minutes did an expose on gas stations in “Dixie” that cut customer’s fan belts while checking their oil.   Should we automatically conclude that all gas stations south of the Mason-Dixon line are similarly dishonest?
I have bought 3 cars (so far) from the same dealership because they have always treated me fairly.  My first car that I bought from them suffered from a breached head gasket at ~115k miles, long after the warranty had expired.   All of the vehicle’s maintenance had been done at that dealership, and instead of the massive bill that I was expecting for the replacement of both head gaskets, they charged me a little over $300.
Whether there was some “goodwill” from the manufacturer involved in that very low billing, or whether the dealership itself gave me a lot of “goodwill”, I have no doubt that the dealership was instrumental in me not being raked-over the coals.   Whether the manufacturer or the dealership absorbed much of the cost of that repair I don’t know (and don’t actually care), but having had all of my maintenance done at that dealership undoubtedly played a large part in being charged so little for that repair.No one ever wants to take responsibility for their own failures these days.  People don’t do basic maintenance and then try to blame the car maker.  It seems that some engines are more forgiving of neglect than others.  This isn’t one of those.
I deal with the general public on a daily basis and have heard some doozies!just lucky  most dealers are  for the money$$$


 lesabre1:

Wow! What an outlook…
Most businesses are in it for the money. Non-profit organizations are not in it for the money.
The businesses that realize customer satisfaction and positive word-of-mouth advertising helps grow the business are often the most successful and most profitable.
To be in it for the money certainly does not necessarily include ripping people off and excluding customer goodwill. I’d say it’s more likely the ones that operate without regard for that will become unsuccessful and unprofitable.
The good dealers spend quite a bit of money surveying customer satisfaction and responding to feedback, especially negative feedback. Some must do this in compliance with manufacturers and actually get different rates on products based on outcomes.
P.S. I do nearly all of my own car repairs and maintenance and seldom take my cars to any professionals, but my dealer experiences have always been  honest, positive, and fair. Plus I get a wash and vacuum and follow-up phone call.

Also my main goal here is to find a car with a good proof of oil and transmission maintenance so I know I won’t have any serious issues caused by poor maintenance. I am willing to pay up to 8k as long as I find one with good maintenance records.
Is it too much ? not sure what would be a smart move to buy a reliable car to save some money on repairs in the long run. Paying more or less ? Lexus or Toyota or maybe even another brand that is as reliable ?

So yeah any tips advices would be much appreciated thank you all in advance.


 gandhi_s-flip-flop:

I was wondering if it is worth buying a lexus over toyota.


Only you can answer that. Lexus isn’t going to be more reliable than Toyota. Only more luxurious. To me, it was worth it. Others wouldn’t see the need.
That said, at $8k, you’re probably going to find that the Lexus ES is about the same price as the Toyota equivalent, the Avalon. That’s because luxury cars tend to depreciate faster than regular cars, and by the time a Toyota is old enough to cost only 8 grand, it’s fairly old and the equally-old Lexus would have lost enough value to bring it down to the Toyota’s level.
Whatever you get, it’s going to be old, and you’ll be lucky if there’s any maintenance records at all. You’ll want a pre-purchase inspection before you buy.
Based on a quick look, you’ll be shopping for early to mid 2000’s cars with 100,000+ miles on them.A car is a machine.
All machines wear out from use (mileage), corrosion (age) or damage (accidents or lack of maintenance)
Since most similar machines share the same basic technology, most of the cost difference goes towards, size, comfort and status.
However, part of the difference may also be in the machine’s materials and the manufacturer’s quality control.
That’s the basics, so it’s just a matter of finding your optimal solution at your price point.
My personal preference for someone in your situation would be a “no nonsense Grand Dad’s car”.
A one owner, basic sedan, low mileage, regular maintenance, garage kept, rarely driven in rain,  never in snow, at night or over 50 mph.Some of the retirement communities will have such cars being sold by the remaining family member(s).What s your budget?  I’d get a Camry instead of the ES350 for any given budget.At this point in your life, you are probably better served by a less expensive car. A Toyota Corolla or Yaris, depending on the age, could be a good choice.Mind going to ND? Sure a little political but 1 in 1000 have died of Covid, could be some good car deals.Consumer Reports keeps records on used cars.  They have an auto issue every April(?).  I read the library’s copy.  Better yet, I use the library’s on-line subscription from home.  The last time I looked Honda’s Fit was the most reliable and one of the cheapest to own.If you want reliability and low cost of operation, the less bells and whistles the better.  I would need at least a Camry, but is you can get comfortable in a Corollam it would be a better choice.
Bear in mind, that inused cars, condition is king. Also, with all the people chasing Toyotas and Hondas, there are other makes that can be good bargins, especially if you do your own repair work.We bought a 2015 Mazda 3 hatchback for my daughter for $7250 earlier this year. It’s our first Mazda. I’ve been very pleased with it.Ideal used vehicle ?  It could be almost any brand , any year or even the amount of miles it has traveled.  When looking at used vehicles each one must stand on its own .  That is why most members here say pay a shop to look it over . That will not keep one from having problems but puts the odds in your favor.
As for service records very few used vehicles will have them or easily checked .
Edit:  Back on 11/03 you asked about scams regarding selling a 1996 mystery vehicle .  I guess you still have it as you need a vehicle for work . You have several choices but in your case you should think of several things while you are still in school.
Could this present vehicle be made usable for less than the 8000.00 figure ?  It might be best to trade it in at a good used vehicle lot to avoid the scams you are worried about .I know you’re focused on the initial quality ratings here, but keep in mind that a $50,000 car that’s depreciated to $8,000 is going to be much older and more used up than a $25,000 car that’s depreciated to $8,000. If I were in your position, I’d be looking for a small Kia or Hyundai sedan or hatchback.Good luck on finding a car with full maintenance records and keep in mind that the majority of used cars are not properly maintained. This is especially true of cars which have had 2 or more owners.
You should not be fixated on the brand so much. Everything with wheels breaks and as a mechanic I’d like to have a dollar for every time I’ve heard “But…but…but it’s a (Fill in The Blank!) Why is this happening?”.
Any car you choose should go through a pre-purchase inspection and even after doing that there is no guarantee the car will be problem free. It swings the odds into your favor a bit.
You plan on driving 20k miles a year. Each one of those 20k miles is going to carry a maintenance cost with it; which means paying as you go along or fixing it all at once when things do go south.
There’s also the issue of how diligent you are going to be with oil changes, raising the hood to check all fluid levels, and so on. It does not take much neglect here to create major problems.
As for internet car complaints many of those should be taken with a grain of salt. Many are easy to read between the lines and the problem is what could be called “operator error”. Someone failing to check their motor oil level and losing an engine because of this needs to look in the mirror if they want to see whodunnit.

$50,000 car that’s depreciated to $8,000 is going to be much older and more used up than a $25,000 car that’s depreciated to $8,000.


Not at that age. The Avalon is a good deal cheaper than the ES, but the 15 year old ones are worth about the same at around the same mileage. And they’re both nice cars, so if OP wants Toyota or Lexus, they should get whichever one is in better condition.Well, a 2010 Camry XLE is $2000-$3000 cheaper than the ES, and just as reliable.OK, and the Yaris is even cheaper.  I was comparing like to like. The ES is a gussied up Avalon, not a Camry. You’ll pay the upcharge for getting an Avalon over the Camry. You won’t pay a “luxury” upcharge for getting the equivalent Lexus.It is a 96 camry with 238k miles it leaks oil, bad alternator, no ac and 3 bad engine mounts around 700 for repairs as I am in north San Diego county.
Total trash I kept it as a spare car because it was 1100 and drove. I drive a 05 Malibu with 220k miles it since 156k miles and I had to replace water pump twice, serpentine belt, 3 calipers, wheel hub, starter, tie rods, a rear shock and probably few more things.
Now I know about cars so I do most of the stuff myself I just paid for water pump, belt, starter and wheel hub because I didn’t have a spare car and needed to be at work or I didn’t wanna get in all that work.
Forgive my bad writing it is done on my phone.
I am not worried about scam I was just asking to make sure I am not ignoring real buyers.
I am selling the 96 for 1k now as I started from 1500 lowered it over the 2 weeks nobody really wanna buy it I guess because I am too honest in the description, lol. Can’t help that. Now there is a lot of buyers with this price.

336,Car shaking between the speed of 20 to 40 KM/H ONLY!,Maintenance/Repairs,10,2.9k,"I’m having a strange issue with my Hyundai Sonata 2011; that whenever I accelerate my car it goes fine from 0 to 20 KM/H but from 20 to 40 KM/H (or to be more precisely 30 to 40 KM/H) my car significantly shakes and after that everything goes fine. What could possibly the cause of this problem?
RegardsCommonly, this would be failing inner CV joint(s).Inner CV joint; means I’ve to change the complete axel or if just joint is available?Usually, replace both axles.If you have an automatic transmission, torque converter lock up problems can produce this symptom too.is this related to your humming sound issue? you accelerate up to the shift point so the revs drop after the trans shifts and lets the motor rpm drop. you have to have the throttle at 3/4 or above to make the motor rev beyond 3500 IF you have an auto trans. sure you could go to redline at every shift if you had a manual trans. some folks rev to 4000-5000 than shift cuz they like it. if you accelerate as is you have an egg under your right foot the motor will not rev over 3500.This issue has nothing to do with humming sound or high RPMs, my car shakes at the speed of 20 to 40 KM/H only, regardless of any RPM or shift number or road condition and yes I’ve auto trans. My car usually shifts at 2000 to 2500 RPMs and if I accelerate more it shifts at 3000 to 3500 RPMs or as according to how hard I accelerate, as I know it’s normal, but this shaking issue is regardless of any shift or RPM, car shakes at 20 to 40 KM/H no matter what condition is.
I will start by checking CV joints and will update here further.

If you do please do let me know


 Tayyab:

my car shakes at the speed of 20 to 40 KM/H only, regardless of any RPM


Does the steering wheel start to vibrate also?Check if your car is well balanced on all wheels, in that it is not leaning towards one side, get to a well leveled ground and measure the height through the center of the wheel from the floor to the car body above the wheel, make sure the height is the same on front wheels and same on back wheels else if your car is leaning towards one side it can cause this problem.People have been using different tires on the front and rear of vehicles for years so your advice does not really address the shaking problem .

337,Tuning a Nissan Transmission,General Discussion,54,1.4k,"I was looking into HPtuners as I would like to tune the TCM in my 2019 Nissan Frontier. But I noticed that they dont work for the transmission, only the engine. Does anyone know of a tuner for a Frontier’s TCM?Is your Nissan still under factory warranty?
If yes, do you understand that if you “tune” the transmission, doing so will void the factory warranty?
Just needed to throw that out there.Ok, thanks. Still Id like to knowDon’t do it, the CVT used by Nissan needs TLC, not tuning.  Change the fluid every 30,000 with Nissan factory fluid, and hope for the best.  And do nothing that puts your power train warranty at risk, that’s BIG $$$$.Ya? Well the thing is, My truck aint got a CVTYou’re right, must be one of the few Nissan’s with a regular AT.  That’s good.  But I stick by my advice.  Have you heard of any transmission tuner add ons?  I haven’t.I dont know what an add on is. You mean that Nissan transmissions dont have a programable TCM computer? They need an add on?I have not heard of ‘tuning’ a transmission’s TCM.  Have you?  What companies do this?  How?
And I’m talking about stock transmissions, not those sold by speed shops for SBCs, etc.I clearly know something that you dont. And thats that I dont know anything. What Im looking to do is reprogram the ECU to change the way my transmission behaves. HPtuners makes an adapter that connects to the ECU port and (i guess, Flashes it?) but it is then removed. Through the ECU, its changes the TCM, I guess because the TCM is governed by the ECU. I Am by no means well versed in this stuff.Something may exist, so far all I can find is an add of n that changes throttle response. I know what you’re looking for but haven’t found anything.Well, I appreciate it. Ive found what I want for other makes and models, but not for a Frontier.I presume you mean reprogramming the TCM. A quick web search turned up a TSB on programming a new TCM with the right equipment but nothing for reprogramming an existing TCM. Presumably a performance shop could do it but, like everyone else, I don’t recommend it for a vehicle that’s still under warranty. Out of curiosity, why do you want the transmission reprogrammed? If you genuinely hate the truck, I suggest you live with it until it’s financially feasible to replace it.

Don’t do anything until the warranty is expired.  And that thing you press with your right foot will change shift points or use the manual shift feature .
I can almost guarantee that you will spend money and not get the result you think you want.Thanks for all the advice. But let me explain myself clearly. I was wanting to Lower the shift points. I am a slow, easy driver and am not looking “Performance” like most people. I was wanting my truck to accomodate my “Ease along” mentality and not rev up so high. Also I wanted my TCC to lock up all the time after first gear. Most folks will say this limits power and acceleration. But for me it optimizes efficiency and does not require as much gas to accelerate. I find that I have more power in 5th than 4th because 4th does not lock-up and you have to give it a lot of gas to climb a hill, but fifth does it easily. Mostly my interest was simply in dabling with the ideaI don’t think you really understand how your vehicle works .  It is a truck and I have driven a Frontier and you seem to be looking for a problem where one does not exist .Good grief people. Stop giving me advice. I can form my own opinions and make my own decisions. If you arent going to answer my question Im not interested in what you have to say

Got AAA or similar? Battery issue my guess. How old is the battery? It takes more amps to start the car than to run the headlights etc.Checked the battery and it came back normal, it is actually fairly new. Do not have AAA unfortunately.If it’s like older fords, the bolt hole where the negative cable is grounded to the wheel well could be rusty and cleaning it up will help. I would look at the cable and change it if the insulation is cracked or change it without checking it. It could be poorly grounded between battery and engine.
To test for that, clamp jumper cable to the engine somewhere and Then to a fender bolt or the shock tower. Then  turn the key. On other cars there might be a ground cable from engine to firewall. I had a chevy that had one near the master cylinder. If it’s broken or has rusted ends, the car might never start.

It sounds like your starter is kaput.Things break on older vehicule like yours.After listening to the sound it seems the starter is running but the bendix which pushes the gear on the starter shaft into the ring gear of the engine isn’t working. It is just spinning. You might be able to fix the problem without getting another starter but it may be best just to replace it if it is the original starter due to the age of it. The problem also could be due to some tabs on the ring gear are broken off and the starter gear has nothing to engage against.The solonoid contacts could be worned…happens a lot on old starters. He might be able to replace the contacts for a few $$ intead of replacing the whole starter.

341,2001 Ford Focus front end work,Maintenance/Repairs,3,169,"01 Focus, front driver side lower control arm rusted through.  During the event the cv shaft was yanked apart as well.  Any suggestions as to what else I should replace while attempting this repair?  Tie rod comes to mind.  Anything else?  I’m ok with doing the work, but I’m not super familiar with this kind of work and I don’t want to have to disassemble things twice.
Wouldn’t mind an opinion on whether I should do other side as well - if this side is rusted through, how far off could the other side be?If your control arm rusted off, there is probably severe rust problems under there elsewhere. This would need a very close and thorough inspection. There’s a good likelyhood that the rust damage does not warrant repairs. Living in the snow and salt belt I know that chasing rust is like working on 100 year old plumbing. You never stop repairing until it has all been replaced. You might consider replacing this car.Replace both lower control arms. Check the condition of both cv shafts carefully. Wiggle the tie rod ends…if the more easily but are still not sloppy, leave them, they are easy to replace. Look carefully at the subrame cradle the suspension bolts to. Rusted subframes are a thing with these cars.Thanks guys. I’m going to get under it tomorrow and see if I can assess how bad it is and go from there. It’s my kids car and his pockets are not very deep so I’m hoping it’s salvageable.

342,Shake When Accelerating (35-45 mph),Maintenance/Repairs,5,130,"'08 Buick LaCrosse.
Vehicle shakes when hitting the gas between 35 and 45 mph. No shake when braking down through these speeds. No shake when in neutral revving the engine. No wheel shake as one would expect with warped rotors. Re-balanced and rotated the tires (they aren’t even that old anyway), still shakes. Below 35 mph, no shake. Vroom past 45 mph, buttery smooth.
Is this an alignment thing? Struts? What am I looking for? Salvage title car. No idea why. It was cheap and I use it for a rural mail route. Had the car for 40,000ish miles. Just the most recent issue in a long string of issues. I do as much of my own maintenance as possible to keep it profitable but this one is stumping me a bit.I’d guess a bad engine mount or three.That shake is caused by a worn inner CV joint.Given the salvage title I would check the alignment.Did a little more research. Seems like similar symptoms to a worn inner CV joint.I had it aligned a few months ago, so I’d kinda doubt that’s the entire issue. However, the routes I cover aren’t exactly forgiving as far as terrain goes and I get knocked around quite a bit.",,,,

Does anyone know what this could be and what I should try to fix it before calling the dealership? Thanks.cylinder misfire1064×1699 230 KBDoes the vehicle have to sit for a while when this hard starting occurs?
TesterThe misfires could be spark plugs, coil packs, fuel injectors, compression, bad gas, or something else.
What country are you in? There was no 2014 Matrix in the US as far as I can tell. Regardless, a 2014 is out of warranty so there is no need to take it to a dealer. An independent mechanic would most likely be cheaper.Yes it has to sit for the rough start to happen.I live in Canada. They made them one more year in 2014 here, but they are the exact same as the 2009-2013 model.The next time the vehicle sits and you go to start it, turn the ignition switch on so the dash lights come on for two seconds. and then turn the ignition switch off.
Repeat this a half dozen times and then try starting the engine.
If the engine starts right up without running rough, it points to a bad anti drain-back valve on the fuel pump assembly.
TesterI let the car sit for 10 hours and did the ignition switch thing like you instructed. It still struggled to start. Then once I drove it around and shut it off, it started up fine.I wonder if coolant is somehow getting into one or more cylinders.  I had this problem with a Ford Aerostar I once owned.  It would run roughly when first started after sitting overnight, but then would even out and run just fine.  The problem turned out to be a crack in a cylinder head.  Fortunately, the van was under warranty.  The dealer installed a new engine as enough coolant had leaked in to score a cylinder wall.",,,,
344,2017 Volkswagen Passat - Alignment,Maintenance/Repairs,11,456,"I have a 2017 VW Passat. I’m told it needs a 4-wheel alignment. The problem is, the dealer tells me this comes with a calibration of the adaptive cruise control, to the tune of $600 just for the calibration. What gives? Am I being taken for a ride? Why does wheel alignment generate a need for cruise control calibration?I checked a couple of VW forums on your behalf and unfortunately it’s true. However, you can always go to an alignment shop rather than the dealer and probably get a better price. Mind you, it will still be expensive but maybe not to the tune of $600.If your tires are not unevenly worn, and if the car goes straight down the highway, you are being scammed.

 GorehamJ:

3-year-old car needs an alignment? Bad design.


Not necessarily.
We don’t know whether the OP–or somebody else who drives the car–might have hit a curb, and we don’t know the condition of the roads in his area.   If the roads in his area are pockmarked with potholes, it is entirely possible for the alignment to be screwed-up.Without knowing what evidence leads to a needs-alignment diagnosis, we can’t be much help here. Are the tires worn unevenly? Did the car suffer an accident or curb strike? Does it “pull” to one side when you are driving? Did you recently buy new tires and an alignment was suggested?I appreciate the sentiment, but I was told that new tires = four-wheel alignment, along with a big bill. I decided to ignore all the noise and simply replace the tires. It’s fine and I’m $600 richer.Took 6 months to pull the trigger? Come back in 6 more months and report on tire wear. Or lack of.If there was abnormal tire wear before then your new tires are going to be showing signs of the same in the future.
An alignment on every new car is not a fixed in stone position; not even factoring in potholes, curbs, railroad tracks, and so on.I actually pulled that trigger right away. Just took me this long to answer here. I didn’t see any reason to do the alignment, so I didn’t. Tire wear is fine. Handling is fine.I see. Are you original owner? How many miles btw.Yep. I bought the car new. It’s my fourth VW (two Passats and two Jettas). The car has 75k miles on it now. I’ll drive VWs or Audis the rest of my days. I love them.

346,1500rpm Mysterious Vibration Hestitation,Maintenance/Repairs,7,167,"Hi All!!
Im new to this forum. I hope youre all doing well during these crazy times. What a year. Anyways…
So I just bought a 2011 Toyota Camry LE 2.5L L4
A little over 158,000 miles. The car drivers great with the exception of this one little problem.
Between 1500-2000 rpms the car will vibrate/hesitate intermittently. This only happens when the car is at operating temperature and accelerating. It does not happen while coasting. This problem does NOT happen on a cold start and drive. Only when the engine reaches operating temperature.
The problem also does NOT happen above 50mph/2000rpm. Above that speed… the car runs super smooth.
So far I have only put in new spark plugs, premium 93 gas and fuel injection cleaner in the tank.
No check engine light, no other dash warning lights. Had a friend do a live read of the car while driving. His scanner was all green on every sensor and measurement. The vibration caused a P0301 code only once!! Cleared it. Couldnt get the code to happen again. Tried a different coil on the 1st spark plug, same problem.
Cant figure out why the car is hesitating. If any of you have seen this mystery before or have any clue as to what it might be, your input will be greatly apreciated. Otherwise I will have to surrender it to a shop and lose hundreds of dollars.Have someone try cleaning the electronic throttle body.

I have heard people recommending high-octane gas for cars that don’t actually require it since I was a kid, and that’s… a very long time.  That advice was invalid then, and it remains just as invalid today.
At one time, high-octane gas might have had a higher level of detergents than regular-grade gas, but nowadays simply using regular-grade Top Tier gas will provide the highest level of detergents available.    If the OP doesn’t know which gasoline brands meet the Top Tier standard, here is a link:

My question is is this valve either an open or closed valve, or is it contimously adjusting the air the air flow?This video explains the function of the heated air intake system.
air intake heating
TesterI think the OP is referring to the emissions air injection (or smog pump) system.
From the manual:
When the engine is cold or in wide open throttle condition, the ECM energizes the solenoid on the valve and air is directed to the exhaust manifold ports. When the coolant temperature increases, the solenoid is de-energized and air goes into the air cleaner which also acts as a silencer. At higher engine speeds, air is directed to the air cleaner through the pressure relief valve even though the solenoid may be energized.
There should be no air going to the exhaust ports while operating in the ""Closed Loop” mode.
During engine decel, when there is a rise in the manifold vacuum signal, air is directed to the air
cleaner.
What the OP is describing appears to be normal (note bold emphasis above, added by me). This can be checked by removing the air hose from the air cleaner and noting the air flow when the engine is started (at full operating temp). Air should flow to the exhaust ports for about five seconds, then flow should switch to the air cleaner.",,,,

350,Ignition and Security Warnings in ‘04 Chevy Impala,Maintenance/Repairs,12,45.5k,"A year ago, I had a problem starting my car (a 2004 Chevrolet Impala, about 120,000 miles).  When I put the key in the ignition, the engine wouldn’t turn.  I knew there wasn’t a problem with the battery because my lights, radio, etc. were still operating fine.  Instead, I got a bright flashing “SECURITY” message on the front panel of the car.  After a few minutes pacing around the parking lot, I returned to my car and it started without a problem.  I checked online, and several car forums and articles claimed that this was a common problem in 2004 Chevrolet Impalas: some faulty wiring in the security system would stop the car from turning on because it thought you were trying to hot-wire the vehicle.
After the first incident, I didn’t encounter this problem again until recently.  Within the last 2 weeks, this problem has become more frequent, occurring maybe 2-3 times per week.  The car won’t start and I’ll get a flashing “SECURITY” message.  If I wait a while (between 5 to 30 minutes), the car will eventually start.
I finally decided to take my car into a Chevrolet dealership to get the problem fixed.  I described the problem to the mechanic; she guessed that the cause was associated with the ignition cylinder, and said that it would cost a minimum of $750 to fix ($100 to check for the problem, $650 to replace the cylinder).
I’m only a college student, and this is more than half my paycheck for an entire month (ouch!!).  Before taking out a loan to pay for this, I thought I’d try to solicit some second opinions.  Is anyone familiar with this problem?  Is the problem associated with wiring or the ignition cylinder?  Is there any way to haggle the price down from $750?For future reference…Just because your lights and radio work…a non-start problem could still be the battery. Starting a car requires HUNDREDS of amps…while running the lights and radio only require MAYBE 20 amps.
But I don’t think this is a battery problem because you’re able to start it after a little while. Batteries don’t fix themselves.
Sounds like the car has a built in Security system. It could be this or it could also be the ignition.
It’s difficult to diagnose a problem like this over the internet. Instead of going to the dealer…find a good independent…should be cheaper. There might even be one in your area that specializes electrical problems.Google PASSLOCK and find hours of reading enjoyment (assuming you enjoy poking sticks in your eye;). I’ve fixed dozens of GM security issues from the early days of VATS to the PASSLOCK II system. You can fix or even bypass it for much cheaper than the dealer quoted. Since you’re young, in school and looking for a frugal repair, here’s one example to get you started- http://chevroletforum.com/forum/impala-14/finally-cheap-passlock-fix-21877/page3/ 6.1kThe OP says the engine doesn’t turn…does that mean turn, as in crank, or turn over? I don’t own anything with Passlock but I thought the system shut off the fuel pump on offending attempts to start the vehicle…shouldn’t the car crank and run for a couple of seconds and shut off?Lots of people describe cranking but not starting as won’t ‘turn on’. Later, he says ‘won’t start’ so I believe it probably is cranking but not starting.
The key point is the security indication on the dash display. That only happens when the system detects a fault.
I have never seen a GM PASSLOCK vehicle start even momentarily when a security issue is indicated on the dash.Weird there is no edit icon in the mobile version…
I meant to also say that the ECM inhibits more than the pump. The injector pulses and ignition are also disabled. It wouldn’t be hard to defeat if all you had to bypass was the pump and those other functions are easy to include making it much harder to bypass by hot wiring.TThis happened to my daughter’s 2007 Impala… Including the SECURITY message on the display.  A new battery fixed the problem.  While that may not be your problem, it’s an inexpensive place to start.Turn your ignition to the on position.  Wait until the Security light stops flashing. (About 5 mins ) then turn back to off. Then try starting. This always works for my 2004 Chevy Impala. This is what I am doing at this moment. And YES. It just started! Works every time. Good luck!6 years late , Dan.

351,Car shake violently at traffic light,Maintenance/Repairs,19,23.7k,"1991 Honda Civic, automatic transmission, the car/steering wheel shake badly when the car stops at the red light. It only happens when brake pedal is pressed AND in D gear. If shift from D to N, the shake disappears. As soon as the traffic light turns green and the car starts to accelerate, the shake disappears. Four spark plugs were replaced, no effect at all. Thanks for your help.You have a failed motor mount.  Pretty cheap repair for your car, maybe $100 max.Thanks for the reply. If engine mount is bad, shouldn’t the car shake all the time. It only shakes when stops in traffic light and only in gear. Shifting to neutral then shake is gone.kizwiki’s guess is certainly possible but it is just a guess.
What you have to wrap your head around is that putting the car in gear puts load on the drivetrain.  It is that load that is leading to the shaking.
This might happen because of a bad motor mount.
It will also happen for 100 other reasons that no one can guess about because you haven’t said anything else about the car.  Most of these reasons have to do with simple things like spark plugs - so now that you’ve gotten that far do the rest.  New wires, new air and fuel filters.  A check for vacuum leaks and a check of the fuel pressure would be in order.
Basically, rather than guessing first at a motor mount I’d guess first at your car not running right.I guess it might be to do with the fuel system and idle speed because when the traffic light turns green, I apply the gas pedal (it certainly puts load on the drivetrain) then the shake is gone and the engine is quiet. Perhaps not enough air/fuel mix at idle while in gear (load on engine) causes the shake?Something wrong with the air/fuel mix (thus do air & fuel filters, check fuel pressure and for vacuum leaks) or something wrong with spark (thus have a look at the spark plug wires).  But a look at the motor mounts is also in order.  If nothing turns up there then you move on to other things (like distributor/coil, EGR system…)
Is the check engine light on?The check engine light was one a few times duel to misfire (I guess since Autozone can’t read code for older cars). After I replaced the spark plugs, the engine light was still on a few times. After I pour some fuel injector cleaning liquid to gas tank, the light is no longer on anymore so far. This engine light problem was only in the past few months. However, I don’t feel it is related to the engine shake because this shake problem has been there for many years. Air filter was replaced and is clean. I didn’t check fuel filter recently but it was replaced in 2003 and I think should be fine as well. Well, the problem is I really don’t want to put more money in this old car so as long as it runs fine I guess this minor shake issue is tolerable to me. I was just puzzled/curious what causes the problems though.The mounts can be diagnosed using a floor jack. Have an assistant run car in gear with foot on brake. Use floor jack to jack engine up slightly to get the weight off the mount. If this helps, then it’s a mount.Is There An Alternate Route That You Can Take That Has Stop Signs And Not Red Lights ?
("" . . . the car/steering wheel shake badly when the car stops at the red light."") 
CSAIs that a joke?The car would not shake during normal idle when the car is in neutral or park with one bad mount.  But, the engine would visibly move when revved in neutral.  You can have someone rev the engine while you are looking at the engine.  See if it doesn’t move a few inches or more while the engine is revved, in neutral, drive and reverse.
It’s true there are more than a few reason why your car will shake in drive at a red light but will be smooth in idle.  But you didn’t mention very low idle or stalling while in drive at red lights.  Does the car also stall at red lights in drive?  Is the idle very low?
There aren’t hundreds of reasons why your car will shake violently in drive when stopped but will not shake at all in neutral. There are very few reasons that will not effect idle and will not cause the car to stall in drive while stopped.You are right.  But I’d expect the car to stall occasionally or frequently at red lights for most other reasons.Idle dropping slightly too low when in gear? That could cause a problem like this also.
There are some other possibilities but I’d want to know about the idle speed first.
Since this problem has gone on for years with the CEL involved it could also be due to something more serious; say a cylinder going down on compression.Since the car only shakes when it comes to a COMPLETE stop with brake and in D gear, and it is an automatic transmission, could the problem be “torque converter”??!!
I can feel that I had to press brake very hard in order to keep the car from moving.Did you ever find out what the problem was? I’m having this exact same problem even having the brake be harder to press.While your mystery vehicle might also have a broken motor mount, I suggest that you have your mechanic check for a failing power brake booster.   A vacuum leak at that booster could cause the engine to idle very roughly, and reduced vacuum in the booster would definitely lead to more effort being needed to apply the brakes.

354,Pressure Gauge Calibration,Maintenance/Repairs,16,373,"I check my tires weekly, using a digital pressure gauge. Here’s the problem: I recently got a new gauge and it reads about 10% different than my old one. One (or both) of these gauges is wrong. Anyone know how to calibrate a tire pressure gauge? I work in a place where most of our high-accuracy, high-precision devices are sent out to a NIST-certified lab for cal. I don’t want that kind of expense, just want to know if my gauge is OK.If you don’t have the calibration tool, which NIST labs do, the only way is to compare against a known good gauge. There is likely no way to adjust your new digital gauge, though.Similar to what I posted in another thread:
Carry a box of donuts to a shop and ask to compare your gauges to one or two of their best gauges.
What I do when I have a device that’s off by a known amount, and not practical to adjust, is put on a label with the correction factor.
For instance, I have a pencil gauge I keep in my glove compartment.
I have a label on it (made with a Brother P-Touch) that says “add 2”, so I know to add 2 psi to its reading.
I have a digital gauge (Radio Shack!) that agrees with the TPMS in the car, so I have high confidence in those.
That gauge only comes off the shelf to do comparisons a couple times a year.
Then, most of my tire checking is done with an Accu-Gage dial gauge that has drifted 3 psi over many years of being bumped about.
I could get a tool to pop off and re-seat the needle, but it’s not worth the bother IMHO.You could compare against the gauges of your family and friends to get a better idea of which one is more likely to be correct.
I’ve heard that the analog dial-type gauges tend to be the most accurate, for what it’s worth. I have three such Accu-Gage gauges that all agree.I use a bourdon tube tire pressure gauge.

It’s the most accurate tire gauge one can use, as long as it’s not dropped.
TesterThanks, Tester. But, how do you KNOW it’s accurate?Send it in and get it cal/certed is the only way.
Or, compare it to a gauge that’s been cal/certed.
TesterLets see , how simple would it be to go to a tire store and have them set all four tires to the correct pressure.  Then use the new tire gauge and see what it says .  Most tire stores around here don’t even charge for that . I do give the person who does it it a dollar so he can buy a soft drink . May need to be 2 dollars next time as prices are going up .


 VOLVO-V70:

I’ve used it over the years a few times to check tires of family, friends etc. when out and about.
It’s not accurate, but repeatable, so I labeled it with how much it’s off.
It’s there “just in case”, better than nothing, don’t care if it gets rough handling.I had a high pressure pencil gauge for my bicycle tires that may have been inaccurate.  I had a first floor office and there was a bike rack outside our windows.  I had ridden my bicycle to work that day as I was doing in the summer.  At any rate, we thought we heard a gun shot.  A colleague called the campus police and they found nothing.  When I got ready to ride my bike home, I found the rear tire had blown out.  Apparently, I had overinflated the tire because the gauge read low and the hot weather caused the pressure to increase.“Tester” has shown a picture of an analog gauge. On it is written its calibration standard:
ANSI 40.1 Grade B.  The following is that standard:
“Answer: All Accu-Gage dial tire gauges are ANSI Commercial Grade B gauges (meet ANSI B40 . 1 Grade B specifications), which means that the mechanical accuracy rating is ± 2% from 30% to 60% of scale and ± 3% below 30% and above 60%.”
Of course, this calibration applies to a new unit, so treat your gauge nicely.  Thus, a cross-calibration with such a unit would be useful, but won’t be any more accurate than the Accu-gauge. Ideally the Accu-gauge should be purchased with a careful choice of scales so that, your cross-calibration is in its mid-range.
I can’t imagine anything worse than trusting either a pencil gauge or a TPMS.  The pencil gauge is even touchy for getting repeated readings, let alone when the slider gets a little dirty.
Finally, consider the range of temperatures and pressures that the tire experiences on a long hot drive or a short cold day.  2% is probably not needed.  However, I do think this is an important question, because if you set your tire pressure 5% low and then don’t check it for another year, or only if your TPMS goes off, you might be in trouble. (Mine goes off at 22 PSI…that is, according to my gauge.Just because it’s a digital readout does NOT mean it’s accurate. The standard pencil gauge can be made extremely accurate. It’s not rocket science. In fact it’s pretty simple. Some are built better then others, but the cheap ones can be just as accurate.Honestly as long as it’s in the ballpark, you’re OK. Unless you’re doing top-speed runs at the salt flats in a rocket car, you really don’t need overly precise pressures in the tires. Within a pound or two is fine.You can read all about this:

355,Avg. fuel number reads drastically different when I pick up my car from repairs,Maintenance/Repairs,8,305,"I took my vehicle in for repairs after some front end damage from hitting a flying piece of plywood on the highway. The average fuel economy was posted at 18.4 before repairs. The day I pick up my vehicle from the shop it now reads 13.4 average. Thoughts?The battery was disconnected while being repaired and the average was reset to zero. Moving the car in the parking lot boosted the reading to 13.4.
Drive it normally, the average will come back up.Whenever I pick up my car after servicing, the mpg readout inevitably reads ~2 mpg less than when I brought it in.   When you take idling in the shop and also moving the car around on the shop’s premises into account, and then throw-in their post-service test drive that is undoubtedly not done with an eye toward good gas mileage, that inevitably leads to a drop in the average mpg reading.
The next time that I fill the tank and re-set the system, my mpg readout always returns to my usual/normal numbers, and–more than likely–the OP will have the same experience.Measure your fuel economy “manually”.
Note you car’s mileage the next time you fill up with gas. At your next fill up, note the number of gallons to fill up the tank, and the mileage. Calculate the difference in mileage, and divide by the number of gallons of gas. Do that several times over a few weeks, and that will give you an actual MPG figure.I’d hit the reset button and start over on the average.Shops like to reset things like this for some reason and shut everything off or they disconnected the battery.  In either case, looking at the average over a long period of time is really not very meaningful.  Going downhill you might get 50 mpg and stop at a stop light down to zero so on the average you might be at 30 so how is that useful?  I usually just reset the thing on the highway to get an idea of highway mileage and pretty much ignore city and overall average.  You have to understand what average means-time and miles traveled.On both my Mustang and F-150. There are two separate trip odometer readouts , each one gives you time in hours/minutes/seconds since you last reset it, the distance covered since you last reset it, and the average MPG since the last reset.  I reset one when I took delivery of each vehicle and have never touched it since . The other one I reset at each fill up.  My thinking is that if I ever have a suspicious drop in fuel economy, I can compare it to the historical average at will, and then figure out what’s causing it (recent driving trends, etc.).


 FoDaddy:

I reset one when I took delivery of each vehicle and have never touched it since . The other one I reset at each fill up.


That’s the A and B trip meter on my car.  On a trip I usually use the A for the total trip out and back and the B for each way.  Like I said, I see no reason to accumulate a lifetime mpg and hours of driving figure and I do a lot of top offs and various driving patterns which makes tank comparisons not valuable information.  But to each his own.Old habits die hard with me.  My first cars had neither trip odometers nor mpg readouts.  I had a little freebie from my insurance agent that clipped on the sun visor.  It had five dials that I set to the odometer reading when I bought gasoline.  The next time I bought gas, I would mentally subtract the reading on the 25¢ gizmo from the insurance company from the odometer reading.  I would round off the number of gallons it took to fill the gas tank and do a little adjustment of the miles traveled and mentally do the division.  This was all the accuracy I needed to compute the mpg.",,,,

357,2011 Toyota Tundra - Manual downshifting,Maintenance/Repairs,8,388,"Hi Ray, I’m hoping you can settle an argument I’m having with a fishing buddy.  When I’m driving my Tundra in the mountains, particularly when I’m pulling my boat, I often go into manual override mode to downshift.  I do this when going downhill, when I’m slowing down to take a turn, or maybe when I miss the manual transmission of my old Dodge Powerwagon.  To that my friend always says “brakes are cheaper than transmissions” or something to that effect.  I also do this with my Lexus is 350.  I say the vehicle is made for this and I’m doing no damage.  Please settle this for me, so I can focus our arguments on who caught the biggest fish!If Ray posts here it’s under an alt. I’m not even sure he reads our posts. That said, Ray has answered this question in the past and he agreed with your buddy.


 BillinColorado:

my friend always says “brakes are cheaper than transmissions” or something to that effect.


That is a foolish statement, it suggests that your friend knows little about automobiles. Transmissions don’t use friction to slow the vehicle, it is the action of engine braking that slows the vehicle. There is less of a load on a transmission while engine braking than while accelerating. The transmission will not burn-up the way your brakes will.
Brakes rely of friction, brake pad wear multiplies with high heat and overheating the brakes causes the rotors to warp. Some of my customers warp their brake rotors each time they drive in the mountains because they don’t understand the need to downshift.



 BillinColorado:

I also do this with my Lexus is 350.


Lexus would not have mounted paddle shifters on the steering wheel if shifting were to cause damage to the transmission.

I find it interesting that Ray’s advice apparently changes with circumstances. In an installment of the newspaper column a few years ago he wrote that downshifting creates internal wear on the transmission and it’s preferable to use the brakes because any potential repair is cheaper. On the subject of paddle shifters in the same column, he wrote that vehicles are equipped with them because buyers think they’re cool but they shouldn’t actually be used.

I have been driving for  55 years, and I have always downshifted my automatic transmission on steep downgrades.   And, I have never had to overhaul or replace a transmission on any of my vehicles.Relying solely on the brakes on steep grades while towing can cause the brakes to overheat and fail.OP is driving a 9 year old truck and towing heavy loads, He does not report any transmission problems.  His friend is offering advice, but it’s the OP’s truck and he decides.  What he is doing is good, careful driving, and well within the design limits of his truck.  Laying guilt on him for being careful is just nonsense, and his fishing buddy should be told to stop nagging about something that’s not his concern.I had to give my sister-in-law a quick and urgent downshifting tutorial coming down a mountain pass, in a minivan full of people, when the brakes started to groan and shudder.
I’m not normally a back seat driver, but I had to speak up.Bill has not posted since the 15th but the part about slowing for a turn makes me think that he might be doing the electronic shifting when there is no real benefit .

It sounds like the inner CV joint is rotating but the axle shaft is not.
With the engine off, the transmission in park, have someone hold the right side tire from rotating, rotate the left side tire and look for the broken joint (the boot will be ripped apart and the axle shaft will rotate but not the joint).

All too many people seem to assume that a lit-up CEL is a normal situation.
Unfortunately, it portends a problem, and some of those problems can be very serious, in terms of how much they will cost for repair.   Until you get the stored trouble codes “read” nobody could possibly tell you how serious a problem you might have.



 Jes-320:

This is usually indicative a slipping transmission, but you need to have the trouble codes read, and I think that a visit to a transmission specialist is in your future.   Just be sure that you don’t go to Lee Myles, Cottman, Mr. Transmission, or AAMCO, unless you want to be told that you need a new/overhauled transmission, even if only a less expensive repair is needed.

Regardless of the odometer mileage, after 8 years some cars will develop rust under the paint–some more than others.  The last Chevy that I owned developed this problem after ~4 years.If you don’t wax the car  once or twice a year then they will be more prone to this type thing .I don’t believe that wax will prevent a paint delamination problem, it is a defect with the primer or E-coat material or application.Windshield washer? Front of car? Trunk. Rear of car? Ah, rear window washer? Do Kia Rios have rear washers?Since Kilometers are involved I assume, right or wrong, that Canada may be involved in this. That means snow, salt, and rust. Could be rust caused, problem with the factory paint, or poor paintwork from a previous repair which may be unknown to you if you bought the car used.

366,Is it normal to have to change each headlight about 6 months apart consistently?,Maintenance/Repairs,33,858,"I’ve had a 2008 Santa Fe for five years now and it’s been pretty much on the dot that I one headlight goes out and six months later, the other goes. Except it’s continuous over the life I’ve had the car. So basically every six months I’m replacing a headlight. Bad wiring?Modern manufacturing has been pretty much able to determine the life span of many products.  So light bulbs are rated for so many hours of use like 1000 hours.  There are deviations of course but generally when one burns out, it won’t be too long before the other goes.  That’s their life span.  So I always replace both when one goes out.
Now six months is a little early depending on how much the lights are used.  I was replacing mine at about one year until I discovered one of the sockets was a little burned.  It’s been about two years now.  So I’d recommend having the sockets looked at the next time.  They can be replaced or sometimes bending the prongs a little can provide better contact.  It would make sense to actually test the bulb to see if it is really burned out or not if you have an ohm meter.  ($10 at Harbor Freight for a cheap Chinese knock off)


 Bing:

l I discovered one of the sockets was a little burned


This is EXTREMELY common with GM vehiclesYou don’t handle the bulbs with your bare hands, do you?
Because doing so leaves oil from your skin on the surface of the bulbs, causing hot spots which causes the bulb to fail prematurely.

Why Do Headlights Go Bad When You Touch Them? 1
Even the cleanest hands are dirty things -- at least as far as your headlight bulbs are concerned. Mother Nature may have seen fit to enhance your paws with a few essential oils, but your headlights definitely won't appreciate them.

My Corolla is of similar vintage, a 2009, and takes a similar type of bulb, and I haven’t replaced a headlight bulb in years. The problem might be due to touching the bulbs with bare hands but frankly I doubt it.

However, the other unknown factor is how much night driving the OP does.
No, headlight bulbs shouldn’t burn out in 6 months, but that type of replacement frequency is at least a bit more understandable if someone does a lot of night driving.
I rarely drive at night, and that probably accounts for not needing to replace one of headlight bulbs on my current vehicle until it hit the 10 year mark.  The other one is still working, after close to 11 years.Also depends on if your particular vehicle  uses the headlights as DRL’s also .  This will shorten the life .  That being said it has been many years  since I have replaced a headlight .
i have a 2008  car and it still uses the original headlights.  I have replaced  1 taillight  on this vehicle .


 VDCdriver:

No, headlight bulbs shouldn’t burn out in 6 months,


The way I read the OP,
The left headlight burns out once a year, possibly every November
The right headlight burns out once a year, possibly every May
And as @VDCdriver questions, how much night driving is being done
Also does this car have daytime running lights?You can wear gloves if you must touch the bulb to install it. Just make sure you don’t get body oils in the glove’s fingers. Also, use electrical contact grease to prevent oxidation of the contacts.I always have my headlights on, not just the DRL’s.  I rarely have to replace any bulb.  Probably 4 years+ since I replaced a headlight bulb.  I am very careful to not touch the bulb.When one goes out I replace them in pairs. Bulb life expactancy in hours is listed on the package. I went with dumbed down bulbs as DRL kept them on all the time.If you are using “brighter” bulbs, they do not last as long.  If you read the back of some of those bright bulbs, they list the life of the bulb as 200 hours down to 100 hours for the brightest.  1000 hours is the typical lifespan of an OEM bulb.Excessive ripple voltage or high charging voltage from the alternator can cause shorter than normal bulb life. If the max DC voltage at the battery is less than 15 volts you should be okay with that. I have had very good bulb life with lights from Phillips. They were OEM equipment in my van.My Corolla has DRLs and it’s still been years since I’ve had to replace a headlight bulb. I’m not sure how much that has to do with it.This is not normal.  I have never needed to replace a brake light, turn signal light, or headlight bulb with less than 5 years or 50,000 miles on it.  There must be some external cause, unless you are buying super-cheap no-name bulbs online?
To put this into perspective, my 2004 Corolla has about 109,000 miles, owned it since new, and the only bulbs I ever had to change were the license plate lights and one brake light.  My 2002 Daewoo Lanos probably still has all its original bulbs.  I replaced all of the headlight, parking light, brake light, turn signal light, and license plate light bulbs on my 2000 Silverado since it came with 209,000 miles on it.  Most of the bulbs were original based on their date codes.


 Barkydog:

When one goes out I replace them in pairs.


In my 45+ years of owning vehicles I’ve NEVER replaced them in pairs. And never regretted it. I replaced one headlight on my 98 Pathfinder and then replaced the other 5 years later. I usually get 2+ years out of the other bulb.
Maybe it’s the vehicles we buy, but headlight replacement is very rare. 1 every 5-7 years at most. Other lights are even rarer. I don’t remember the last time I had to replace a tail light bulb or one of the marker bulbs. And now with LED’s it’s really rare.Cougar said “Excessive ripple voltage or high charging voltage from the alternator can cause shorter than normal bulb life.”
I wondered about that – could adding a little extra “DC power” from high charge voltage or add ing some “AC power” from RMS of the ripple waveform really shorten the bulb life?
A little Google research confirmed his assertion.  A voltage increase of only 5% (power increase of 11%) can reduce incandescent bulb life by half.  Here is the pertinent page from one useful and interesting website :


lamptech.co.uk 2



Voltage Variation Effects 2





I think it’s simple enough to understand how a faulty regulator could increase the charging voltage on the battery.  But what would cause “excessive” (whatever that is) ripple? I thought the battery was supposed to smooth the rectified 3-phase AC from the alternator.  So, is a bad battery the cause of excessive ripple?A bad diode in the alternator can cause ripple.

Bad Body Control Module? Here's How to Tell
Dealing with strange lights, sounds and other problems? Here's how to diagnose a bad body control module before it sidelines your vehicle.

A good independent mechanic’s shop should be able to correctly diagnose the problem, and to replace the BCM, if that is necessary.   Just stay away from chain-run places like Midas, Meineke, Monro, Sears, Pep Boys, and–worst of all–AAMCO.recheck the battery connections.  Door ding, blinker noise, and radio all go through the radio.  I had a 2010 Chevy loose all that, and when I cleaned the battery connections all was fine.
hopefully it is an easy fix.
and if your 2016 is out of warranty, then there is zero need to go tot he dealer.  find a good independent shop to use.Here’s what can happen when a battery goes dead or is disconnected on some vehicles.
It resets the Body Control Module (BCM). Like the Climate Control module, the BCM may not resume normal operation until it has undergone a special relearn procedure or is reprogrammed with a factory scan tool. This can mess up the operation of power accessories such as power windows, memory seats, power sunroof, or electronic suspension settings. Worse yet, the BCM is the “gate keeper” module on many 2003 and newer vehicles that have a CAN (Controller Area Network) system. If the BCM cannot communicate properly with all of the other modules, or it does not recognize the addresses of other modules, it can cause all kinds of problems.

This problem may have occurred as a result of the jump start. Jump cables connected to another car’s battery can cause a power spike that can damage the electronics in your car, like the body control module. The spike might also damage the radio unit. A lot of functions are contained in the same electronic module the radio is in. You need a shop versed in auto electronics to sort this out.Does the radio turn on? Any message on its display?

368,Wanted: A normal car if they still make them,Buying/Selling,52,1.8k,"I am looking for a new vehicle and I am concerned that “normal” vehicles are not made anymore.
I want a real manual transmission, no auto start/stop, no AWD.
Prefer a pick up, but a SUV/hatchback would work.The internet knows all.Toyota Tacoma SR5 comes close. V6 manual pickup, but I think it has stop/start.
Do your own internet search… in this order…start with all cars with a manual transmission for 2021. That is a small list and it is here:
https://www.motortrend.com/features-collections/every-manual-transmission-car-for-sale/ 6
Find the vehicle that is close and search their manufacturer’s website for stop/start features. AWD is usually an option so that that one is easy. Stop/start won’t be. Most can be disabled with the push of a button every time you drive but not permanently.
Not sure why you’d want a manual except for fun. They get lower fuel economy than autos these days.
Keep in mind any of these cars are going to have a dozen computers on-board no mater what trans they have.Thanks for the response. I have been doing what you suggested, just was hoping for a short cut.
The reason I want a MT only is because I had two pickups that I drove a little over 400,000 miles each and my total cost for transmission maintenance and repairs on them was zero. No one has ever made a AT that will go over 400,000 miles without any cost. One $3,000 repair bill on the AT wipes out everything saved by a couple of MPG’s. I have owned several other cars with MT’s besides the two pickups, and still my total repair/maintenance for all manual AT’s since 1985 is zero.

So you never replaced a clutch on either truck in 400,000 miles?Some people have mastered the art of not abusing clutches and it’s clutch abuse that gives manuals a bad name.No, I honestly never did. The first vehicle was a 1985 Nissan pickup, and the 2nd was a 1991 Nissan pickup, bought both new. This is why I want a MT, to get the same life. Nissan has gone to a nine-speed AT only.

400,000 miles in 6 years ?
That would have to be almost all highway miles, very little clutch use doing that.Perhaps both were owned concurrently for several years after 1991

Fuel economy and the requirements cars have to meet isn’t about saving money. It’s about saving gas. I’m not saying it’s right, just that that’s the way it is.Saving gas? ICE has no future. Waste of time.That does sound like the ultimate in “ideal driving conditions.”No problem.  All you have to do is change your definition of “new” to mean “15-20 years old, but in good condition” and you will have plenty to choose from.  Also, the reason people want an automatic transmission has nothing to do with fuel economy or efficiency.  People want them because it is much easier and more pleasant to drive an automatic.  And with proper care, it is not unreasonable to expect an automatic transmission to last for 250,000 miles.Or a Nissan frontier up to 2019, Chevy Colorado dropped the manual around the same time.Wanting a manual means that some very nice vehicles will be left of the list of choices .
I really wonder if two different vehicles each made 400000 miles on the original clutch or if that number was for both of them  .   400000 in 6 years is 66000 miles a year .


 Mustangman:

So you never replaced a clutch on either truck in 400,000 miles?


I have 150k on my clutch in the MR2 at the moment. And I suspect I’ll be replacing it early because the rear main seal is due to go out, and I might as well as long as the transmission’s off anyway. Otherwise it’d probably last a lot longer. But unless I’m driving enthusiastically, I only use the clutch to get it rolling in 1st.You remind me of a friend of mine who went to buy a new car after many years of not doing so. He went to a Subaru dealer and a salesperson was demonstrating the various models on the floor. He gets to the infotainment system and my friend says"" I don’t want any of that, just a radio with an on/off/volume knob, a tuning knob, and buttons for presets"". Salesperson says “if I had a car like that in inventory, I wouldn’t sell it, I’d donate it to a museum. Now please excuse me while I go wait on someone who might actually be interested in buying a car”.Co-worker asked the Nissan sales manager about a manual Sentra a few years aggo and was told he could order one but the last one they had took at least 6mo to sell.20 years ago, cars like that were EVERYWHERE.  You could have gone to a dealer selling any non-luxury brand, and they’d have several models in stock with those excellent features.  Remember that as late as 1998 you could get a Toyota Camry with no power options, and as late as 2000 you could get a Honda Accord like that.  As late as 2005, you could get a Dodge Neon with hand crank windows and just an AM/FM stereo.

369,2013 Camaro Brake Squeal,Maintenance/Repairs,10,271,"My 2013 Camaro Brakes have been squealing for about a year. It only happens when they’re like 30%-70% compressed. I changed the pads and rotors a few months ago, and the squealing continued.
Mechanic told me the pins and hardware were gummed up and needed cleaning/greasing. Paid $270 for it, and the squealing didn’t stop. The mechanic then told me it’s because I have discount pads (Detroit axle) and replacing them and turning the rotors would fix it. $180 would be the cost, but I don’t know if I trust him.
My uncle says they’re wrong and it’s probably a rear suspension issue. I’m inclined to believe him because why would I get the same screech before and after I changed the pads?
Any advice is greatly appreciated!You know you had oem GM pads ? and they squeaked? And new budget stuff squeaks? I don’t see the connection.


 Brandon-77:

I changed the pads and rotors a few months ago, and the squealing continued


Front, rear or both?  What brakes do you have? Brembo? Is this a 6 cylinder or a performance V8?



 Brandon-77:

Ok, stop taking your car there, this person isn’t very good.



 Brandon-77:

My uncle says they’re wrong and it’s probably a rear suspension issue.


Why does he say this? Is the noise from the rear? Or from the front?
You need to tell us more info. Post back with answers and we’ll try and help.Replaced both front and back, Detroit axle disk brakes, V6.
when my uncle rode with me, we couldn’t hear any squealing. I believe He thinks the added weight means the suspension doesn’t go down as much when the car brakes. He also helped me change the pads and rotors, we greased things thoroughly and he recommended the pads/rotors to me cuz they were a good deal and hes used them.
He told me to push on the back of the car to see if it would make the noise, but it didn’t.
I thought the noise was from the rear drivers tire, but the mechanic said he thought it was drivers front. It’s definitely on the drivers side tho.I can’t see how the suspension could cause brake squeal. 
Are all the clips on the pads present and accounted for? You might want to try applying anti-squeal compound to the back of the pads.


 Brandon-77:

I believe He thinks the added weight means the suspension doesn’t go down as much when the car brakes


That’s not correct and the suspension wouldn’t be squealing unless something was actually rubbing and clearly that’s not the case.
Some cars are more susceptible to squeal that others and some brands are more likely to squeal. The squeal is annoying but won’t hurt the ability of the car to stop. The Detroit pads are ceramics as are most of the pads offered for this car. They are generally quieter than metallic pads.
Agree with @NYBo, a little brake grease on the back of the pads may help.
If you just have to have them quiet, switching pads to a different brand may fix the problem but you don’t have to replace the rotors as they are nearly new. I’d suggest ACDelco or Bosch ceramic pads.Yes everything looked fine. I didn’t put any of the spray but both I and allegedly the mechanic greased everything, so that should be sufficient?
Just seems weird that they would squeal before and after installation of the new pads and rotors.


 Brandon-77:

Did you or your mechanic put anything on the back of the pads? Are the anti-rattle clips new and properly installed?Gotcha. Like I said, I just thought it probably wasn’t the pads if the same squealing was happening with the original pads.
I’ll probably just live with it, only noticeable with the windows down. But if you think of anything else I can check out, lemme know.
Forgot to mention but my car has a messed up speed sensor or maybe a bearing, which caused the abs to flicker and made a grinding noise. I took the abs chip out, so there’s no abs brakes or grinding anymore. After I took out the chip, the power braking in the car doesn’t work for the first 20-30 seconds after ignition.
Any chance all of this is related?I put brake grease on the back of them. I even bought more than what was included in the package. And yes those are all properly installed.
I bought the car used 4 years ago, the squealing started about a year ago with the OEM pads and continued with the replaced ones. So I’m just lost lol.It appears that new rotors would be the next step. Unfortunately, yours pads are probably shaped to the old problematic rotors.",,,,

Don’t leaf your day job, but your punny humor is well rooted if perhaps a bit sappy. It is contageous, isn’t it?Dutch Elm disease?It’s a true work of art.  I love how the use of wood from multiple types of trees has nuances of color and grain that decidedly enhance the artistry of the work.  It is as much a true sculpture as anything.
A well known sculptor in Oklahoma, Willard Stone, was a lifelong friend of my dad.  I always have marveled at how his carved wood pieces so beautifully make use of the grain of the wood.  He explained how he often spent as much or more time handling a piece of wood, studying it, thinking, and mentally picturing what he wanted to achieve than in the actual carving and finishing of a sculture.
I can easily believe that the maker of this car likely did much the same in choosing which woods to use in what ways making all the pieces and parts for his creation.
It’s interesting how an all wood structure is heavier than if made from metals.  It’s not something most people, including me, would normally think of.  But then there is good reason why working small model airplanes are made from wood use balsa.  Which thought then makes me think of Howard Hugh’s “spruce goose” plane.  But now I’m digressing far from cars.Here’s another I posted 4 years  ago:

Definitely true artistry!
But, let us not forget that most Franklin automobiles (built in Syracuse, NY) utilized wooden frames.   Those expensive, well-made cars were a true anachronism, with air-cooled engines and aluminum bodies, but wooden frames.


 Mustangman:

It could run on alcohol. If it did, the 2CV might be able to get out of its own way.


 jtsanders:

In the article’s defense, it appears to be machine-translated from another language. As a comment on the article points out, somehow what was probably “spalted elm” became “mangy elm,” etc.Most of the earliest cars had wood frames and floorboards at least until the mid 1900s. Car bodies were built with wood frames covered by sheet metal until the late 30s for most cars. 1934 for the Chrysler Airflow. The first all metal unit body car wasn’t built until the 1925 Lancia and even that car went back to body on frame by 1929 or so.Morgan still uses some wood.image1024×478 44.5 KBI saw that on the wood working board some years ago.  Someone had too much time on their hands.  I can see the ad.  For sale:  Fully restored Citroen, many hours invested, no rust, seat pads not included.  No reasonable offer refused.
It might have been used in a Varathane commercial but maybe that is just my imagination.I wonder if it’s as maintenance intensive as a wooden boat.

374,"Winterizing a 2011 Prius for -60. (Ft Wainwright, AK)",Maintenance/Repairs,25,2.5k,"Hello. First time on this forum. I need to winterize my car but I don’t know what I need to make sure it is done verses what is superfluous. I need a list or some direction to make sure it gets done right. Any help would be great. Thanks!You’ll be driving it during the winter, correct?  Not storing it?
I’d change the oil, put in full synthetic oil like 0W-20 (or whatever 0W is recommended for cold weather in your owners manual).  I’d also check that the coolant is up to full strength, and make sure the tires are fully inflated at low temp (they’ll lose quite a bit a pressure just cooling off that much).
Any way to use a block heater?Yea. I’m hearing a lot of stuff including block heater, coolant heater (and appropriate coolant), oil pan heater, trickle charger, batter blanket, and “three prong” which I think is the trickle charger.And yes it will be my sole conveyanceAlso, read about blocking the front grille for better efficiency here:
http://john1701a.com/prius/documents/Prius_User-Guide.pdf 17Are you talking -60 degrees wind chill? Or -60 degrees actual temp?
Because I’m in Minnesota, and once it hits -30 degrees nothing moves.
TesterIf you plan on staying in AK Regular fluids and changes as specified in the manual should be fine. I use a block heater at 15 degrees or less, checking the amps on the battery is the next most important thing, and you may even consider a heating blanket for the battery.-30 is a warm winter night in central Alaska…And whatever happens in Alaska comes to Minnesota.
TesterAnd North Dakota, ever hear of snirt? it is the snow that picks up topsoil as it blows across the plains and turns black, snirt = snow dirt!“And whatever happens in Alaska comes to Minnesota.”
But whatever happens in Las Vegas stays in Las Vegas. Or so I’m told. Use an ethylene glycol at a 2:1 ratio to distilled water.  The genuine Toyota coolant is adequate, but make sure you are getting the full strength and not the premix.
First, have the current coolant tested just in case it has already been converted to a 2:1 ratio.  You will probably need to find an old fashioned lead weighted tester to get a test in this range.  If it tests at -34F then it is a 50/50 mix.
Check your owners manual for the cooling system capacity.  Then drain the cooling system from the radiator drain and the block drain and measure how much is drained out.  Now you have to calculate how much full strength coolant and how much distilled water you will need.  All the coolant will not be drained out so this is critical, especially in your climate.
Lets say the coolant capacity is 8 quarts and you measured 5.5 quarts drained.  That means that you have 2.5 qts of 50/50 still in there.  That is 1.25 qts of ethylene glycol and 1.25 qts of water.  You need a total of 5.33 to 5.6 qts of ethylene glycol total for a concentration of 67 to 70%.  Now in a separate container, mix about 4.1 to 4.4 qts of full strength to 1.15 to 1.4 qts of distilled water.  Then tighten the drain plugs and fill the system.
Based on the table at this site:
http://www.magers.org/handy/antifreeze.html 1
a 60% mixture is good for -62F
a 66% mixture is good down to -74F
and a 70% mix will protect down to -84F
In the example above, if you only bought 1 gallon of antifreeze, and added 1.5 qts of distilled water, you would still be at around 65% so you would be good for your area.
What you may really need is a battery warmer more than an engine heater.  Not sure how well a Prius battery will perform in that extreme cold.  Hybrid performance seems to be very disappointing in very cold weather.
Here is another reference for you but keep in mind that it is an add for a specific product, but it does compare ethylene glycol to propylene glycol.  Propylene glycol is safer for the environment but for your area, you need to use it undiluted and that could be difficult to achieve unless you can find a freeze plug at the bottom of your engine and pull it out and replace it, or remove the engine and turn it upside down.

I would start the car whenever you can…and leave it running when ever it his -60. That may not be possible with a Prius. I would speak to a Toyota dealer to see what other preps could be made. I am thinking that a hybrid may not be the best vehicle and perhaps trading in the car for anything that generates heat all the time it’s running may be in order.otherwise, I would drive it from one heated garage to another.In cold weather my hybrid engine doesn’t shut down.-60 degrees is like  being on the moon.
Just try shifting your transmission at -30 degrees, and you’ll see why nothing moves.
TesterFirst I’d find out if anyone up there even drives a hybrid.   Extreme cold and batteries are not a great combination, and a Prius relying on its gasoline engine as its sole source of propulsion is going to be very slow and not outstandingly efficient.   Given their comparatively high resale value in places where they’re popular, you may be better off selling it and buying something more suitable for the climate.   I’d also find out what dealerships are nearby before buying anything.
My understanding is that some plastics become quite brittle in those extreme temperatures and a lot of cars end up with badly damaged bumpers from very minor impacts.  Not much you can do about that except drive very carefully and not nudge things with your bumpers.   And maybe avoid cars with low-hanging air dams that are likely to hit things."" @texases…my hybrid doesn’t shut down""  Ah ha…perhaps another reason to consider a different car for driving in these conditions.  Gas savings is minimized.  Everything I have read about these temps is; you use block heaters and inside storage and keep it running all the time when driving without the heater plugged in while shopping etc.
Seems like a Prius would loose many of it’s advantages. I am less concerned with the Prius storage battery then I am the starter battery as with an ordinary car. I would use what the locals use for cars and drive and prepare as they do. Agree with @MarkM@dagosa - you’re right, I wouldn’t buy a hybrid for Fairbanks. Don’t worry too much about the 12v battery though, it’s the big battery that starts the motor.Fairbanks Toyota stealership, remarkably, highly recommends against a block heater for the third generation. They say it has led to many melted transmission wires with as long as people plug in their cars up here. I’ve gotten by with a 100 watt oil pan heater and just a simple battery charger for the 12 volt battery just fine. The engine is very tightly blanketed with all the splash/wind protection underneath and below -40°(Same C/F) I just lay a blanket I keep in the back across the motor provided it’s not too hot, it’s a hybrid, does it ever get up to temp in the winter?..
The nmh battery does better for the cold charging and you’ll see average mpg around the 40s still in the winter unless you like to warm your car for half an hour then you’ll see more like 30-35mpg.
They still shut down and you still save a bundle “going out to eat” in the pandemic long drive through lines.

375,“new” tire age,Maintenance/Repairs,20,623,"I bought a new set of tires and noticed one of them had a mfg date that was almost 2 years ago.  That doesn’t sound “new”, especially since tire rubber has a 5-7 year life expectancy.  Tire dealer claims they can’t specify a maximum tire age less than 2-year old when ordering tires.  Is that reasonable?  I don’t recall ever getting new tires more than a few months old in the past.Their deliveries of “new” tires may have been slowed down due to Covid. Or perhaps the tire factories have slowed down production.
I wouldn’t worry about it myself.Don’t worry. Not an issue.Michelin actually says you can get up to 10 years from the date of manufacture but really, unless you don’t do much driving you’ll wear out your tires before they “die of old age.” About a year ago I replaced a set of Firestones that had been on my car for four years and about 30k.It is a commonly held belief within the tire industry that tires as old as 6 years can be sold as new.  I say “belief” because I know of no study that confirms this.
HOWEVER, the company I worked for tested 3 year old tires and could not find any difference to freshly made ones.
Further, the USTMA (US Tire Manufacturers Association) has stated that they know of no data that suggests there is a defined age limit, but they recommend replacing tires when they are 10 years old.
HOWEVER, heat is the tire killer, and it is clear that tires in - say - Phoenix, age much more rapidly than tires in - say - Minneapolis.  Many people in the hot climates suggest there is a 6 year limitation.
HOWEVER, the clock starts ticking when the tire is put in service (according to the tire warranties), so - referencing above - time in storage is not much of a factor when it comes to tire aging.  The only reason the manufacture date is used is because you can determine that from the tire, but you would have to have the invoice to tell when the tire was mounted to the vehicle. - and people usually don’t keep that, nor do they remember when that happened.Ozone attacks rubber.Exactly, even when the tires are kept in storage.
So why accept “new” tires with a significantly reduced lifespan?Only certain locations have enough ozone to affect tires in storage, and I bet most tires are more carefully stored these days.Aging in the warehouse is not a concern, it is insignificant.
I have seen specialty tires up to 4 years old come from the warehouse. The only problem I have is that by some repair standards a tire over 5 years old can not be patched, it must be replaced if punctured.One item I forgot to mention:
Tires have waxes, antioxidants, and antiozodants (AO’s) in the rubber to protect them when in storage - another reason why storage doesn’t contribute much to the tire aging picture.  These flake off shortly after the tire is put into service.


 CapriRacer:

I would not consider that a valid test.
A more meaningful test would be to
a) Determine the average age consumer keep tires.
b) Test a tire that is that age and a tire that is 3 years older.
Repeat test but instead of using average age, use a max average age.

Perhaps I could have worded that better:  They wanted to know if their standard of storing tires in their warehouses for up to 3 years (before scrapping them as too old) had any negative affects on tire endurance, so they ran an industry standard endurance test and could not find any difference in the results.
This was particularly applicable to winter and unusual tires (unusual by size or type - low demand).  But the testing strongly implied that tire aging really didn’t start until the tire was put into service.   Tire aging in service was something they already knew about.

That sounds like they are only testing a 3yo tire to a new tire. Again I don’t think that’s a valid test. A more valid test would be to test a tire that’s been in service for 6 years compared to a tire that was in storage for 3 years and then put in service for 6 years.Sounds like a reasonable test to me.  Tire companies can tell if a tire’s condition is degraded without waiting 9 years.  Are you saying there’s some concealed mechanism going on?  The condition of the tire’s components can be observed and measured.+1
It seems like the tire company was simply testing one variable: whether a three year storage period would change the failure rate of their usual tire tests. It was still the same life test they always performed, just on 3 year old tires.


 texases:

Are you saying there’s some concealed mechanism going on?


There might be. Many materials don’t degrade lineally. At 3 years they may be so close that any tests may not find any difference. But 3 years later those tests results could be extremely different.


 MikeInNH:

That sounds like they are only testing a 3yo tire to a new tire. Again I don’t think that’s a valid test. A more valid test would be to test a tire that’s been in service for 6 years compared to a tire that was in storage for 3 years and then put in service for 6 years.


The problem here is the “in service” part.  It’s normally highly variable (so it either has to be carefully controlled (hard to do!)  or you have to use large sample sizes.)    Plus, you don’t want tires failing in service - for obvious reasons.A retired bicycle dealer who used to participate in a bicycle forum, a very knowledgable fellow, lets his bike tires age 3 years before he uses them.Why?  Makes no sense to me.I dont think I would worry about 2 years.    5 plus then I would worry .",,,,
376,ABS activating on light pedal pressure on dry roads,Maintenance/Repairs,11,295,"I have a 2008 Isuzu Ascender which is basically a GMC Envoy with an Isuzu name on it .  While  driving at times the ABS is activating  under light pressure when coming to a stop  on dry roads.   Does not happen every time .  Does not seem to matter if the car is cold or if I have been driving awhile.  Every once in a great while it will aLso activate the  the stability/traction control when starting from a stop which then kills the gas  because it thinks the wheels are slipping I assume.   About a month ago had a right front wheel bearing replaced trying to fix this issue and that did not do it so I am assuming it is one of the other three most likely  .  Have read on these GM vehicles (trailblazer/Envoy)there is a tendency for corrosion to build up under the wheel sensor mounting surface  which then changes the “air gap”   between the sensor and what it reads in the wheel bearing  which can cause issues like what I’m seeing .  There is no lights on the dash other than when it occasionally activates the stability /traction control which then that light flashes briefly  while it kills power to the wheels  and then recovers and runs normally .   Any one run into issues like this ?   What was the remedy .   May have them clean all the mounting surfaces on the remaining sensors.  When I had it looked at before there was no abnormal codes stored so i am chasing an intermittent issue.  Thanks for any info .This happened on my Chevy Avalanche but only under braking as I do not have stability control. I cleaned the sensors. Replaced a wheel bearing (the other side was already new). It did nothing.
The solution I found was to level the truck side to side by adjusting the torsion bars. Yeah, that seems strange but… when one corner sags, the opposite side carries more of the load. Under braking, that extra load means the loaded wheel rotates a slight bit faster than the less loaded wheel and the ABS sees that like the tire is about to skid so it activates the ABS. Should also work similarly with stability control.
Put the truck on a level surface. Start at the front. Measure the ride height from ground to the top of the wheel opening. Compare that to the opposite side. It should be within 1/2 inch. If it isn’t, you need to find out why.  Look for a broken 1/2 a coil usually at the bottom. Same for the rear springs. Replace the spring or shim it on the low side to level it.Remove the wheel speed sensors and inspect their mounting surfaces for rust.
image1440×900 411 KB
When rust forms under these sensors, it causes them to become misaligned with the tone rings. This then causes the ABS to activate on dry roads when braking at slow speeds.

Trouble Shooter | Unwanted ABS Activation | MOTOR Magazine 3
Unwanted ABS Activation I’m working on a 2001 GMC Sierra 1500 with the 5.3L engine that came in with a complaint of low-speed ABS activation. I road-tested the truck to confirm the problem. The ABS light came on with the first slow stop. I checked...





TesterThis is what I was thinking too .  Seems to be an issue on GM vehicles .   Would this be on all 4 for this problem or will it usually be the front  sensors ?   One other question is when they replaced the right front bearing does the new bearing come with the new sensors attached ?   If it does then I should concentrate on the other side .


 vipergg:

does the new bearing come with the new sensors attached ?


No.
The wheel speed sensor is a separate component.

TesterYes, most new wheel bearing do come with new sensors. Gm at least. They can be removed for several years. If you want to look at them. Then the corrosion is so bad they are fused into the holes.When I drove school bus every chevy van chassis , suburban and our shop chevy pickup had recurring problems with this.  Usually the shop would replace a wheel speed sensor and that would fix it…for a while.Driving with worned tires can cause that also.The equinox I got last yr had the abs fuse removed. Of course I had an abs light. But no rumble. Till I put the fuse back in. I have changed 2 wheel bearings for noise but the rumble remains. Guess those 2 bearings were not the the sensor issue?What is next? First killer bees, then murder hornets, now tire worms.  Its just not safe to go out anymore.W  o r n e d Tires.

We have a 2008 RAV4 and heat or ac is only coming through the floor vents. When I push the button to change the direction to the defrost or dash vents I hear a noise coming from under the glove box.

379,Using the AC for heat,Maintenance/Repairs,50,134k,"Ever since I’ve known him, my husband uses the AC in the car for heat. It’s never made any sense to me, though he says it’s perfectly logical. Does the AC heat up a car any differently than just having hot air coming through the vents? Is he destroying our car’s AC system by using it all year long?No problem.
He’s NOT using the a/c just directing the air flow through the vents.
The heat and a/c are separate functions from the direction the air flow takes.
By the way, your a/c compressor runs when you select defrost anyway.
No problems.Yes, it dehumidifies the air.  This helps keep the windows from fogging up.
No, it is not harming the car or the AC system in any way.
All the cars that I have had with automatic climate control (including the two I have now) run the AC full time, even in the winter.It is logical to use the a/c for defrosting or defogging the windows.  The air conditioning not only cools the air in the summer, it also dries the air.  That’s why you see water dripping under your car in the summertime when the air conditioning is running.  It’s removing the moisture from the air.  It also makes sense to use the air conditioning along with the heat if your car has a tendency to fog the interior glass.  Some cars are worse about that than others, and using the air conditioner to dry the air coming through the vents will prevent that from happening.In addition, it’s good to use the AC periodically to keep the compressor seals lubricated.So then, Marriage wise,
even though you don’t care for the warm air flowing right in your face ( I don’t either but my daughter does ) just grin and bear it OP could you clarify?
I thought that you meant that he turns the AC compressor on.
Ken believes that you meant that he uses the dash register outlet setting.
Of course, it could be that he is doing both.
Either way, he is doing no harm.It will do no harm turning the AC on for faster heat in the vehicle. I’ve been doing it for years. It sure beats waiting for the coolant to get hot enough before you get heat out of the vents.
TesterYou’re correct, he hits the AC button.These responses are helpful. Thanks!The reasons why the car mfgs make the ac kick on when using defrost is twofold  One to dehumidify the air and Two…to keep the ac seals lubricated to prevent them from drying out and leaking.
NOW using it while you have the heat on in the winter all the time is foolish and wasteful…whats the idea here?  You want to dehumidify the already ARID winter air?   NOT logical…and why do you want the extra drag on your engine and the sapping of your fuel economy as well?  DOesnt make sense…the only area it makes sense is if you have a fogged up windshield…it will dry the glass and clear it up faster…other than that this is WASTEFUL and ILLOGICAL behavior…It would appear you don’t have an understanding of how a refrigeration system functions.
When the compressor compresses the refrigerant it passes thru the condenser converting the refrigerant into a high pressure liquid. This high pressure liquid then passes thru some sort orifice or metering device. This causes the high pressure liquid to convert back into a low pressure gas which absorbs heat. This low pressure gas can only reach a certain temperature once it passes thru the orifice tube or metering device. This temperature can be anywhere from 40?-50?. And that’s a fixed temperature
So if you set the vent system for heat at the floor or out the vents, turn the fan on high, set for fresh air, and turn the AC on, the air passing thru the evaporator will be heated to that 40?-50? heating the interior.
And you don’t run the AC all the time. You turn it off once the coolant gets hot enough where heat is supplied thru the heater core.
TesterNever heard of this before. I’m curious, do you still leave the heat setting on high or turn it down to get heat faster through the a/c?? I wan’t to give it a try next cold snap. (Which sounds like could be as soon as Sunday unfortunately.) OK, just so I’m clear, should my husband turn off the AC once the car has heated up? Or does it matter?I’d leave it on to keep the windows defogged.I turn the AC off once the vehicle is heated up. No use in running the AC when it’s no longer needed.
TesterUm, slight clarification:
When the compressor compresses the refridgerant, it heats up…as does all matter when compressed. The condensor removes the heat, bringing the compressed refridgerant back to roughly ambient. The compressed, ambient temperature, refridgerant is then put through an orafice and allowed to rapidly expand into the coils, whereupon it absorbs heat from the cabin air. That refridgerant is then recompressed, the heat again removed, and it goes back through the same process.
The moisture is removed because when the heat is removed from the cabin air by the coils it can no longer hold the same amount of humidity and the humidity is deposited on the coils as condensation, which is then drained away.
We may be saying the same thing in different ways. If so, please accept my apologies.""This causes the high pressure liquid to convert back into a low pressure gas which absorbs heat. ""
But where does the heat come from if it’s a sub zero morning? Doesn’t seem like you would be able to get that a/c air temp. up any warmer than what it already was inside the car??The heat comes from your cabin air. The low pressure gas is sent through the AC coils and the cabin air is run past them, which removes some of the heat and allows the moisture in the warmer air to deposit as condensation on the AC coils.
The AC does remove some heat. Without the AC on, the heating system will put more heat out the heater vents.
This actually is a pet peeve of mine. When the windshield is icy here in NH it was always my practice to blow hot air st the windshield through the defrost vents to melt the underlying layer of the ice and assist removal. My current car turns the AC on in the background when I turn the defroster on, and it doesn’t heat the windshield as effectively. It removes condensation, but doesn’t help the ice removal as much. I’d prefer being able to push only heat through the defrost vents without the AC in the background.
Having said all that, and remembering the original post, it does absolutely no harm to be running both at the same time. Your hubby probably learned his practice based on the “remove the condensation on the inside of the windshield” goal. He’s actually doing the correct thing, my preference aside.The heat comes from inside the evaporator where the refrigerant is converted into a low pressure gas. When this occurs, that gas reaches a certain temperature when contained in the evaporator. Usually between 40? to 50?. In the summer when it’s hot, this gas will absorb heat out of the air cooling it. When the temperature is cold, this gas still reaches a temperature of between 40? to 50? in the evaporator. So if you pass cold air thru the evaporator it heats the air. So when it’s -10? outside, and there’s 40? air coming out of the vents, it feels pretty darn good.

I suggest that you drive very slowly to a tire shop and get all four tires replaced.
Even if you don’t see the same defects in the other tires, if they are the same age, then they are ready for replacement.   And, because of the nature of your AWD system, all four tires have to match.
For the sake of your passengers and everyone with whom you share the road, please get all 4 tires replaced right away.Holy jeepers, how is that thing holding air?
I wouldn’t drive that 2 miles…if that’s the only tire doing this, put the spare on before you go to the tire shop.And you should buy dinner for who ever pointed that tire out to you .  This tells me that you are not paying good attention to your tires .  It also sounds like you may have not done some other things that should be done to this vehicle .

In addition to the importance of personally checking one’s tire pressure with a hand-held gauge on a regular basis, getting up close and personal with the tires while checking their pressure would readily reveal problems like this.

Will be sure to keep an eye on this closely going forward Sorry, I can see how what I said was unclear. What I meant was:

If only 1 tire is like that: put the spare on and drive to the tire store
If more than 1 is like that: don’t drive that vehicle, have it towed somewhere to get the tires installed

Either way, all 4 tires should be replaced.

However, please take this as a learning experience, namely that YOU need to periodically check your tires, in terms of both their inflation pressure and their general condition.
Thank God for your vigilant neighbor, but… what if he doesn’t notice a highly visible safety defect on your car in the future?What is the mileage and age of those tires. Falken Ziex?
Ever driven under inflated?The worst that can happen is the tire will blow out on the way to the tire shop and you’ll have to change the tire on the road.  If you don’t drive at a high rate of speed, you should not have trouble controlling the car at 45 mph if it does blow out.  I doubt it will be a problem though on your drive down.

So what if it is a discount shop ? Even some house brand tires will give good service .


 Bing:

Saturday is a normal business day
Just because Labor day is coming up on monday doesn’t mean a customer can’t expect a tire shop to do a good job installing a set of four tires
And those discount shops usually also stock some high quality tires, in addition to the cheapos.  Not everybody frequenting those places is specifically seeking store brand tires.  Those shops probably have some Goodyears and Continentals in stock.  Although I’m not partial to either of those two brands, they’re respectableAround here in our little town by the lake, the shop closes at noon on a normal Saturday and are usually booked for the day.  So ya plan ahead a little.The miracle is that the tire has not blown out already. If you think back a short time and remember the last time you were on the highway doing 70 MPH…
It almost looks to me like some underinflation issue.
Would I drive on it? Yes; but only to the closest tire store and while never exceeding 20 MPH. Even that is risking a blowout but at least the car won’t roll over on the roof.
Whoever pointed that out to you just may have saved your life.At work we stock Bridgestone, Dunlop, Michelin and Yokohama. When customers come in with those “other brands” (budget), I have seen a lot of split sidewalls due to poor quality rubber but the strength is in the plies so it is unlikely to rupture.
More of a concern is the number of tires I have seen with steel belts exposed and the owners chose to drive away on the bad tires, more than 100 in the last ten years.

381,2008 mitsubishi lancer acting weird lately (please help),Maintenance/Repairs,3,185,"Hello everyone,
i’m not from US so hope you can understand my english.
this is gonna be a bit long… (sorry)
I have a 2008 mitsubishi lancer (the last gen) and lately i have some problems that gets me crazy because not a single garage knows what the problems are.
I will start from the begining, ever since i bought the car i always had a weird noice when cold starting the car, not from the engine, from the exhaust/catalytic converter(not sure where exactly), but only when the car is cold. when its already warm, there is not a single noise.
lately the car started to act wierdly, i was driving with my friends and i was driving pretty fast, you know was having fun, and suddenly the car stopped responding to me, not entirely but i couln’t drive any faster, i pressed the gas pedal all the way and the car didn’t drive any faster, the engine was responding but the car didn’t. then i stopped the car and heared a ticking noise from the catalytic converter (it was cleary from there) and a engine check light tunred on. on the computer it said a “cylinder misfire 3”.
now this is where it gets even wierder, after 2 days, after night work on 6 am, the car didnt start. didnt even tried to start, i mean the starter didnt even made a noise, just nothing happned, but, after a hour, the car sunddely started like nothing happned, a day after it happned again.
now, i still have noises from the exhust/ catalytic converter and the car a bit struggles to drive(not always but very often) and the car starts normally.
I really can’t understand what is happening here. i went to so many garages and no one knows. they only say that the catalytic converter is broken, but i dont belive this is the only thing.
thanks in advance to the helpers.For the first issue, I’d guess that you have an exhaust restriction (something partially blocking your exhaust) in the catalytic converter or elsewhere. That could be what the garage means when they say the converter is “broken”, as pieces can come loose inside of it.yeah that’s what he explained, but could it really be it? because this thing isn’t cheap… and no one wants to take responsibility if everything is ok with my exhaust/ catalytic converterI supposed to go tomorrow to the garage to replace the catalytic converter, any suggestions before I do that? because this thing isnt cheap and if this thing won’t be the problem so it will be waste of money…
or any suggestion in addition to that?
someone told me that for the second problem, my plugs may be wet, and thats why the car didn’t start that day. (although the car starts now normally as far as i see).",,,,

Where are you hearing these every day ?Hard start with a gas smell from the oil… leaking injector is my guess. That causes gas to seep into the oil and may cause a hydrolock and destroy your engine if left alone. The car is 30 years old, there are only 4 injectors, replace them.
You also seem to have an electrical problem as well. That 10 minute wait thing is strange. Check every battery cable for good clean resistance free connections. If the car has a start relay (likely) replace that as well. See if that fixes the issue.Locate the fuel pressure regulator on the fuel rail.
image600×600 34 KB
Remove the vacuum hose from the regulator, and if gas leaks out this connection the regulator is leaking and requires replacement.
TesterIf it is indeed one  . . . or more . . . leaking injectors, this may damage the catalytic converter over time
Even if you replace the fuel injectors and the car has decent power, don’t be surprised if at your next smog inspection, you fail because the cat may not be in good enough shape anymore
If you live somewhere without emissions inspections, then some of what I said doesn’t apply to youContinuing the discussion from Have to leave ignition on for 10 minutes before car starts:

384,2012 Ford Escape difficulty starting after recall part replacement,Maintenance/Repairs,13,5.7k,"Fuel delivery module flange replaced in June, 2018 - a recall part replacement.   Immediately started having problems with long cranking times and fearful that it won’t start.    Worried about driving it out of town.   2012 Ford Escape with 50,000 milesThat’s part of the fuel pump ass’y I presume.  Long cranking times can be due to the fuel pump check valve not holding pressure.  This allows the fuel to leak from the fuel rail back into the tank when the engine is off.Next time you try to start the car, it takes some time before the pump is able to re-deliver the fuel to the fuel rail.   I suspect you have something wrong with the check valve function now.  An external fuel leak could cause this symptom too, so good idea to get it at least inspected right away.   Especially if you notice anything dripping  under the gas tank area, or if you smell a gasoline odor.   I expect it is just the check valve though, which doesn’t result in an external leak.  A fuel pressure test at the fuel rail would confirm or disprove this theory.Next time you try starting use this procedure. Be sure that it has sat non-running for awhile.
Turn the key to the “On” position , but not all the way to the “Start” Position, then turn the key to “Off”.
Do this 6-8 times, then try to start the engine.
If it starts…the check valve at the fuel pump is allowing the fuel to drain back into the tank as @George_San_Jose1 mentioned.

Get it back to the mechanic who did the work.  They should figure it out, probably at no charge.Yes, I have my 3rd apt coming up next week.  Thanks for your help.Any updates on this?

Now I’m working on getting a repair on gas cap evap leak.  My check engine light is on sporadically. Seems to be running ok.   I read this is a common problem on capless gas tanks.In case that’s not really the problem, the other thing that can cause that trouble code is a stuck evap purge valve, which is a common problem on a lot of cars.Thank you.My recall was done in August and soon after I started to have the long cranks as well.   I took to local ford dealer and they told me the long cranks are due to my fuel pump being bad.  And that the fuel seal that was replaced has nothing to do with it.  And being a female I just don’t see them being honest.  Is this true what they told me??More info might help. Year model of vehicle, mileage, etc.
It’s entirely possible a weak pump is causing hard starting. ALL fuel pumps will fail at some point depending upon various factors. The problem could also be related to the fuel pressure sensor.
A Recall is not all encompassing and does not even begin to address various other issues which are unrelated to that Recall.
I think it’s a bit premature to dig into the I’m a female so they are not honest blame game.

Agreed.
Also @Chris-731, if you don’t trust the dealership opinion, find an independent mechanic and have them diagnose the car.  Labor will likely be a lot cheaper for whatever the repair is- plus the mechanic may just be better.

386,Tires Losing Air Pressure,Maintenance/Repairs,24,598,"I have relatively new tires on my car. The last few months, they have been losing air pressure, requiring me to refill them once or twice per month. Two questions:

Why might this be happening? How do I fix it?
I bought a portable air compressor. I can make out two different PSI numbers on each tire. How do I tell which is the right one? I’d tell you what the tire says, but it’s really difficult to read (I need a magnifying glass).
Look on the drivers door jamb for a sticker that’s something like this.

That’s the correct tire pressure(s)
As far as losing air, have a shop dunk the tires in a tire water tank to locate any leaks.

 sundayDriver:

I don’t know what numbers you are referring to. The tire pressure number on the tire is the maximum psi the tire should be inflated to. The tire pressure you should use will be on the drivers door plaque . Some where around 30 to 33 psi .
And why are you not asking the place you bought the tires from about this ?You have a sticker on your car (often on the driver’s door jamb) that tells you the pressure to use.
Has it been getting colder?  That will decrease you tires’ pressure. Do you check them consistently, first thing in the morning before you drive?Thanks. I’ll look for that (I hope it’s still there and readable).
But do those numbers apply only to the original tires? I do not have the originals.
If they apply to any tire put on the car, then I’ve been overinflating them for the past few months. I don’t think over-inflating could cause them to lose air pressure, but maybe you all can correct me on that.I was referring to the numbers on the tires, but only because elsewhere on the internet I read that the tires’ sidewalls should tell you how much to inflate the tire to.  But you (and others in this thread).
I am asking here because it takes less time and physical effort than to drive all the way down to my auto-mechanic (3 blocks away) and because I want to learn.That’s the pressures for any tire mounted on the vehicle.

 sundayDriver:

But do those numbers apply only to the original tires? I do not have the originals.


That applies to any brand of tire on the vehicle . Two questions:
What have you been inflating these tires to ?
How long have you been driving ?
@sundayDriver   Put ( numbers on tire sidewall ) in Google and it will find you many articles that really explain the numbers on the tires.Thanks for your reply.
I meant to put in the top post that weather is not an issue (that was why I brought up “past several months”, but I didn’t finish the thought).
I do not check them consistently, but the dashboard info center tells me when tire pressure is low. It seems pretty accurate.Thanks. Is that because they are required to meet some standard? What I mean is, is there a chance I bought Cheapo Tire brand and the correct PSI is different


 VOLVO-V70:

What have you been inflating these tires to ?


I’ve been inflating them to about 35-40 PSI.
Been driving for a long time. But never had tires that lost air pressure, so I literally never put a moment’s thought into this basic subject. The mechanics check air pressure during oil changes and it lasts to the next oil change.Tire quality doesn’t change the recommended tire pressure specified by the vehicle manufacturer.
Tester


 sundayDriver:

is there a chance I bought Cheapo Tire brand


What–exactly–is the brand of your tires?
The brand of tire is unlikely to affect how they maintain pressure, but… just for the record… what brand and model are they?
Also, I have to reiterate that the correct pressure for your tires is listed on a very durable placard that is affixed to the driver’s door jamb.  Do NOT inflate the tires to the maximum pressure that is listed on the sidewall of the tire.
All of that being said, if your tires keep losing pressure, the problem probably lies in either the rims (the integrity of the seal can deteriorate over time with certain wheel rims…), or the tire valves.   The tires themselves are unlikely to be the problem.Very good advice on the tire pressure, look at the sticker on the door,  if a tire fits your car it has to meet basic standards which includes air pressure.
Tell us about your car, make  model year etc.  My daughters 2012 RAV4 had one tire leaking, it was the rim rusting around the tire valves,  I noticed a lot of older RAV4’s with the same rust.  No way to repair it, so she now has some snazzy new rims and no more leaks.


 sundayDriver:

But do those numbers apply only to the original tires? I do not have the originals.


Did you change the tire size? If not, then the label still applies.
Note that the pressure molded on the tire says “maximum”, not “recommended”.
As for the supposed leak, assuming this isn’t the pressure going down with lower temperatures as would be expected, you can spray the tire with soapy water, especially around the bead area and the valve stem, and look for bubbles.2013 Chevy Impala.Did not change the tire size.
I’m going to do that (spray the tire). TYDepending on where you live, a loss of 5 pounds over the last month or two could be normal.
Here in AZ, we had high temps of over 100 degrees 2 months ago, and last week were in the 60’s.  My wife’s 2012 Malibu lost about 5 psi per tire due to temp swing. My trucks at work have lost a little more than that due to their larger size.I had a leaky tire, took it off, put it in the tub (I’m single.), found no leak.  Took it to the llantero, who had a deeper tub, found the leaky valve.  Had I just sprayed the valve with soapy water I could have figured it out myself.  I lack tire tools, so I’d still have to go to the llantero.  He charged $2.

That’s the same size. You go with a wider tire (aka larger footprint) then the tire pressure will be lower.",,,,
387,2018 Fiat 500X - Stalls,Maintenance/Repairs,6,254,"Car stalled on two occasions during left hand turns. Dealer says the engine will shut down if oil level is low to prevent damage. Car has 24,000 miles on the odometer, has had all oil changes per owners manual at dealership, and was purchased new. Never had this issue with other cars.If the dealer is correct then you should check the oil level at least once a week before you start the vehicle. Add what ever it takes to put it back to full . If no more stalling then problem solved.Your suggestion is appreciated but that’s like putting a bandaid on a major wound. The car has only 24,000 miles, the maintenance schedule has been followed and the car is still covered under factory warranty. The oil consumption indicates a serious issue with piston rings or maybe an oil pump? Waiting to correct the core issue may cause more damage. These symptoms can link to major repair bills after the warranty expires.Off hand I don’t know what Fiat considers normal consumption, but most manufacturers say somewhere around 1000 mile/quart.  That you got extremely lucky with not following the manufacturers recommendation to routinely check your oil does not apply to your current car.
If you ruin your engine due to running it with insufficient oil may well void your warranty.Every car needs to have the oil checked regularly. Your comment about checking oil being a band aid is incorrect.  Any one who has worked on internal combustion engines knows the importance and value of regular maintenance such as checking the oil.  Maintaining the oil is the easiest and cheapest thing you can do to get the maximum life out of an engine.

I’ve noticed after driving for periods of 20 minutes or so that it has been having issues once I need to stop and maybe even feather the clutch in tight traffic. So basically if I have to stop and go it will lurch/lunge/jerk forward AND backward and continue to do this until i’m finally just accelerating all the way past the tight traffic.
I’ve read that it could be the engine mounts, fuel system, air intake, cat converter, all sorts of things. This car has/had a known issue with its PCV valve and a misfire on cylinder #4. They were recalls and were done, it then later had an issue with a misifire on #3 and then all the plugs and a coil were replaced. So it has no more issues with a misfire. What do you guys think it could be? Thank you.I think it might be a dirty throttle body. Have it cleaned, or clean it yourself. It isn’t hard, lots of YouTube videos on this. Try that and report back
And tell us if the check engine light is on. If it is, have the codes read at the auto parts store and post those exact codes… not what the counter guys says they mean… the actual codes, and we’ll go from there.I have my own OBD II scanner, it doesn’t have any codes.

So,  got one of my tires punctured and had to switch on the spare tire (passenger side front).
Then went to a repair shop and the owner told me that I can replace one tire.
ended up getting a single tire of the same brand (bridgestone, ecopia h/l 422 plus)
After replacing the tire, I measured the 4 tires and the new one is 1/14-1/16 inch thicker than the rest…
The rest of the tires had 17k miles on them
I read online about how having a mismatch in tire size causes trouble with AWD system and system and what not… was wondering if I need to replace all 4 tireSome cars are very sensitive to the different diameter of a single replaced tire. Subarus for example, you would need to replace all 4 per the owners manual.
What does your owners manual say about this?.. I’ll tell you, page 483 says to replace tires in pairs on a given axle. So you need one more new tire, not 3.Ask a tire shop to shave the new tire down so it matches the other three.

If you remove the bulb, then it won’t come on for the bulb test when you turn the key to ON, and you’ll also fail the inspection.

Thanks.Torque might have an extra cost app after you buy the Pro version that may allow younto read the airbag codes. You will still have to fix whatever set the light.So what triggers the light? Could a sensor be bad? Worse case, if you know, what would it cost? This car is a fossil but in very good condition. I appreciate your responses!Depend on the code. Could be a broken wire,  bad sensor or similar. Worst case is probably not the cost but the lack of repair parts.OK, I can see you are way ahead of me on this. Can my OBDI II read the code.

Has the car ever been wrecked and/or in an accident?
What I’m getting at is this . . .
Any chance the warning light’s on because an airbag and/or electronic tensioning retractor has in fact deployed . . . ?!Good point, and thanks. No, the car has never been in a collision. I took it in for an evaluation and the SRS Code says the passenger side bag is bad. At this point, what Mustangman said about parts is playing out, although I see some options on ebay. Thanks again for your response.There’s a chance you don’t need to replace the actual passenger airbag, but only the connector known as the “squib”
It’s clear you don’t want to pay for diagnosis
However . . . a savvy mechanic armed with the factory trouble tree and wiring diagram(s) should be able to properly diagnose this in short order
And what if he determines that you don’t in fact have to scour the ends of the for an unobtainable part, but instead just need to fix some broken wire(s) or splice in a new squib . . . ?!


 marktwark:

SRS Code says the passenger side bag is bad.


I suspect that the fault reads; Open circuit in passenger airbag squib.
I have also seen many squib connector problems, there are sometimes replacement connectors available. Unplugging and reconnecting the airbag connector will sometimes temporarily restore the connection.
To offer clarification, the squib is the ignition device inside the airbag inflator cylinder, not the connector.
There is a rumor that salvage yards cannot sell airbag components however if you check LKQ you will find a dozen passenger airbags for your vehicle offered via their network of associated salvage yards for $55 to $62.
There are also companies that offer used and refurbished airbag parts;

Interesting. Had I known about the “squib”, I would have attempted to locate and fix it myself. I have taken the car for a diagnostic and yesterday, he indicted the passenger airbag.

Thanks for your input - - that was very helpful.Never heard of LKQ but they sure do have the part! I wish I knew where that squib was located - - I’d be right at it!

 Nevada_545:

The local “you pull it” yard here absolutely refuses to sell any used airbags under any circumstances, and has signs to this effect where you enter.  They would rather crush the cars with the airbags intact than let customers buy them.  Of course, they claim it’s due to “safety reasons” and because they “care about the customer”, but anyone who would be considering a used airbag either can’t afford a new one, or cannot obtain one because the part is discontinued.


 marktwark:

I wish I knew where that squib was located - - I’d be right at it!


The squib is inside the airbag cylinder, it is not serviceable. The squib is the ignition device for the propellant. The airbag control module monitors the squib circuits to insure they are not disconnected or shorted.The shop I took the car to just called and said they won’t buy the part from LKQ even though they deal with them. He said if I buy the part, they will install it but will double the labor if it does not work. He suggested I call the state police to see if I can get an exemption due to lack of parts.

Exhaust leaks can be dangerous to your health.+1 to Mustangman’s comment.
However, I want to offer an alternative explanation, namely the possibility that the transmission is slipping (if it has an automatic trans), or that the clutch is slipping (if it has a manual trans), thus causing the engine to “rev” higher than it should.

Wish they had videoed getting it out of there.Had some friends towing their sailboat and wanted to get off the main roads for sleep. They hear a rapping on the window at 6 am, turned out they were on a cart path of a golf course.How did he/she/it get out?  I dunno but when my 2 door VW was smashed, I had to go out through the sun roof.  Multiple means of egress are important.Could have gone out the passenger side door, not easy but looks possible.

395,Sonoma Starter R & R conumdrum,Maintenance/Repairs,1,190,"Hi guys & gals,  I have a 1995 GMC Sonoma, reg cab, 5spd, V-6, 4X4, a/c.  I need to replace my starter.  Have viewed several youtube vids.  Most show having to remove “shield” from flywheel area.  My truck doesn’t have a shield.  So have any of you actually replaced a starter on this exact body/equip style p.u.?  I pulled the front rt wheel and crawled under.  It appears that I need to unbolt the clutch release cyl. But, it sits very close to the oil pan and I really don’t want to drop that.  There is a metal bracing rod that I can remove for a little more room to drop the starter from underneath.  I will need to be careful about bending the clutch release cyl because of condition of the tubing.  Removing the exhaust manifold from a 25 year old truck doesn’t sound like much fun.
So, has anyone here “been there, done that”?  I could really use some tips.  ThanksWell, now I have been there, done that.  Disconnect neg battery terminal!!  Jack up pass front side and then use a jack stand for safety.  Remove wheel.  Go through rubber fender flap to remove starter cables.  Put a string through the wire connectors and pull them up out of the way.  Remove torque bar for starter removal room.  Remove clutch slave cyl.  There is just enough room to scrape by the oil pan. Carefully remove boot and engagement  rod from cylinder and gently move the cylinder out of the way.  Remove the plastic plug close to the slave.  You will use this opening to align the rod when reinstalling.  Don’t let anyone push down on the clutch as you will then have to bleed it off.  I locked my drivers side door to keep “me” out.
With a jack and small block of wood placed under the rt frt mtr mount, I removed the bolt that runs through the mount.  Next with a bottle jack and block of wood placed under the transmission tailpiece, I loosened the 4 bolts that support the tailpiece.  I backed them out till there were only 3 or 4 threads holding them in.
I then jacked the front motor mount up about a 1/2 inch.  Now loosen but don’t remove  the two bolts holding the starter in place.  There is a flywheel dust cover that must be loosened so it will drop down about 3/8ths of an inch.  It is held in place by 3 8mm screws.
Now it’s time to drop the starter.  Remember, it’s heavy so watch your fingers.  Pull the flywheel cover down about 1/4"".  You now have all the room available.  I had to keep the solenoid leaning toward the frame for removal.  I turned the starter every which way but loose in order for it to come out.   It was no easier to put back.  Now reverse the order for putting everything back together.   I’m 75 years old and did this on the ground. Total time was about 5 hours including getting up to fetch all the things I found I needed.

More likely to broken into so don’t leave anything tempting in the car.If it were me I would not bother on a 23 year old truck.
Assuming you mean difficult to hotwire to keep someone from heisting the entire truck? If so, the easiest method would be to split the control wire from the ASD relay and rig up a hidden toggle switch inside the truck.
If you mean theft prevention to keep people from looting the interior then good luck.


 sharpiestories:

or does my truck make the new enough cut of “difficult to hotwire” and I shouldn’t worry?


A determined thief will take a vehicle and if they can’t they will do so much damage you might wish they had .  The best thing to do is not leave anything in the vehicle period .
Even upscale areas have problems with theft so be concerned but making yourself paranoid will serve no purpose.If the thief really wants the car, he’s got a quick-pick tow truck, and he’s getting it whether he can hotwire it or not.
As a direct answer, yeah, your truck is fairly easy to hotwire. The Dodge trucks didn’t have transponder keys until the early 2000’s as I recall. But I wouldn’t worry too much about an old truck like that.If you have a bed storage locker I’d be more worried about that.Trucks from the 1990’s are an easy target for thieves that need a vehicle to commit burglaries, robberies and to get across town to make a drug deal. Locally there were two truck owners shot to death while interrupting a thief stealing their truck, bad people carry guns.
Your truck is easy to steal, I can remove your ignition switch and install my own in less than a minute, start and drive off (hot-wiring is for the movies).
The ignition switch housing is plastic, a thief is going to pull the ignition lock cylinder out of the ignition and use a screw driver to turn the ignition. Before immobilizer systems I used to see a lot of theft recovery repairs.
Remove the panel below the steering column, you will have easy access to the ignition switch wiring to be able to install a kill switch in one of the critical circuits.",,,,

Car make?
Car model?
Car model-year?
That information is needed to begin a discussion. Also, by finding out what in the steering system is causing the play will determine whether or not it can be reduced or eliminated.
As with any used car, particularly one with something going on that draws your attention, it needs to be carefully inspected by a knowledgeable mechanic/technician.

  Not sure why you would think a vehicle would be built with ’ play ’ in the steering . I always say if you are looking at a used vehicle and you have questions about it look some more. There are thousands of used vehicles on the market.Some cars like my 2012 Corolla has very light steering fell(more assistance) that some drivers might like or don’t like…A Honda civic on the other hand has a heavier feel(less assistance) more direct response.Every GM vehicle that I’ve ever owned had adjustable play in the steering box. It can be adjusted easily but there is a technique involved. I won’t address the technique here because the adjustment can damage the steering box if not done properly.

Not sure why you would think a vehicle would be built with ’ play ’ in the steering


Well, I am going to “improve” your statement by altering it a bit:
Not sure why you would think a modern vehicle would be built with ’ play ’ in the steering
“Play” in the steering was pretty-much a given, up until the '80s or so.   Since then, “play” in the steering wheel has been unusual, and can be an indication of excessive wear in components such as tie rod ends.Without more information I strongly suspect there’s excessive wear in one or more front end parts. It may even be why the car is for sale. If you’re getting a great deal it might offset the cost of repairs but your best bet is to arrange an inspection by a qualified mechanic. If the seller balks at this, move on.Some vehicles wander more than others. Vehicles with aggressive tires and/or recirculating ball steering systems are more prone to wander than ones with highway tires and/or rack & pinion steering. Wandering can be interpreted as “play”.
So, what do you drive now and what is this potential new vehicle?I have a 77 grand Prix, and it has a little play in the steering. I took it to a reputible shop, they checked the front end, and said they found nothing loose, but wouldn’t attempt to adjust steering box due to possible lockup. I have another mechanic who will do the adjustment, so what do I tell him to do? I had a Ford Courier pick that had play in steering and it was tightened up with just a 1/2 turn.If your person is actually a mechanic, he will know what to do. You should not need to tell him.

404,Trouble starting 1997 Mitsubishi Montero Sport XLS,Maintenance/Repairs,6,154,"Hello! This is my first time on a car forum, so bear with me! I’m having trouble starting my 1997 Mitsubishi Montero Sport in the cold. I’m in Alaska so the winters are really cold. At night it reaches the negatives. As far as I know, the previous owners didn’t have trouble starting it in the winter. Yesterday I put gas in my car and when I went to start the car it wouldn’t even try to crank. I got the car jumped later that day and it ran fine, just couldn’t turn it off until﻿﻿ I was home. It has an almost brand new alternator and starter. I just put a brand new battery with 850 CCA in it last night. I plugged the block heater in, though I’m not positive that it’s working anymore. This morning I went to turn it on and it TRIED to crank but very slowly. Tried to jump it with an extra battery, nothing. I’m not sure if my starter might be extremely cold, engine is too cold, battery is too cold. I’m thinking I might need a battery jacket, but I’m not sure that that’ll fix the issue. Anything helps! Thank you!!Start checking for resistance in the cables throughout the starting system. Check for good battery grounds to the frame and to the engine. Check for low resistance connections to the starter itself through the battery cables.
On a 23 year old truck, assume that EVERY major battery connection and ground is corroded and needs cleaning up. Once you determine the voltage and ground are getting to the starter, then consider the starter may be worn out.My only concern about this is that it has always started up perfectly fine for me in summer. It has slowly but progressively gotten slower and slower at turning over as the temperature gets colder. Could the cold weather just cause the corrosion to finally show through and effect the battery?Cold has negative affects on stater and battery. But the first line of attack is doing what @Mustangman suggested. When the circuit is clear it should overcome the negative effects of the cold unless there is a mechanical problem. First things first.What viscosity oil is in the crankcase?  If the oil is too thick, it will o.k. in the summer months, but in cold weather, it may be too high a viscosity and is therefore too thick to let the engine turn over as it should.Cold temps make the amps needed to spin the engine higher. Cold makes the battery weaker.
Any problems with the wiring that normally would not affect starting will appear when it gets cold.The oil in my car is 5w-30. I forgot to mention that my car started last night right after I put the new battery in, though it did crank somewhat slowly. Is something draining my battery? Or is my engine too cold?",,,,

If I turn on the air without the a/c it still makes the noise. The truck is silver.The advice of this site’s founders would be not to worry if you can’t hear the noise over the radio. Hard to say from your description if the sound is rotational or vibrational. Where does it sound like it’s coming from? Do you only hear it inside the vehicle?
A shot in the dark guess would be a loose heat shield with the first suspect being the exhaust manifold cover. At least that was the first heat shield to loosen in my 08.

I’d know what the answer was if it was red, but I’ve never worked on a silver one.  
joking aside, have you taken this to the dealer? Your truck should still be under warranty (unless you have driven a ton of miles in the last 2 years- you didn’t say.)  But what mdixter says is along the lines of what i was thinking- an exhaust leak at low rpm’s.  Your engine should up the rpm’s a smidge when the a/c is on, and just enough to make the noise go away.

TesterNO unless the dealer is your son in law, in which case everybody needs rustproofing!I concur that is most cases you do not need rustproofing.
However…it really depends on where you live. Where I grew up in Central NY…cars still rust out there at a much faster rate then the rest of the country due to the amount of snow and the amount of road-salt used. Here in NH we average a lot less snow, thus a lot less road salt, so we’ve never seen the need for rust-proofing. If I moved back to Central NY, then I’d consider it.
So the question is…Where do you live?


 MikeInNH:

the question is…Where do you live?


Yes, location is a factor, but the fact remains that–no matter where he lives–applying rust-proofing to a car that is now more than a year old is not a good idea.


 VDCdriver:

Yes, location is a factor, but the fact remains that–no matter where he lives–applying rust-proofing to a car that is now more than a year old is not a good idea.


If it’s done right…then it’s not an issue. Ziebart is still around in central NY. They have a process that will eliminate any current rust that’s not a rust through situation before they apply their rust protection.
The caveat is - it has to be done right.Barring disassembly of the car, there’s no way to “do it right” because moisture will get up into crevices that neither Ziebart nor anyone else can get it out of before putting the rustproofing on and sealing that moisture in.
And they will tell you that this doesn’t happen at Ziebart because they use oil rather than undercoating, but then in another pitch they’ll tell you their oil is special and solidifies on contact with the car so that it won’t drip.  Well, if it solidifies, then it’s gonna trap moisture somewhere.
Besides, any more the frames are pretty rust resistant - at least for long enough that you’ll be more than ready to get rid of the car by the time the frame dies, if the car is even still running by then.  The big problem is ugly body rust, and that’s mostly caused by paint chips due to road debris impact.
So, before every winter get a good, bright light and go over every inch of the car, paying particular attention to the wheel wells and the front of the hood. Fill every paint chip, removing any surface rust that might be there first. And consider getting a clear bra for the front of the car, otherwise your hood will end up looking like it has acne with all the touchup paint you’ll be putting on it.
And avoid the temptation to get the car washed every 5 minutes. All you’re doing is taking a high pressure hose and forcing salt water up into those crevices, giving it the chance to do some damage before it drains out.  I’m not saying never wash the car, but it doesn’t need to look perfect all the time in the winter.


 shadowfax:

They have these things called scopes that can get into places without disassembly.
As I said…very few places in the country would ever benefit from rust proofing. I haven’t had a vehicle rust proofed in over 30 years. A few cousins and Sister who still live in Central NY swear by it. They’ve seen the benefits.This was back in 1969, so maybe the product has improved.  My FIL bought a brand new Ford F100 pickup truck and immediately had the Ziebart rust proofing done.  In four years, it had rusted worse than any vehicle I have ever seen in a four year period including Ford pickup trucks. He lived in an area that receives a lot of lake effect snow from Lake Michigan.


 MikeInNH:

If you seriously think they’re meticulously going through every crevice in the entire underside of the car with razor-thin air blasters to blow water out before spraying the oil for less than $250 then you have a lot more faith in their resistance to the profit motive than I. 



 MikeInNH:

Unless they’re buying two identical cars and rustproofing only one of them to see which one rots first, that’s a rather unscientific test. When I sold my then-13 year old Acura awhile back, I first had to do an axle repair which let me look at the undercarriage. Looked great. In fact the only rust on the whole thing was from paint dings that I’d missed, and no undercoating service is going to prevent that.
In short, it’s possible that the Ziebart is doing nothing for their vehicles because the vehicles came from the factory sufficiently resistant to rust - and they couldn’t know if this were the case unless they started with the two vehicles and only rustproofed one.

You see it all the time. Many Ziebart vehicles will have a sticker in the  window. A 5yo Ziebart vehicle looks a lot better then one that’s not in that area. This area averages over 200"" snow a year. Lots of salt.  Vehicles that don’t rust out in other parts of the country can/do there.

Come to think of it those John Deere tractors that require certified dealer repairs obviously have BLACK BOXES to prevent unauthorized ‘field repairs’ or modifications.  I wonder how litigation on that issue is going.It may bring some buyers back to a minivan, suspect more would stick with a Highlander or Venza@Rod-Knox. I grew up in the country.  We had a small acreage, but my parents weren’t farmers.  I attended a country school where the parents of my classmates worked hard to eke out a living on their farms.  Many of the men also worked in the factories to make ends meet.  These farmers did their own repairs to keep their tractors running.  Our school bus drivers were owner/operators who lived in the community and did most of their own repairs to keep their buses on the road.
When I was a teenager, I was able to do a lot of repairs and maintenance on my parents’ cars.  The 1952 Dodge with its flathead 6 was particularly easy to maintain. I had no problems overhauling the two stroke engine on our Lawnboy mower.
Now I know I haven’t kept up with the times.  I know engines have become more fuel efficient.  I know we can’t return to the old days.  However, I know the farmers I knew in the 1950s would be up in arms about farm equipment they purchased, but would not be allowed to maintain and repair that equipment.
One thing that helped the U.S. in WW II was that many of our servicemen had worked on their own vehicles and could easily be trained to work on army vehicles.  Many servicemen knew how to repair radios and could easily be trained to repair and maintain communication equipment and radar.
I feel a sense of frustration today that I really can’t do much in the way of repairs to my vehicles.  My television set is essentially a throw away appliance.

And that is when a smart father would explain to his daughter that a car is an appliance, not a fashion statement or status symbol.  It is a machine which takes you where you need to go, and what you should seek is a model which will provide the most “bang for the buck”, which minivans have done for years.  No other vehicle can transport as many people, carry as much cargo, and provide as much fuel economy as a minivan, and minivans cost less than full-size SUVs or “crew cab” pickups.@bcohen2010 @old_mopar_guy.

It will qualify for tax credits as long as it’s a PHEV, but it would still be a very expensive minivan. We looked at the Pacifica PHEV, Pacifica, and Odyssey. The Pacifica PHEV was still more expensive than a comparable equipped Pacifica by a couple grand, and you would have to install a 240v home charger to make it practical. That would cost $1500 or more, depending on how far your circuit box is from the garage or driveway. Mrs JT was not at all impressed with the gains in gas mileage when I told her that an electrician would have to cut some holes in the drywall in a the basement and garage to snake the power line to the garage.
Pacifica PHEV sales in 2019 were about 5700 while all Pacifica sales were around 18,000. Expect a similar ratio for the Sienna hybrid, except the ratio will apply to the top trim levels. I like the idea of PHEVs as a bridge to fully electric vehicles, but IMO it will take too long to build a customer base to make it a winner. Camry sales in 2019 were 337,000 and Prius sales were 70,000. A big gap, and that’s for two mature model lines.I expect to see more vehicles like the Ford Transit Connect .

410,Is there any smoothing applied to speedometer and tachometer gauge motors?,General Discussion,10,460,"Hello fellow car enthusiasts!
I know this topic is crossing a bit to electronics but its still related to cars I think 
Im trying to make an instrument cluster (speedo, tacho etc) by myself to use it in my car which only has digital speedo. Most cars these days (that use analog gauges) use stepper motors to drive speedo and tacho needles. I have successfully come to a point where I captured some data about my drive from OBDII port and wired up my motors to test rig. Now I dont know how often speed and rpm values are sampled usually, but in my car I can only get them at 180ms intervals from OBDII port. If I “play” captured values to my cluster, the motors jerk (probably because sampling rate is too low). If I play them to BMW E36 cluster however, the movement is much smoother (see attached videos)
Is there any hardcore car enthusiast here that can tell me if any smoothing algoritm or similar thing/trick is used in those clusters so that they dont seems jerky ?
cluster comparison
Many thanks!I can’t answer your question directly other than to say the BMW display does seem to have some damping/filtering in the cluster based on your test. Based on my own observations, gauges in my cars that use stepper motors have between a LOT and a HUGE amount of filtering.
Why don’t you add your own filtering to the signal? Use a simple 3, 5 or 7 data point averaging in the signal you feed the stepper motors. Fewer the samples, the better or the signal will lag. Lag for speed is not such a big deal. Lag in the tach signal would be a big deal.Since values are coming in so scarcely, this type of filtering would make quite a huge delay in tachometer yea  Also in 540ms (3*180ms if using 3 values for average) a lot can happen, the needle could have already moved over half the gauge and back, but if doing average this would get lost
It must be something about cluster’s actions based on next number that comes in, ie if it far away or close to current position could influence how much acceleration does needle have to do to reach it, if its far maybe its more jumpy than if its close (then it looks “lazy”). On my cluster it looks like the needle is too eager and arrives at destination value before next value is available hmm
Look at this:
at the end it sloowly stops https://youtu.be/2bPcrHnFDW4?t=7 1
when changing direction mid path, its much more responsive: https://youtu.be/2bPcrHnFDW4?t=18


 Denis-86:

Also in 540ms (3*180ms if using 3 values for average) a lot can happen, the needle could have already moved over half the gauge and back


The readings still change every 180 ms if you’ve done the filtering correctly. Think about that. You have a stream of data averaging 3 points posting every 180 ms, not every 540 ms. If you don’t like that, use a low pass filter set at about 10 hz.
Considering how fast the speed actually changes… figure 0-60 mph in 3 seconds, or 16.6 data readings, or 3.6 mph (corrected per Keith’s keen observation) per 180 ms reading, I think this will work. Try it, if it doesn’t work, try a low pass filter.


 Mustangman:

figure 0-60 mph in 3 seconds, or 16.6 data readings, or 0.278 mph per 180 ms reading,


That should be 3.6 mph every 180ms.  But the momentum in the movements should smooth out the transactions some what.Smooth vs. perfectly correct…
Concentrate on the tachometer, since the engine is able to change from 800 to 9000 RPM in a very short time.  Clearly, even in 180 ms, the engine has made a significant change in RPM.   So, even the 180 ms data dump gives smoothing. My question is this: exactly what do you want that tach to read? Are you going to read the tach and use that information in any significant way?
I am going to take a WAG and say the following: it is quite possible that more than smoothing of data is occurring. Since the gauges are getting their data from a computer, that computer is likely to be giving a PREDICTED data.  The computer can see the car speed and engine speed rapidly rising, and compute the acceleration and use this to smoothly predict a future value (that is, milliseconds later).  Of course, all this makes a disconnect from the actual instantaneous values of RPM and speed…but who cares?  We don’t really drive with the expectation to know our mph to three or four significant digits at every given instant during a huge acceleration. Bottom line: we definitely want the computer to give simulated data to the gauges.Sorry for late reply, my job prevented me from trying this earlier. So I have applied a moving average with size of 3 to my values that I send to motors and result was this:
VID 20201118 214349
Now I see there are actually two levels of smoothing here: one is smoothing out the actual readings from the engine, ie if engine ramped up rpm, we expect that needle would only move up. While this, in essence, is happening (rpm in increasing), it could have those small jerks or dips where  rpm would would jump up and down a bit multiple times. This would cause needle to not move smoothly up but go down a bit, then up again then down again a bit before reaching it final position where rpm would settle.
The other smoothing is interpolating missing values between readings. In its basic form the needle controller has no idea what should be between two values, it just assumes needle must move from point A to point B and does this without any regard for how this actually looks (cosmetically). This then looks like jerky incremental movements (as seen in video). The solution must be something in line with controller delaying for one value so that it knows where next needle position will be in advance and then calculates the needed acceleration and speed. This way the controller knows not to decelerate if next value will not land in vicinity of previous value and just continue on, thus movement will look smooth. Or if next value lands close to previous value, just a bit more forward, it will know to start decelerating a bit.
Now this sounds all nice and dandy but how to actually do this is another story or if it even has merit

The awesome guy who wrote this library also suggested to try to slow down the needle so that it would travel the desired distance in exactly 180ms (in time for next reading)I am going to read the tach but cosmetically pleasing looks has priority over complete correctness. Yea its more or less for the looks but I dont want it to be completely off / misleading
I know what you mean with predicted data, but did they do that in cars made in mid 2000s, did they have enough computing power? Or even those BMW dials I have from E36 which is from the late 90s. Probably they do some filtering before reporting this value as “the speed” or the “rpm” tho, I agree with you, and I completely agree that totally accurate values should not be the goalNot too bad. Much smoother than example 1. Good job.Thanks! Will have to play more with this and see where it leads I cannot answer your question as something like this is not anything I’ve ever been involved with.
However, from some past experience with European cars I can say that many of them use a solid state voltage regulator to maintain a steady voltage supply. Maybe voltage ripples are causing fluctuations. We always called them pitchforks. No idea if this will help or not.

If the car is not driven on salty roads, he salt can’t just wander over and attach itself to the car, so no issues there.

I never park inside my garage in winter because it is heated and will promote rust. Also,most cars start to rust in the spring when warmer weather set in.So, most cars spend their lives outside.
So, this may not actually be an issue.
So… why does anyone begin his/her sentences with the conjunction, “so”?
My vehicles are only garaged at night…well until Covid. Most of the day they’d be parked in a parking lot at work. Unless you clean the vehicle every night before you garage it…then it’s the same as parking outside. Live with it.I’ve mostly noticed this with younger folks on the West Coast.Wait till it’s  -20f. That’s where garage is helpful.If you live where I live salt can definitely wander over onto your car.I live about 300 ft off a 4 lane 40 mph road to my west and about 2000 feet North of an Interstate. Our prevailing winds is from the Southwest.  We get a lot of wind. I put up a 6’ stockade  fence down one side of my back yard about 90 degrees to the wind.  It was on 4x4 lumber set in concrete 3’ deep. The wind kept snapping the 4x4s.  I finally had to set the posts 4’ apart rather than 8’.
Iplanted some blue spruce when I moved here 50 years ago/  They died even though though I kept them well watered and they had good drainage.  The nurseryman’s diagnosis.was too much salt spray.  It dries on the outside of my house windows and on my car even when I am not driving it after being washed in the winter,  I have heard people living near the ocean complain of the same thing,Not everyone parks in a garage.Yeah , should of metioned i was looking to park it in my parents backyard (salt free but will be under 3 feet of snow). Clearly salt eats away at cars, but i guess the question more revolved around does mositure and snow and all that do anything? or is it purely the salt dirt and all other road crap thats shoots around you carMy guess is salt, outdoor car salt and snow was some rust after 17 years as a daily driver through salt muck and snow, the less salt the better my guess.Actually parking in a warm garage is worse than leaving it outside because anytime the temp rises above 32 F, the road salt starts eating bare metal. Parking it on grass or dirt is not as good as pavement, however.
So, again, no issues leaving it outside in the winter.Cool! appreciate your answer + beyond answer for future of car owning!!
thank you again for your competence in anything bumper to bumper and even aftermarkets as well! learned a lot from you in past 6 months. Couldn’t thank you enough dad always got dealership cars and sold them at warranty expiration so he doesn’t really know much about cars just where to bring it if something isnt right or if it needs oil lolI have known many people that put stepping stones under the wheels. My boat wheels seem to do fine, but it is a thought you might wish to consider.


 Blakensnake:

Parking on frozen ground shouldn’t be mush different than parking on pavement. During the spring thaw however the damp ground will keep the under side of your car damp, day and night. This won’t affect the painted surfaces but suspension, brake parts, nuts, bolts and rust spots will rust more than if you drove the vehicle through out the winter and parked on pavement.
I would much rather store a vehicle in a garage, as long as there is a roof it should be drier than storing the vehicle outside.


 VDCdriver:

So… why does anyone begin his/her sentences with the conjunction, “so”?

However, from a class action suit:
Lastly, though FCA has indicated the EGR cooler found in affected models, including the Dodge Ram 1500, is defective in 100 percent of vehicles equipped with the component, dealerships were advised by the defendant that “part supply is extremely limited,” and that the EGR cooler should be replaced only if the part has failed, the suit reads.

413,"Lubricant advice, Snowblower not car",General Discussion,55,1.2k,"So I bought a used Ariens snowblower  years ago. It has a wheel that slides across a shaft, like on a turntable to control speed and reverse as it goes to the other side of the rotating plate. Going to get it ready soon, but come cold temps the thing gets stuck and will not move so I am at whatever speed it is stuck in. 6 years of tries. Boat wheel bearing grease, fail, good cleaning and nothing fail, wd40 fail, lps fail, pb blaster fail, turbo oil fail. It is clean and shiny, but every time first snow stuck, no reverse or speed changes as it s stuck in place. Possibly graphite my next attempt. HELP PLEASE! I can pull a plate loosen it up, works one round and the next time fail. I hate having to do that in the cold and snow.Well for my Toro (most of them are all the same) it just says to lube once a year with auto engine oil.  That’s all I’ve done.  So I think you have a problem with either a sticky mechanism or the hub that is called a trunion for Toro anyway.  The hub of the disc.  I guess you really need to disconnect the shifter to see where the hang up is.  If the hub is shot, not sure what the price is, never changed anything except the rubber disc.  Problem is, I don’t think you can even get it off if you can’t get that wheel off that you foamed up.  Gotta be able to pull the shaft out.  Taryl has got a youtube on changing the wheel if I can find it, but has to be either a linkage sticking or the hub shot.
How To Replace A Drive Friction Disc On An Ariens Snowblower
Lubriplate.Here’s an additional thought.  Watch when Taryl pulls that shaft bushing out and it is worn.  He said that could cause intermittent loss of drive as the shaft wobbles.  Could it also cause the wheel to hang up?  Don’t know but something to check if they are all worn out.  Still probably have to get that wheel off though.  Might be time to just upgrade.You don’t say what year or size your Ariens is, I have a 1972 8hp.  They sold it as a 2 wheel tractor with sno -thrower attachment back then. Mine has a grease fitting on the shaft between the left wheel and the body of the machine when looking from behind, Greasing that fitting greased everything inside the housing that needs it.  I use a tube of chassis grease with moly in my grease gun. Mine has a full differential with a locking button on the left wheel.I will try and find lubriplate. @bing there are no bearings, just a square shaft and a wheel that moves along it. Controllers are fine, just not strong enough, a few whacks and it slides freely until the next use. @oldtimer_11 no grease fitting on the weel or shaft, all else has been lubed and works fine. Arens ST524  here is an image. the speed control moves the wheel along the shaft. this one would be in reverse, as the friction wheel moves to the right it adjusts the speed to forward and faster.  it closes down on a rotating disc.
The bearings/bushings are at each end of the hex shaft.  If that is yours, you might try using carb cleaner to clean all that gunk off the shaft, then just oil it and see how it works, but there has to be a bind somewhere.You are right, But I have cleaned it lubed it, leave it at 2 or 3 speed and that is where it sticks when it snows. Works fine in the garage until snow time. Just a generic picture. Speed and reverse is what it controls.


 Barkydog:

3 reasons for this: 1)Your drive plate(disc) is dirty.Clean with aerosol brake cleaner or acetone.
2) the friction disc rubber is getting thin(replace with new  one. 3) the drive plate has come loose due to vibration(put tread lock paste on center screw and fasten until tight. Hope this will helpI’m on my 3rd evap fan in my fridge. I know it’s cold, probably -10f on avg. why does it keep failing? The bearing is sealed. The parts come in box that says made in China. Thought they were good. I take it out and fan spins fine. It’s not seized. Yes, it is getting 120v.The wheel will not move when not engaged.I was told that the circuit board attachment for those fans was causing the failures.  The tech who told me refuses to repair them after repeated failed repairs.In addition I’d add that the shaft that the rubber drive wheel slides on looks pretty dicey with dirty grease and corrosion that could easily bind up when it’s under pressure.
Replace the whole assembly is your best option but if parts aren’t available, clean, polish and lube may get you a few more seasonsThat was a generic photo, 60’s now it is going to get cleaned and polished again. Probably a new mechanism would be good, will try again this year. @bing if hub is shot better go buy a new snowblower. Like I say clean it lube it works fine till it snows. Lubriplate as suggested by @old_mopar_guy will be my next try if I can find some locally.You can get it on amazonBarky, I just remembered that when I ran out of lubriplate, I successfully substituted white lithium grease.


 Barkydog:

The wheel will not move when not engaged.


Impossible to push or pull the blower right? I suggest you see this video  made for MTD snowblower,same principle with an Ariens.
How to Repair Stuck MTD snowblower drive system
The snowblower drives fine, speed change wheel gets stuck on the shaft, as I said I leave it in speed 2 or 3, it shifts fine changing speed or reverse in the garage, stuck when I need it for snow. In neutral wheel will not move, so I beat it into being able to slide, lubed it with all my thoughts, it drives fine, just got to release or employ the drive as needed when the wheel is stuck. Wanted lube ideas so the wheel does not get stuck on the shaft it slides on.Is the drive plate grooved out? If so the friction wheel will hang in the groove.It sticks on the shaft while not engaged, ie the wheel is clear of the plate. It will not move until I whack it, then have tried my best slippery things but the wheel sticks in place until I forcefully move it. it works fine in the garage until it snows and I need it, then it is stuck at whatever speed I have left it at, 2 or 3 usually just because I know it is going to happen. In leu of things I am thinking maybe a 6oo grit paper. moving the wheel back and forth over it on the shaft as it would be a pain to disassemble, and going to try some lubriplate as suggested by @old_mopar_guy

414,2008 Acura TL - Oil leak up front,Maintenance/Repairs,3,225,"i have a 2008 acura tl its leaking oil from front of engine any advice before i tear it downAre you talking about the front of the engine or the part of the engine that’s at the front of the car (which is actually the side of the engine since the engine is transverse-mounted)
If you’re talking about the real front of the engine and you intend to do this yourself, get a timing belt kit (the full one, with replacement pulleys and seals) and just do the job. If you’re gonna be tearing into it, you might as well replace the thing rather than having to tear it apart again later. Replace the water pump while you’re in there because it would suck to have to come back in a year or two and do the whole job again if the pump started to leak.
If you’re talking about the side of the engine, then it’s most likely that your valve cover seal is leaking. That’s a much easier job, so for your sake I hope that’s what you’re talking about. 
How many miles on the car?I would not do that without the factory manual or All Data for reference.  I got the 07 manual which they said was the same for 08 from HANDA for a bargain.  Doubt they still have them though.
Edit:  I looked at the manual and the seal is fairly straight forward once you get that far provided you can get it out and have the proper seal installation tool.  The timing belt etc. is a lot more complicated.  There is a reason they charge $700 to do it.Just in case this is not a leaking seal issue, you might check the oil pressure sending unit. Quite often with age and the beginning of winter the plastic on the sending unit can begin to fail around the crimp. Since this is pressurized motor oil a leak can get somewhat nasty.
If this is the case then it’s a cheap fix. Just something for consideration.
If this does turn out to be a crank seal issue then the crank journal should be inspected for a wear groove caused by the seal. If there is a groove then a Speedi-Sleeve is recommended to keep the new seal from leaking.",,,,
415,Likelihood of Honda Civic cracked engine blocks?,Maintenance/Repairs,32,26.0k,"What percentage of 2006-8 Honda Civics develop a cracked engine block (aluminum)?  I love my 2008 Honda, but reading about this possible defect worries me.  Any preventive steps to take?  Am I worrying needlessly?  I miss the NPR Car Talk show!Honda extended the warranty for as much as 8 years covering the coolant leak, so if you go to your local Honda dealer you could get the engine block or even the entire engine replaced free of charge (if you have a coolant leak).
There is nothing you can do, proactively to prevent it. Just keep an eye out for leaks. On Car Complaints.com 150, there were 48 cracked engine blocks of 596 complaints filed of about 400K cars sold. Pretty darn small!I don’t think Honda even knows what PERCENTAGE have cracked engine blocks. As others point out, Hinda has been normally good at issuing extend warranties for covering manufacturing defects.


 PaulLaRocca:

Any preventive steps to take?


Do what you can to avoid the engine overheating experience.  A single overheating experience can crack the block.   Monitor the dashboard coolant temperature gauge, and if it ever behaves abnormally, even if it isn’t overheating, even if it is lower than normal,  get the car to the shop.  Put a mark on the gauge where the normal operating temperature is.     Monitor the coolant level, and  replace the coolant with Honda approved coolant every 2 years.  If there’s ever any signs of coolant leaking, get that corrected right away.  Make sure the engine compartment fans are turning on when they should and doing their thing.   Does your car have an audio alarm if the coolant gets too hot?  If so, and you hear an alarm, pull over and turn off the engine asap.  If it is only a visual indicator for overheating, ask around if there’s a way to install an aftermarket audio alarm for coolant overheating.  And if you get an overheating experience even after doing all this, don’t try to cool it off by pouring cold water on a hot engine. Just let it cool off by itself.I just bought a 2006 Civic 1.8l and was wondering the same thing.  Honda sold over one million Civics in the affected years 2006 - 2008^ and there are 289 total complaints on carcomplaints, something like a .03% defect rate.  Yes not every cracked block is being reported but it’s a big enough deal so that quite a few would be.  But even if you said only 3% are being reported that’s still less than a 1% defect rate.  And only 9 reports so far in 2018 so you get the feeling most of the weak blocks have already failed and been dealt with so your chances of getting a crack are pretty slim now over 10 years in.
At any rate after doing a little research I’m not that concerned.  I still see a TON of 8th gen Civics rolling happily down the road every day so I’m guessing these cracked blocks are highly unusual and small in number.  Most owners probably aren’t even aware there’s an issue.  If Honda had to replace a million engine blocks they would go bankrupt and they seem to be doing just fine.  Non-issue.
^Yes I know a handful of 2009 were included in the TSB.  Only one complaint on carcomplaints so I left it out to keep from making the defect rate look even smaller.my recently purchased 2008 honda civic was leaking coolant so i brought it to the dealership today.  they diagnosed that the engine block is cracked and told me the warrantly expired 7 months ago.  they’re gonna call honda hq and get back to me after new years but fixing it could cost several g’s. FML!!!finally i got engine block crack on my Honda civic 2008  – with only 78k miles on it, local dealer quoted $3500 for the repair (replacing the engine)…Worked with honda over past 3 weeks, they were of no help, refused to do anything further. Given the age of the car only option for me is to scrap than spending 3500 on it,
Honda dont give any consideration of my long standing Honda loyalty (i owned 3 honda vehicles),and regular service history/oil changes etc… they just told this is outside of 10yr ext warranty…
Car was in very good running condition until this problem just popped up…Had spent almost 1200k on various recommended maintenance work in the past 1 year, hoping i could keep it for couple more years given the low mileage…no warnings, until one day coolant smell and overheating, stopped the vehicle, towed it to the dealer and just 3 weeks later I am looking for a scrap buyer… 
Anyone driving a Honda Civic out there from these defective VIN series, better get rid of your vehicle before this happens to you…while there are only a low % cars with these defects, it is not 100s but easily in many thousands… Honda conveniently will never disclose those numbers… They will not even respond to you in email or writing on these cases…
Most dealers i talked to in Houston areas have seen many cases of these, so nationwide you can guess how many could be there… I was thinking of low probability until this all happened. Don’t expect any sort of help from Honda as it is way past 10yr ext warranty…I am pretty sure a 2008 Civic with only 78,000 miles is worth more than $3500 if the rest of the car is in decent condition.  Also, I very seriously doubt you could buy a better, more reliable car for $3500 than what your Civic would be with a new/rebuilt engine.  You should think carefully before sending this one to the junkyard!Even with so few miles, I don’t expect any car company to warranty an 11 year old car.
What I wonder is why anyone would buy a used car without having it thoroughly checked by their mechanic, and doing research on known issues like this one.
If you aren’t prepared to do your homework before buying a used car, you might want to buy new. I know doing the research for known issues and getting a potential car checked by your mechanic at your cost can be a lot of work and a hassle, but you need to make the time if you’re going to continue to buy used cars.
Being a “certified used Honda” means almost nothing; it’s a marketing term. I’ve found issues with certified used cars that should have been spotted on even a cursory inspection, let alone a thorough one.I don’t see any references in the above posts about “certified” Hondas  or even that most of them were bought at Honda dealers.
People don’t get them checked out because nothing ever goes wrong with a Honda or Toyota…Right?


 oldtimer_11:

I don’t see any references in the above posts about “certified” Hondas or even that most of them were bought at Honda dealers.


Bases on the statements about loyalty to the brand, I thought that might be relevant without it being mentioned.I’ve repaired several of these engine block issues.  Its a simple repair, but it does involve some minor wrenching.  Since I go looking for instances that require wrenching, I dont mind this sort of thing.  But I can understand other non mechanics reaction to something that sounds so ominous.  The repair takes about 2 or 3 hours to perform, maybe longer because of meticulous prep, but…
Of the ones repaired in recent times (3 Honda’s 1 BMW, 2 Hyundai), none have had any issues further, its a shame this sort of thing happens, but…its more of a shame to give up on a very solid vehicle because the blocks develop hairline cracks in the water jacket on the front side of the engine (in Honda’s instance).  The hairlines weep coolant, you just drain the coolant, rinse the block out with water, prep and clean the areas (important) and then choose the material you wish to use.  No need for welding at all…  Its the prep that matters most in these instances.What’s the price tag when you do that job?
Could the $3,500 cost listed above be a case of a mechanic thinking he has to replace the block or replace the engine?
It doesn’t take much overheating to warp the head on a Civic. It can happen even if the temperature gauge doesn’t go into the red.What do you use as an alternative to welding?i see an 08 motor w/80k miles is around $450 in my area. i found a clean 08 e250 van than that needs a trans and the trans are higher. $600-800-1000? who knew


 Honda_Blackbird:

May I assume you’ve seen the repaired blocks several times since the repairs with your own eyes and know the repairs have held up?
Have the repairs held up a few years, at least?


 Honda_Blackbird:

Compared to a generic “cracked block” label, this precise description is, could it be said, comforting. Or, are there other locations where cracks have developed on these engines - locations that are impractical to repair?
My $50 1979 Toyota 4X4 had a crack in the left side of the 20R engine. It weeped coolant. I carefully dremeled the crack’s surroundings and cleaned it meticulously, then applied JB Weld. It never leaked again in the years I drove that truck. A broken frame was its demise.
“Cracked block” sounds like it’s all over. Not always.


 shanonia:

I carefully dremeled the crack’s surroundings and cleaned it meticulously, then applied JB Weld.


Which JB Weld product did you use?  These days, JB Weld is a brand, not a product.It was a 2-part epoxy/putty, gray in color when mixed. I have seen a fast-setting version since those days. I used the ordinary version. That was about 25 years ago.Of all the blocks that I have attempted repairs, I know all have held up over 2 years and still going.  One of the repairs I simply lost contact with because the fellow moved out of the area.  The issues in the Civic are a relatively minor (if you can call a block crack of any type minor) hairline cracks in the area of the front of the block where it has the webbing cast into the sides.  I guess the mold created thin areas here, and each Honda leaked in the same two places.
Here is a video of the same exact leaks (in the same exact places) encountered on a Civic.  A thorough prep and epoxy is what has worked thus far.  Of course the first one done was a Hail Mary, but it worked and I haven’t found need to go deeper than that… Yet.

416,2016 Honda Civic Sdn - Tire leak,Maintenance/Repairs,9,306,"Goodyear tires: does not hold tire pressureI see this problem several times a week and you don’t have to put up with this, punctured tires can be patched or replaced.Could be the rims or valve stems.If you spray soapy water over the tire, especially the bead area and the valve stem, you should see bubbles where it’s leaking, assuming the leak is severe enough.It would help if you said how long it takes to leak the air out or what you have even done about it . Something as simple as going to a tire shop .Thanks for sharing.If you are willing to do work yourself, take the tire off and inspect the tread. There may be a nail or screw stuck in the tire. If you don’t want to, maybe a friend will take the tire off and you two can inspect it together. Otherwise, take it to a mechanic or tire shop and see if it can be repaired. If it’s flat, you can put Fix-a-Flat or another tire repair liquid in it and then take it to a repair shop. If you use Fix-a-Flat, the tire needs it be deflated before you add it. We did that in a very slow leak on a rarely used car. The tire was flat, and after adding Fix-a-Flat the pressure was 17 psi.  Note that this method is temporary, and you really need to get it fixed or replaced. It’s only meant to get you to the tire store.Thank you all for the responses. This is not just one tire, it’s all the tires. The notice “low tires pressure” can pop up after only 6 days after adjusting the air in all tires to 32lbs. Other times it can be two to three weeks. Taken the auto back to dealer at least 6 times, the air is adjusted and then the pressure notice pops up within a couple weeks. In fact one tire in July flattened out, The dealer was near by, and even before he put the auto on the lift, he checked to see if he had a replacement. He then came back and stated there was a nail in the sidewall of the tire. I believe the auto tech banged a nail in the sidewall, in order to not blame the failure to the real problem. Last week one tire was 27, one 31 and both back tires were 30 after one week of adjusting the air to 32. I have informed the Honda Corp. they suggested to go to another Honda dealer for their opinion. (At $130.00 per hour)If you do use fix-a-flat as jtsanders suggested be sure to tell whoever fix’s the tire that
it is in the tire.If you still have the original tires they may simply be worn out. And I don’t know whether “dealer” refers to a tire store or a Honda dealer.",,,,

It always amazes me how many rich people that collect cars must be out there. Sure I have a bud with 6 corvettes, but in my mind I ask why. I suppose if I had the space and desire I could understand, I am old enough now I want to get rid of stuff.


 Barkydog:

how many rich people that collect cars must be out there


Not all car collectors are rich. Not all car collectors collect cars that are significant to the rest of the car world. I have a not-rich friend that owns a '55 Packard, a '90 Chevy pickup, a Corvette C7, a 2000 Camaro convertible, an unfinished 68 Camaro project car, and an '88 Olds Cutlass. Each is rarely driven. None are particularly significant to the car collector world but they are significant to him.
Some are rich, however. I volunteer at a car museum with 115 cars owned by one man. His total collection is maybe 125 cars or so. Many are one of a one, one of 3, the first of 22, ect. Most all run and are driven regularly. All are very significant to the car collector world.
I think it is sad the 280Z was never enjoyed the way it was designed to be enjoyed. An un-driven car is  just wrong, in my opinion.


 Mustangman:

My brother and SIL are friendly with a couple that owns a Packard and an Oldsmobile 88, both of which are of the '53-'54 vintage.   These folks are what I would call “financially-secure”, but not rich.  My relatives have never ridden in the Olds, but they have been treated to a couple of rides in that Packard, and they described it as “like gliding over the road while seated on a sofa”.

Agreed . . . cars are meant to be driven.  What’s the point of having a nice roadster, for example, if you store it with the top up all the time and never enjoy the open road?Wasn’t the 240Z the only good one?  Didn’t they just get heavier and less-manageable with the increases in engine size?The 240Z was the best but not the only good one. 260s and 280 are still good cars, though. The engine was the same family, just larger displacement.
The 280Zs had gotten heavier with more options but the extra 400cc helped that.Back in the 80s and 90s I used to work on a lot of Z cars before the herd started getting thinned out dramatically. One of the biggest problems I saw back then was that the availability of parts in the aftermarket and the price of those parts turned a lot of people off.
A distributor for 600 dollars and an A/C compressor (not to be had in the aftermarket) was 900 bucks at the dealer. That led to a lot of sticker shock and was a ton of  money 30 or so years ago.
Our local MAC tool man’s wife had a 280 with a failed A/C compressor and was in panic mode over the potential cost. They left the car with me for a week to see if I could figure out a workaround.
I discovered that if I removed the mounting bracket on the engine block and sawed a 1/2"" off of the rear that a Subaru SD-508 air compressor (110 dollars at NAPA) would bolt right on. Both high and low side compressor hoses would screw right on with no modifications at all as did the clutch wire connector. So they ended up with ice cold air for a comparative pittance. Go figure.
The MAC man was thrilled enough to cut me a whale of a deal on a new tool box now that his better half was cool and happy.


 RandomTroll:

Wasn’t the 240Z the only good one?


Of all the various Z cars over the years, I feel the 240Z was the best looking one, and the “purest” example



 RandomTroll:

Didn’t they just get heavier and less-manageable with the increases in engine size?


If you’re talking about the typical 280ZX from the 1980s, I agree . . . those almost seemed like luxury vehicles in my opinion, versus a simple sporty car



 ok4450:

Sounds like it was actually a Sanden ac compressor . . . ?!
A lot of our fleet’s large commercial vehicles and equipment still use Sanden ac compressorsYou are correct. They called them Sankyos back then but Sankyo/Sanden; the same thing.

Some car collectors got rich from their car collection.

Yup…and that’s why I couldn’t be a car collector. What I find funny are the guys that buy these cars and then donate them to a museum. At the Corvette Museum there’s more then one vette with less then 1000 miles and owned by a private collector that donated it to the museum to just sit there. I would never do that…but I am glad he did.Reminds me of that 57 Plymouth buried in Tulsa.  We were hoping to see a pristine car but just a bucket of rust.  Might have been a couple parts that could be salvaged but not much.  Unveiled by Boyd Codington before he died.
Thing is cars like to be driven.  A guy might have stayed in his house for 90 years but he is still 90 years old but with few miles.


 Bing:

Thing is cars like to be driven.


If this car had been driven it would have been scrap 30 years ago. There are a valued few that have survived over the years without the usual wear and restoration that are to be appreciated.
I have old cars that I have turned down offers many times, if I had sold them to hustlers that buy and sell cars only to be modified and crashed these cars would not be around today.On the other hand if that 57 would have been out on the street there might have been something left of it.  Rusty probably but still maybe rebuildable.  At any rate I was strongly considering driving to Tulsa just to see it but glad I didn’t.  What a disappointment.  Nice to have museum pieces too I guess, just don’t bury them.",,,,
423,Shocks bad…..or are they ok?,Maintenance/Repairs,13,341,"My Chevy Suburban with 51,000 miles doesn’t take bumps very well. We get a loud noise in the mid to the back if we go over a bump or over a rut in the road.    I took it to a mechanic who road tested it and after putting it up on the lift, said the rear shocks should be replaced…(For $1500 plus $150 labor!)
I took it to Firestone for a second opinion. Road test, lift…he said there is NOTHING WRONG WITH IT. Don’t need to do a thing!  Didn’t even charge me for his look!  He did say there is a lot of rust on the bottom of the car.
Who to believe? Do I need a third opinion?Yes a 3rd opinion would be good. If they are leaking replacement could be advised, from your description my first guess would be stabalizer links, exhaust clamps or heat shield, just an internet guess of course.$1500?  Are these special in some way? What year? I replaced my Suburban’s for a fraction of that.There may be something lose in the back, like a spare tire, for example.
Agreed that $1500 for new shocks, plus $150 labor, is a joke.Even if you have the electronic shocks, $1500 is too high. Replacement electronic shocks with air-lift springs are $500 for the pair.
Noises mean something is not attached too firmly. Not taking bumps very well could be shocks. But you haven’t told me enough about the Subby to render an opinion.  Year? Electronic shocks or regular? Did the first mechanic tell you the shocks were leaking? Did either find something loose?Neither said anything was loose. 2016 suburban. The mechanic said the car was ‘bottoming out’ when he did the test drive. My shocks came with the car when we bought it new. So I have no idea if they were regular or electronic. I still have the original paper work. I’ll look on the list of options and see if anything about shocks shows up. No one said anything about leaking. Firestone on the phone, without even seeing the car said two shocks would cost around $400 for the pair!I’d be REAL curious how that first shop came up with $1500.
Finding out where noise is coming from in the rear of a Suburban shouldn’t be too hard.  It would be surprising that a 2016 would need shocks.  Not impossible, but surprising.  What kind of roads do you drive on?  How bumpy?If there is nothing fancy about the shocks, I’d say the original shocks and the Subby have both worn in enough to give you a too loose ride. I found the same on my Chevy Avalanche with factory shocks. I replaced them at 60k miles or so with Bilstein Shocks. Much better ride and they have 80k miles on them and still work well. Not cheap, but not $1500 for all 4 either. About $5-600 for the set of 4.Was it $1500 for the rear or all four?
Bilsteins worked great on my Suburban.The OEM Magneride shock absorbers retail for $670 each.Seems to happen fair amount

424,Jeep kicks or misfires after driving to work,Maintenance/Repairs,6,181,"So my 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4.0L with 197,000 miles started acting up. When I drove to work a few days ago about 30 miles away my car was fine. But on the way back there was this flapping noise at idle and while driving. When I accelerated my car would start to kick and shake, but when I accelerated quickly it didn’t do. The check engine light was also flashing. When I got home the codes said it was engine misfire in the second and sixth cylinder. I changed the spark plugs and that didn’t fix it. So I changed the ignition coil and I thought it was fixed, drove fine all around town. When I drove to work it was great but when I drove home the problem came back. I shut the car off and turned it back on, it was a very hard start. It was also idling really rough and almost stalled out. I turned the car back on and kept going and the problem went away. Any ideas what it could be? Please helpCould be the fuel injectors for those cylinders. Could be those cylinders are worn out. What did the plugs look like when you replaced them? What color? Black and sooty or wet and oily?
Do you know how to run a compression test? That would tell you the condition of tne engine.image3024×4032 3.72 MBNo I don’t know how to run a compression testPlugs look worn but OK. Go on Youtube and find out how to run a compression test. But I am guessing fuel injectors at this point. Maybe fuel pump. But test, don’t just replace parts hoping to fix it.Could it be fuel injectors even though it only happens periodically?Yes, it could be intermittent injectors. A fuel pressure and supply problem would affect all 6. Ignition or injectors could affect one or 2 or 3. Looking at the firing order, 2 and 6 don’t share a coil so the wiring to the coil pack is probably OK.
Also make sure the throttle body is clean.
You could move injectors (with new O-rings) away from #2 into, say #3 and #6s injector to #5. If the misfire follows the injectors, then that confirms a bad injector or 2. Would really help to have long-term and short term fuel trims while the SUV is warmed up.",,,,

Click and Clack, the Tappet BrothersHi
One of the most memorable road trips was taken with my parents. My dad is an avid listener. We were in PA and my mom was backing the car with the boat attached down the boat ramp. My brother and I had just gotten out of the car, we were about 8 and 10 at the time. I remember my dad saying, do not step on the brake until I tell you and my mom stomping on the brake and saying “WHAT?, I CAN’T hear you!” My brother and I were then mortified that at that moment the boat (which was blue) decided to dislodge itself from the trailer and slide off onto the cement. It was a steep boat ramp!
Was my dad mad!! “I told you NOT to step on the brake” he yelled at my mom. Then they proceeded to get into some sort of argument.
My brother and I stood there stunned that now the car and trailer were on the hill and so was the boat, nowhere near the water. We figured at that point in time someone was going to get in trouble so we stayed quiet (not usually the first choice we made). We also made a bet at that point if we would ever get home and if it would be with both parents.
So, my dad who was really mad and my mom who felt really bad both stood there deciding what to do. In the end my dad ended up winching the boat back onto the trailer. I think he was so mad that he made it look easy. Neither one was talking to the other which was not a good thing.
After the boat finally got into the water we did go boating.
The same trip was the camping that it rained and the tents were flooded for most of our trip.
This was one of the very memorable trips taken with my parents, a boat, camping and rain!
My parents have many very funny car things. That also include the time my mom lost the brand new muffler from the 65 mustang on the freeway and refused to go pick it up because of all the traffic. My dad was mad because he had just put it on a few weeks before and it was new!
Or the time the hood of the car flew up, broke the front window (I was about 5 in the front seat at the time), and then flew off and she went back and picked it up and stuffed it in trunk of the car so my dad would not be mad that she did not pick up the parts that fell off the car! My dad was so shocked that she could lift up the hood. She is about 5’4"" and 100lbs but she said it is easy when you are mad enough!Not sure what happened to my original posting, as I clicked the “preview” button and saw someone else’s post below mine, then mine disappeared. I am possibly resubmitting my story, “Thirteen People in a Chevy Nova for 4 1/2 Hours.”It was a dark and stormy night.  No, really, it was!  An older brother of mine and I were headed to the lake from Chicago to western Michigan.  We were going to help trim some trees at my future Father in Laws weekend cabin.  Not only was it dark and stormy, it was freezing cold, November in the upper midwest…  My car died on the interstate and we pulled over.  There were no apparent service stations near and no means of finding one.  (This was 40 years ago…no cell phones)  I spotted a semi tractor trailer rig a few hundred feet ahead, pulled over and the 2 guys were picking up the road flares and reflectors.  I told my brother, why don’t you stay with the car, I’ll catch a ride with these guys and bring help.  He said “go for it”.  I ran up to the truck and spoke to the two men, explained our circumstances and asked if I could ride with them to the next exit.  They said “sure” and went back to work for another 10 minutes.  They climbed in the truck and didn’t say anything to me, so, young and foolish fellow that I was, I hopped on the running board/step on the right side of the cab.  I assumed they knew I was there, on the outside of their cab and were going to drive slowly to the exit and allow me to hop off.  Pretty soon we were doing, maybe, 60 miles per hour and it was clear that they had forgotten about me altogether.  I started pounding on the window and the rider rolls down the window with schock on his face and expressed that sentiment with his exclamations.  They immediately slowed down and pulled over, apologizing all the time, and dropped me off at what was now a few exits up the highway.  I found a service station at the exit, it was closed.  I called the emergency number on the door from the pay phone, they owner came out, replaced my fuel filter and we were on our way.  The 2 hour drive became a 4 hour drive, but I lived through it and we arrived safely at our destination…  So, do YOU think they knew I was “out there”?Dear Tom & Ray,
Dang, I have always wanted to tell this tale to the world, and you guys are the ones!
When I was about 12 years old, living at Holloman AFB, N.M., my 10 year old sister and 14 year old brother and I took a short vacation with our mom and stepdad. We went to all the Old West tourist places, Tombstone,AZ, etc.
At one point, I was sitting in the right rear passenger seat, my sister in the middle and my brother on the left. We had stopped to visit some amazing (I’m sure)attraction, and my mom and stepdad were (as usual) arguing about wether to get out of the car or not…I understood we were getting out, so I opened the door. As we began backing out! OPPS! The door hung on a telephone pole, bending it almost all the way forward. This was my first experience with “suicide doors”.
Oh, did I mention this was in 1965 and we were in a BRAND NEW Buick station wagon? The fan was hit with you know what, and my brother and sister and I spent the rest of the vacation with a rope tied from the left door, across the front of us, and tied to the right!
A VERY quiet ride home, to say the least.
Thanks for all the fun you guys,
EricMy memorable road trip was when I helped my friend move from Atlanta Georgia to San Jose California via Los Angeles.  We rented the largest Ryder truck they had.  Loaded all of his furniture and his Nissan truck in the back of the Ryder.  We were also pulling a 19foot boat.  We wanted to go thru Los Angeles because we had never been to the Pacific coast.  We were sitting right in front of Beverly Hills Hotel, waiting on the light to turn green.  We were trying to turn right onto Sunset Blvd and had to make a really wide turn to avoid taking out the corner signs with the boat trailer.  During the wide turn…a Jeep thought he would squeeze between us and the corner…and my buddy ended up hitting his front left fender with the right side boat trailer fender.  The boat trailer fender was pushed into the tire and was rubbing…so we stopped right there on Sunset Blvd.  The Jeep’s driver, got out all mad.  Me and my buddy, being from Georgia, have strong southern accents.  The only thing I could figure was that Californians have heard stories about Rednecks…because as soon as we began to speak, he changed his tune and said everything was fine and jumped back in his Jeep and drove off.  We must have held up traffic for at least 30 minutes trying to bang out the trailer fender from the tire.  People in Beverly Hills aren’t very patient.  I’ve still got the photo I took of the Beverly Hills Hotel…right before we made the turn.  The trip has left me with many good memories.My mother-in-law was a good sport.  She didn?t complain about my driving, or my husband?s for that matter.  She was just happy to go along for the ride.  And she was pretty good about being on the receiving end of a good prank.  We used to have some adventures?one was the ?errand from hell.?  It was a cold winter day?I think it was in 1998.  My mother-in-law had some serious health problems, and one of her challenges was living with diabetes.  She lost part of her left leg, and the disease affected her eyesight.  So that day, I took her to the eye doctor for a check.  The temperature dropped, so after her appointment, I took her to lunch.  When we were done, a bad snowstorm was underway.
We live in Washington, D.C.  Now, everyone knows that Washingtonians aren?t always the most proficient drivers in the snow (unless you?re a Midwestern transplant, and then you are obliged to openly mock us).  Basically, we panic, strip the grocery store shelves of the holy trinity of supplies to necessary ride out a snowstorm?bread, milk, and toilet paper.  But I digress.
So Eleanor (my mother-in-law) and I hop into my husband?s 1987 Chevy Blazer and start the arduous journey home (icy and snowy streets, no snow plow or treatment).  We?re about a ? of a mile into our journey, and the truck dies.  Oy.  So I get out of the car, look under the hood?like I know what I?m doing (although I am a firm believer in sexual equality, there are certain household responsibilities that fall under the purview of gender?car maintenance is my husband?s kingdom).  Enter the good Samaritan.
The good Samaritan tells me that he?s a mechanic, and he wants to help the stranded women on the side of the road.  He pokes around under the hood, and finds out that my husband has a can of ?Engine Start? in the truck.  Let?s just say that I found out later that ?Engine Start? is highly flammable when applied and the carburetor backfires.  But I?m ahead of the story.
Mr. Samaritan asks me to start the truck while he applies the ?Engine Start.?  Next, the engine combusts and there?s a raging fire.  Mr. Samaritan begins to use a rag to try and smother the fire, but ?Engine Start? is on the rag.  So, it?s ?Rag Start? too, eh?  Panicking, I get out of the truck, take off my snappy winter cap and try to pound out the flames.  Then I notice my mother-in-law, still strapped in the passenger?s seat, trying to get out of the truck.  I drop my cap (which is now also on fire), and haul tail over to the passenger side, rip open the door, take off her seat belt, and proceed to carry her (hopefully) a safe distance from the truck.  But wait!  Her wheelchair?s in the truck and threatened by the inferno.  So I hightail it back to the truck, pull out the wheelchair, slap her in it, and race up the street!
By the time I can refocus on the truck, Mr. Samaritan doused the fire.  I guess he gave up on the rag technique.  I was pretty happy that all?s well that ended well.  My husband?  Not so much.  Lessons learned?


Before letting a Samaritan work on your car, always ask if he is a shade tree mechanic or a licensed mechanic (and not by Budweiser).


?Engine Start? bad.


Mr. Samaritan, well meaning, but not so much.

Picture if you will. Orlando Florida, 1986. I just bought a 1979 MG Midget from my landlord. The coolest little car ever. I decided to take a 30 mile solo trip to the beach to celebrate my new purchase. I drove it to Canaveral National Seashore, my favorite spot. Beautiful clear day, top down. I was in heaven. While at the beach, I decided to take a walk and left my belongings unattended. Upon my return, I was horrified to find that someone had gone off with my stuff. Everything! My flip flops, t-shirt, Heineken beach umbrella, my shorts, (I was wearing a lime green Speedo swimsuit; which was allowed, because I was in shape and in my early 20’s, and it was the 1980’s.) Luckily, I had my wallet & car keys in my car and was able to drive home. But here is where the nightmare begins. Half way home, on busy highway 50, I got a flat. I had a spare, but the road was   unbearably hot. I had no flip flops, no beach towel, no shorts or shirt. Just me & my lime green Speedos. I had to do something. Searching around, I found a pair of Shiny black cowboy boots behind the passenger seat. (probably belonging to the previous owner, my landlord.) I put them on and began changing the tire. (Front driver’s side facing the road, of course!) People were honking horns and slowing down. Nobody stopped to help! I looked like a freak. Thank God it was in a time before cell phone cameras and the internet. I know it would have been a huge hit on YouTube to see a guy in lime green Speedos and black cowboy boots changing a tire on a busy highway.
To this day, every time I go to the beach, I keep a complete outfit in the trunk of my car and I no longer wear Speedos. I have surpassed the “Speedo limit”, if you will, which, in my opinion is 25.
Orlando from Orwell, VTMy dad was in the service so, my family traveled quite a bit between postings. We had plenty of bad road trip experiences, but probably the worst occurred while en route to Fort Huachuca, Ariz.
Dad was driving our Ambassador station wagon, packed with many belongings, Mom, the three boys, our dog – and the damn cat. We’d made it from Mississippi to the middle of the Arizona desert virtually crisis free, when a monsoon-like rainstorm opened up. Sheets of rain pelted the car, making it almost impossible to see.
Then, the cat began to howl. At first, we thought he was just scared. But, on closer examination, his body language made it clear that he had to go – and the launch window was going to be measured in seconds, not the several minutes that it would obviously take for the storm to pass.
There was only one solution: Someone would have to hold a litter box while Thomas took care of business. Guess who? Why, Mom, of course! She quickly snatched a box, filled it with litter and positioned it under the cat as he made his deposit.
I have no idea what that cat had been eating, but what he produced could easily be classified as a weapon of mass destruction. And, there we were, trapped in the Ambassador, a torrent raging outside. Of course, our discomfort was only collateral damage. Mom took the bullet.Well.
At the time I was going to school in Erie, PA where we get lake effect snow and ice from October to April and everybody knew how to drive in bad weather.  Two alumni from the school were getting married and a bunch of us were bridesmaids/groomsmen in the wedding and we had to drive to Oklahoma where all of this was taking place.  It was January of 2007, and if you recall, a major ice storm was sweeping through Midwest.
We were an hour away from our destination when we got a call from the bride.  “Turn around.” she said, “the pastor’s flight is canceled, the resort for the wedding is closing down and we’re just going to get married in the courthouse today.”  We were already so close we told her we’d meet them at the courthouse, so we got there just before they closed for bad weather and our friends got married in jeans and printed tshirts that said “Joe the Groom” and ""Macy the Bride""
All of that was great fun and exciting, we ate the rehearsal dinner and used it as the reception, we dressed up in our wedding finery and went driving around looking for a restaurant that was still open, and played Air Soft in the hotel hallways all night.  In the morning we packed up and headed back for PA, counting the cars that were stopped on the side of the road.  We were number 32.
In all of our laughing and mocking of the Midwesterners who knew nothing about driving in ice, the hood of our ancient Mercedes Benz froze over and blew the head gasket and we were stuck on the side of the road in Missouri.  Go figure.
We got towed to a Pep Boys in Springfield where we combed the phone books for churches who might take us in considering that we had no money.  Then one of the cashiers said she went to a college there and we could stay in the dorms there.
We spent the entire next day in the cafeteria trying to find the parts to fix the car, but nobody had them or if they did it would take weeks to get them.  We even tried calling around to see if anyone would buy the car for scraps to get us money to take a bus home.  The real problem was that even if we had money, they were declaring a National emergency and nothing was going in or out of Springfield at all.  We finally got another friend to drive the whole way down from St. Louis and take us to Erie, I think the guy that owned the car had his dad go get it from Michigan.  All in all, it was the most memorable wedding I’ve ever been to and absolutely the craziest road trip I’ve ever been on!
Beth from Gettysburg, PAMy husband, my 18 month old son and I were on the way home, home was Wyoming at the time, from his grandfather’s funeral in New Mexico. Our car at the time was a '77 Chevy Malibu, this beast was older than I was. We were students at UW and we were as broke as only married students can be. We have enough money to drive our gas guzzler down there and back. We were following my father in law, in a (slightly) newer car that had A/C, since it was August and I don’t do well in the heat, my son and I rode with him. My father in law is a true Wyoming cowboy and to pass the time on this long HOT drive, he was listening to his favorite music, yodeling. I tried to fake sleep, hoping he would turn it off, but nope, he started singing along with it. So I gave up on the fake sleep and tried to engage him in conversation. I was following our route on a map because at Moab, Utah, we were going to head back across Colorado, and he was going to go north to his home. We only had an inch on the map before I could escape the yodeling and get back to my own, quiet, sweltering car. As we continue on the road, Route 666 South, I swear I am not making that up, I notice that outside is getting drier and we have not yet hit a sign that says “Welcome to Utah.” I kept saying to my F-I-L, “We really should be there by now, we only had about 50 miles and we aren’t there, shouldn’t we stop and see where we are?” My father in law is just happy to have someone to listen to how much he has been practicing his yodeling. We finally, 3 hours later get to a town, and it isn’t Moab. We had missed a turn off and the ONLY reason we stopped was because the car got a flat. He would have been happy to continue, soon we would have needed passports. We stopped at a mechanic shop and heard the mechanic trying to explain to a customer that the alternator needed to be replaced because it was making too much electricity. So we finally get out of the car and my F-I-L notices that we were too far south, huh, maybe we missed the turn off. I am trying to control myself, when he says, “oh good! you can hear the other tapes I have!”, all yodeling. So not only do we have to continue listening, we took a 6 hour detour. We finally get to Moab, by this time we have been driving for 12 hours and we have another 10 to go. My poor son is about to lose his mind and we don’t have money for a hotel. My F-I-L waves goodbye and rides off into the sunset, literally singing, and we try to make it back home. We had to stop at about 2 AM because neither one of us could see straight anymore and we slept for about and hour and finally got home. It took almost a week before we could get my son to get back into the car, and I truly believe that there will be yodeling in hell.Hi:  I have many road trips from hell but this one is by far the worst.  In June 08, I took my Rav4 to the dealer to get a tuneup for a road trip to Pa. I live in Tennessee. At this time, they removed the passenger side air filter from behind the glove box and found 3 small baby mice and a mother mouse.  I must add that when I was driving to the dealer, I looked down and saw a mouse walking on the floor passenger side.  I screeched to the side of the road but, of course, I could not find the mouse.  So they put the baby mice in the field and literally tore my car apart trying to find mom.  They assured me that they had.  Yea, right.  I arrived in PA and the weather was cool.  In one day it was in the 90’s.  I opened the car door and the smell was absolutely awful.  I took apart the filter but could not find the mouse.  My sister and I had many trips planned so we had to ride with the windows down in the heat with her holding a burning incense stick.  This went on for a week.  I have a carcazized skeleton in my cooling and heating system that someday maybe found by auto archeologists.Submitting my story: 30 Hours of Hell, the tale of how, 14 years ago, I drove from South Carolina to New York City on a moment’s whim, alone and without true directions.
It was… an interesting journey.My wife and I, and our three young children, were taking a trip through West Virginia in our 1973 Volvo pulling a small tent trailer. The mountains were not steep, so the road was straight down the mountain and straight up the next mountain. I coasted down the mountain, then at the bottom of the valley, I shifted into a lower hear and floored the accelerator to start our long path up the mountain in front of us. I soon noticed that there was no resistance when pressing on the accelerator. In fact, when I put my shoe beneath the accelerator, I could lift it, and then it would flop back to the floorboard. What? How could this be?! I tried that again, with the same results. Obviously the accelerator was not attached to the engine. Oh oh. The engine was at full throttle, so I couldn?t put in the clutch to shift, or the engine would blow up. Luckily for us, the steepness of the mountain was perfect, so the car neither gained speed nor slowed down. Here we were, in the middle of nowhere, riding in a run-away car. Now what? I knew that when we finally stopped, I had to shut off the engine and coast to a stop, without shifting gears and without being able to restart the engine if we stopped with part of the car or trailer on the roadway.
God was with us. As we were going up the mountain wondering where we could pull off the road, a road-side fruit and vegetable stand appeared on our side of the road. I tried hard to gage the speed and momentum of the car and trailer, and then at the appropriate time, I turned off the engine and coasted into the small space in front of the fruit stand, where, fortunately, there were no other cars.
The only toilet was an outhouse, and there was no running water. After my wife and children used the outhouse, my wife bought bananas, thinking that by peeling the bananas, this would be the cleanest fruit at the stand.
When I looked under the hood, and then under the dashboard, I found the accelerator cable had broken where it entered a metal tube through the firewall. The broken end of the multi-strand cable was frayed, so it stuck in the metal tube. We were in the middle of nowhere, so the monkey was on my back to fix this problem. I looked in the trunk, where I keep tools and some items in case of an emergency (this incident qualified). I found a new roll of picture hanging multi-strand wire that happened to be about the same diameter as the accelerator cable. I pulled out the broken cable and inserted the picture hanging cable into the metal tube and through the firewall. I tied the new cable around the appropriate link beneath the air cleaner, and the other end was tied to a hole at the back of the accelerator pedal.
It worked! The engine started and the speed could be controlled. After thanking the owners of the fruit and vegetable stand for the use of their facilities, we continued up the mountain. The next day we passed a Volvo dealer where I purchased a new cable. The Volvo dealer?s service department couldn?t install our new cable until a week later, so we drove home to Minnesota with my fix, and then I installed the Volvo cable.
Keep a roll of picture hanging multi-strand wire in your car?s trunk!Talk about a road trip gone bad, I have one for you.
We had arranged to spend some time in the Smokey Mountains and hike to a lodge at the top of Mount LaConte for an over night stay.  It was probably the hottest day of the summer when we left on our trip from Kalamazoo, Michigan.  We were driving a full size wagon and pulling a pop up camper.  We were half way between Fort Wayne, IN and Lima, OH when the first incident happened.  Steam start pouring out of the engine compartment.  Fortunately we were coming up on a rest area so I pulled in.  I knew immediately what was wrong and was mentally kicking myself in the posterior.  I knew we had a weak radiator hose and had meant to replace it before the trip.  But I got busy and forgot about it.  There was a pin hole leak in the hose right next to the connection.  I was able to cut the hose and re-clamp it.  After filling the radiator with water we were on our way again.  We stopped in Lima, OH to purchase a new hose and radiator fluid.
The second incident happened when we had just gotten on the express way in Lima.  A car pulled up next to us and mouthed the words “flat tire” and pointed to the trailer.  Fortunately we were just coming up on an exit so I pulled off the express way and into a vacant parking lot.  Sure enough the tire was flat.  I don’t think the tires had ever been off the camper so I struggled for a long time loosening the lug nuts.  Did I mention that the temperature was about 105 degrees in the shade.  After much struggling and some appropriate language I was able to replace the tire.  By now I was hot, and dirty and tired.  I asked my wife to drive so that I could get a little rest.
We had just past Dayton, OH when the third incident occurred.  I was dozing off when I felt a jolt that was more than just a bump in the road.  My wife yelled that we had been hit.  In a split second I realized that we were already spinning out of control so I yelled back “Hit the brakes”.  The car and trailer jack knifed, spun out of control and down a grassy embankment.  We were fortunate in that we did not hit anything on our way down the embankment and that the car stayed upright.  The only injury that occurred was when my wife’s legs hit the steering wheel.  The trailer came loose from the hitch and was lying on its side.  It had been totaled.  The person who had caused the accident had stopped by the side of the road.  He was drunk.  He had fallen asleep while driving and hit the corner of the trailer.
Even though a lot of bad things happened that day, the good news was that no one (my wife, nor our two boys nor me) suffered any serious injury.  We managed to settle the insurance claim on the trailer, get the wheels on the car repaired and continue on our journey to the Smoky Mountains.  We made good on our reservations at the lodge on Mount LaConte but had to forego the rest of the vacation.
That’s the story of our road trip gone bad.
Dave BarryWhen we were little New York kids, we drove from Long Island to St. Petersburg, FL every year. Both parents are from the south, and my Dad has an invisible friend named “Y’all.” We figured it was the stress of his job as an FBI man. Someone had evidently threatened his life just before this particular trip (circa 1963) and he took the threat very seriously. We were unaware of this, of course.
We were driving through the farm country- I think it was Pennsylvania, and the folks had given us each an egg of Silly Putty to keep us quiet (there were four of us kids.) Having copied comics, made funny shapes, we searched for a new use for the goop. We decided to blow bubbles with it. You flattened the gob over your mouth, and slowly blew on it trying to make a bubble. My sister was the first one to be successful. The sound that it made when it popped sounded exactly like the ricochet of a bullet. “BEEEEEUW!”  It was loud.
Thinking that someone was shooting at our non-air-conditioned, 1958 Ford Station Wagon (IN AUGUST!) my father screeched “Y’all get down!”  With that, he pulled off the road, and started barrelling through somebody’s field at about 90 miles per hour. My father had never raised his voice, and never broken the law that says you must keep your car out of fields. We were shocked. Once again, he screamed, “Y’all get down!”  With that second demand, we figured that if Y’all was supposed to get down, we’d better get down, too.  We all dropped down, and got in the bottom of the car, in front of the backseat.  We were terrified, and figured that he had gone insane because of the pressures of the job. My mother was hollering, we were screaming, yet, Y’all had said nothing. One more bit of proof that Daddy REALLY needed this vacation.
Eventually, after barrelling through the field, which was like driving over a large washboard, we emerged on another road. Daddy had escaped the hail of bullets that he evidently expected.
It wasn’t until 30 years later that he found out that it was Silly Putty. By this time, we’d lived in Florida since 1967. We knew who y’all was. When we told him, his incredulous response was, ""That was Y’ALL???""
I think that the trip marked him…First year after college my car was a 1970 VW Bus purchased in the rust belt Finger Lakes Region of NY state. How rusty was it? I got in one morning and it wouldn’t start. I walked to the back to look at the engine and saw the battery hanging from one wire having fallen through the rusted out compartment. Solution? A board. It  taught me how to work on engines (what was that book? How to keep your VW alive, a guide for the complete idiot?) and to use a pop riveter.
I was working at WGVA AM doing the morning news. I had to work a half day Christmas eve and got off Christmas day. My folks lived in Wilmington, DE - usually a six hour drive.  I left at 1pm and arrived in Wilmington at 11:30pm.
I drove through a blinding snow and ice storm.  The bus actually was a great snow car in terms of traction,  but I had a hole in the floor by the brake and gas and the fan moved hardly any air.  I remember taking off my winter coat and putting my feet through the arms to try and keep them warmer and until I got south of Scranton/Wilkes Barre I had to lean forward and peer out of the only section of windsheild I had - a softball sized clearing just above the defroster.
It was nice to see the fam for Christmas morning but had to leave in the afternoon of Christmas day to get back north and go to work the following morning.  The drive back was far easier but concentration required during the trip down was exhausting.It was a hot July weekend in North Platte, Nebraska. I was scheduled to attend my Army Reserve Drill the second weekend in July, 2000 in Omaha, NE 278 miles away. My two youngest children, ages 7 and 12 accompanied me as we left North Platte Thursday evening headed for the Missouri River near Yankton, SD, for a mini camp -out vacation in my 1985 VW Vanagon before driving to Omaha for my weekend drill on Friday.
We left North Platte early afternoon on Thursday and arrived at our campground near the beach at the Gavins Point Dam, 275 miles down the road, late that evening.
Waking the next morning, I noticed some fluid on the asphalt under the engine compartment that concerned me, however after enjoying the morning playing in the water on the banks of the Missouri river; we left for Vermillion, SD, about 25 miles away where I had attended college.25 years ago.
We were lucky to make it that 25 miles to Vermillion as I heard the familiar sound of my water pump going bad in my Vanagon.  Stuck in Vermillion, SD until I could get the water pump replaced I proceeded to retrieve my spare pump out of the back of the van and began to replace it. Unfortunately, the first bolt head on the pump broke and my DIY water pump project was history.
The nearest VW dealer was 60 miles away in Sioux Falls, SD where I had the Van towed with my children and me in the tow truck. Since I wasn?t going to make it to my weekend Army Reserve training, and had 3 days find a way home for myself and two young children. A one-way car rental across state lines was not allowed, the ?Greyhound Bus? option was a multi-day event.
Then, I remembered the 57 Chevy on E-bay that had looked at the previous week that was located in Mankato, Minn. There were no bids and I inquired about the vehicle and the beautiful ?Dusk pearl?, 4-dr that was built in Wisconsin. They seemed to be willing to deal a little on the reserve price listed on E-bay so I thought to myself, this was our  ride home.
Now, how do I get myself and two children to Mankato by Saturday to test drive the car and pay for the car. Complaining to a substitute Taxi Driver in Sioux Falls after dropping off my Vanagon at the VW dealer, abou",,,,
 the rental car restrictions he said, he?d call dispatch and see if he could take us to Mankato, Minnesota, 175 miles away. Dispatch said no problem as long as I paid cash and I gave him the $175.00 cash (nearly everything I had) for the one-way fare and we were off on another adventure,,,,,,
Arriving in Mankato, late that night and while en-route finding a motel room next to the dealership with only one room left due to a local softball tournament. The room was over $100 but it was one of the last left in town and we were exhausted from all of the traveling that day; I gave the motel my credit card number just as my cell phone battery died in the Taxi en route to Mankato, Minn.,,,,,,,
The next morning I inspected and test drove the 57 chevy while the kids slept in the Motel across the street.  The car was much nicer than the pictures on E-bay revealed, all stock, matching numbers and better than I wanted for my ?daily driver?. But, it was our only ticket home that weekend.,,,,,,
By 11 am the paperwork at the dealership was done and I drove the car across the street to the motel. The kids were still sleeping. I woke them up and by noon we were on our way back home, a two-day drive,,,,,,,,
The kids saw the car as we walked out to the parking lot. They exclaimed, ?Dad, look at the cool car over there?, not knowing that it was the car we were using to get home that weekend. We walked over to the car, I opened the door, put the key in the ignition and said, ?lets go, it?s our ?cool car?,,
Never having owned a 57 Chevrolet, I encountered my first dilemma at the gas station across the street where I decided to fill up before leaving Mankato. Embarrassed at not being able to find the gas cap, I asked my 12 year old to get the original owners manual out of the glove box and find out where the ?gas? goes. The problem was solved by the owner?s manual. We were on our way home.,,,,,,,
That was nine years ago and nearly 55,000 miles later and my 12 year-old son is now the primary driver of the vehicle that gets used every week and has never seen the inside of a garage, even while I spent most of 2007 in Baghdad, Iraq, interrupting my garage building project that is almost finished. Our highway adventure will come full circle in 2010 when I drive the 57 Chevy into a garage for the first time.My husband and I took a trip to the Southwest in 1978 in a 72 Chevy Impala that had about 84,000 miles on it.  Before the trip we had the car serviced for the trip and bought four new tires for it.  All went well until we arrived in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  In pulling into the motel, the muffler fell off.  Next day it was replaced.  We arrived in Albuquerque ane the air conditioner had to be fixed.  One of the tires developed a bulge in Gallop, NM requiring a new tire.  We toured the canyons and had started to return to Pittsburgh via Colorado.  In Pueblo the engine quit due to a rocker arm failure.  It was replaced. In the middle of Iowa on a Saturday late afternoon two more rocker arms blew.  A great mechanic came in on Sunday and replaced them just so we could continue our trip.  In Dayton, Ohio another tire blew…it seems that all the new tires were defective.  We were lucky in many ways because service places were all around when the trouble happened and not in the desolate canyon environs.I’ve taken 3 road trips from Indiana heading west.  The idea was to take state roads to see the country.  Each had their issues:
#1) Passengers were mother and 2 boys (9 and 11).  I did not have a DVD player and each had to have their own seat so they couldn’t “touch each other”.  My suburban has a 42 gallon gas tank and both boys panicked in the desert when the gas tank was under 1/4 tank.  I just laughed.  I was pointing out the mountains and splended scenary and the boys just talked about trucks on the highway.  After a while the boys needed to get their “energy” released.  A small park was found and I stopped and told them to run it out.  Apparently their energy was gone because they didn’t want to.  I needed time away from them.,,,,,,,,,
#2)  Moral…do not travel 5000 miles with a 16 year old boy when his girl friend is still in Indiana.  Luckily a cell phone was available and the bill had 2 sheets of logged calls.  Secondly, when the air conditioner compressor freezes when it is engaged, removed the power so when a rain storm creates fog on the windows turning the defroster on, the fan belt is not burnt up by the air conditioner compressor while parked in a rest area in the middle of the only 2 towns in North Dakota.,,,,,,
#3  Thinking a Jeep Wrangler would be nice to drive west, not thinking much about the 12 gallon gas tank.  There is a highway 12 in Idaho where a sign indicates that the next gas station is 72 miles down the road.  I looked at the gas gage and quessed that there would be enough gas, I went on.  72 miles and winding mountainous roads later caused a panick on the gas supply front.  Finally, a town appeared and gas was purchased at the mountain lion and bear check station.  Highway 101 down the Oregon coast is beautiful, until someone pulls out into your lane and waiting (which seemed like an eternity) for the sound of vehicles touching.  25 foot skid marks later the nerves are gone.  The Jeep was not touched…dinner was needed.,,,,,

426,2006 Honda Pilot - engine light?,Maintenance/Repairs,9,351,"Picture of engine on dash .owners says emission problem or gas cap?As usual this is a vague post so it is impossible to know why or what you actually asking.
I don’t like to guess but here goes.  I assume you are thinking of buying this vehicle.  The logical thing to do is tell them to fix the problem that has turned on the Check Engine Light and then call you.
Check Engine Light on I always just leave and look else where.That’s your check engine light. If it’s on solidly the vehicle needs repairs. If it’s flashing, pull over and shut it off immediately. When the check engine light comes on the car’s computer usually stores a code that can help track down the problem. Have a good mechanic scan the code and tell you approximately what’s wrong and what it will take to fix it.The part about ( owners say ) leads me to think that this is not the OP’s vehicle and until they can make a logical question why bother with this .The buyer should be careful. A check engine light can be erased without solving the problem. If owner claims it was fixed, get the repair report.I originally thought “owner” referred to the Owner’s Manual. Apparently not. I’m continually amazed by ads on CraigsList with something along the lines of “should be an easy fix.” If it were an easy fix, you would’ve fixed it yourself and been able to sell a working unit. By the same token, if the vehicle in question just needed a gas cap the seller would have replaced it by now so obviously there’s a more serious problem.I have identical problem. If youfind the answer let me knowI’m sure you do. That’s your post that you responded to. If you can provide mor info, maybe we can help you.As you’ve already been told, if we’re going to make any guesses here, you need to retrieve the code and let us know what it is.I think the owners reference is to the owners manual, which the OP simply didn’t bother to type out in full.",,,,

429,2014 Honda Accord - Sell/Trade - Buy Used Car In Place,Buying/Selling,28,790,"Hello!  New here and would definitely classify myself as Knucklehead when it comes to cars.
I have a 2014 Honda Accord EX , just over 71,000 miles.  With all the wear, repair and tear, etc., KBB offered just over $8000 for the cash offer deal where I go into a dealership, and likely is never the case yadda yadda.  I owe just over $9000 for the car.
What I would like to do, in an ideal world, is get rid of my Honda and get another car for equal or lesser value of what I owe ($9000) in it’s place.  Still in my ideal imaginary world, I would drive this car, pay it off in a year and drive for maybe another year after it’s paid.  What is the best way to do this?  For my car - sell privately or trade-in?  I know they will try to get me to trade-in for a more expensive car and I am not doing that.  Should I buy privately?  I worry about lemons.  Is this a pipe dream?
Any advice/assistance is appreciated.  Thank you!why would you want to dispose the vehicle on which you know the history and where the mileage is barely into the teenage years?
you can easily get 200+ thousand miles out of it with proper care and maintenance…
getting a cheap used car is a good recipe to get into the never-ending repair bills business, so financially you will be no better than now, most likely worse
if you must sell it, private party sale will give you more cash, but at expense of hassle talking to many strange people and some scam risks attached. these can be controlled, but ask youself if you want it
buying from the private party as a sure recipe for disaster unless you are very mechanically savvy and/or pay $100+ inspection to your own trusted mechanic
all to all… why?You seem to be budget conscious based on not wanting to get a more expensive car. Yet you don’t explain why you want to get rid of your 6 year old Honda with very low mileage. Is there something wrong with it?
I don’t think you’re going to get anything better than what you already have for 9 grand. The only reason I’d trade one used car for another is if the old one was becoming unreliable and the new one still had a factory warranty on it. I doubt such a young Honda is that unreliable at this point, and you’re not going to find a new enough used car to still have a warranty for less than 5 figures.
So, before we can help you, explain why you want to dump your current car.KBB does not buy vehicles and they are usually very optimistic as to prices. If you think you can sell this for 8000.00 and buy something dependable for 9000 plus the 1000 you still owe on the Honda you are going to be disappointed
You have a lien so selling for lees than you owe is a problem . I think you best plan is to look on line for a new vehicle ( they also have lower loan rates then used ) that you can afford and trade in this one.
The wise move would be to just keep this one and add as much to the payments as you can and trade or sell when the vehicle is free and clear.
I just noticed the part about paying off a 9000.00 loan in a year ( that is 750.00 a month ) .  A new vehicle payment or lease would be a lot less than that.If you can pay off $9000-10000 in a year, why not payoff the Honda?



 Mija:

With all the wear, repair and tear


Have you been abusing and not maintaining your car?You are all incredibly helpful - thank you!  This is where the Knucklehead part comes in - I am sick of having a sedan and wanted a truck or something else.  Everything you all have said is quite logical for the main goals and I greatly appreciate your insight!I can understand wanting to have a truck instead of a car, if you have a true need for a truck. But that’s your call.
Overall, I’d say your best option would be to trade in the car for a new truck. But you need to let go of this dream of them paying you anywhere close to $9000 for your Honda. In all likelihood, they’ll give you less than you owe, and roll the Honda’s loan balance into your new loan payment. Obviously, this is a financial disadvantage for you,  but it’s also your call. You’re not going to be able to do this kind of trade cheaply.
Good luck.Unless you need a truck, I’d definitely wait. Truck prices are through the roof right now. Even old beat up used trucks are going for stupid money. And meanwhile, sedans are so unpopular that many companies are dropping most (and in Ford’s case, all) of them from the lineup. You’re gonna come out on the underside of the deal if you trade a sedan for a truck.Cheapest 2014 accord in my area is $12,250 w/81k miles. And it’s a sport. A grand less with 100k miles or even more. $8k is giving it away.Edmunds says your car is worth $9800 if everything works, there are no blemishes inside or outside, and it doesn’t need  they call that clean condition. That’s the trade-in value. A private party sale is $11,900. Unless there are issues that need attention, you should expect to pay off your loan and have a little something for your SUV. BTW, that buy it now price is a low ball trade-in value.
Buying a used vehicle, especially a truck or SUV, is going to cost a lot. Used vehicle prices are through the roof. Since you will get a loan, be aware that interest rates are higher on used vehicles than new ones, meaning your money won’t go as far. You are probably looking at a loan. Maybe you should consider a new vehicle, use the $9000+ as a down payment, and get something like a Honda CRV EX. My daughter did about a month ago and got a great price on the 2WD version (2020 model year). The loan would be a bit less than $20,000. If you have the income to make the payments, this is where you could get the most bang four your buck.

Other than the Mustang


It’s not a sedan. I guess you could call it a coupe if we want to limit the categories, but the traditional category is pony car. None of that means a thing for the Mustang Mach-E.I also say that this is not the time to be looking at a used truck or even a new one.  Just go online and the prices are ridiculous .OP has a 9k loan now. He has nothing to put down on a new truck. Sell accord and payoff loan. And have no extra cash.
A 2014 truck w/70k miles is $20k.
He is comparing apples/oranges.The OP currently owns a known quantity, in terms of its mechanical condition and upkeep.   A cheap used car can be–and frequently is–a classic Pig In a Poke that could easily turn into a repair nightmare.   Why would someone choose to go from a known quantity to something that has an unknown history?I agree with the other posts to keep on driving the Accord, at least until you have paid off the loan.
When I was growing up in the late 1940s through the 1950s, the auto manufacturers made each new year model look different than the previous model.  Every three years or so the cars were radically restyled.  Then Volkswagen came along with its Beetle.  The styling didn’t change and that became VW’s selling point.
Today, it’s hard for me to tell the year to year differences in a particular make.  I think.the auto manufacturers have encouraged the buying public to move from sedans and coupes to minivans, then to SUVs, and now to pickup.trucks.  I am not style conscious.  I bought a new Oldsmobile Cutlass Salon in 1978.  People told me the car was ugly.  I drove that car 33 years.  It got me where I needed to go.  I don’t care two hoots what a vehicle looks like.  I didn’t earn a living to make the auto.industry happy.

Agreed, my point was more that if you want anything new from Ford that isn’t a CUV, SUV, or Truck your only choice will be the MustangI just had a blackstone oil analysis done on my wife’s Accord. It has the 2.4 liter engine.
Paraphrasing a bit but it basically said it was unbelievable how little metal was in the oil. Wearing very well for 180000 miles on the car. 5000 on the oil. A little gas in the oil but very little. Might want to keep a good thing.

430,Strange jump start issue,Maintenance/Repairs,6,268,"I have a 2010 Honda CRV. I forgot to turn off a light in the car last night and today the car couldn’t start. A similar problem happened three months ago when the car was parked without usage for three  months, and I fixed it with a jump starter. However, this time I tried jump start using a jump starter and another car, but it didn’t work. Finally the car started after I connected the negative clip to the negative terminal of the battery, instead of to the stud bolt. According to the manual and many websites, connecting to the negative terminal is not safe. I am wondering why it worked this way. Thanks.That simply means there’s a poor connection at the battery.
TesterThe best electrical connection is positive donor battery to positive receiving battery  and same for negative.  But this is the most dangerous as batteries off gas hydrogen and a nearby spark  at the battery terminal can ignite the hydrogen with unfortunate results.  So best practice is to make the final negative connection away from the battery.  When there is a spark, it is far enough away from the hydrogen to be a non issue.  As @Tester said you have a poor connection from the battery to the rest of the cars electrical system.   Clean and tighten the connections (carefully please)The jump start stud proved to be a poor connection. The battery terminal is much larger, therefore a greater clamping force from the jump start clamp.Thanks all for the information! This really helps. I know little about car. Does this problem mean the positive-side connection between the booster battery and the car is poor? The connection looks fine to me and I brushed the positive terminal beforehand, but maybe that is not enough.
Regarding safety, yes I did see sparks when connecting the negative side to the battery. I hope I don’t need to do it in the future.It is possible that the stud bolt is the source of the bad connection, but probably less likely.
Big reminder:  when working on the battery connections, a specific order of work is important:

Remove the negative cable first, then remove the positive.
Clean both terminals.
Replace the POSITIVE first, and then replace the negative.
Doing this in the correct order protects YOU. When the negative battery is connected, your entire frame and engine are all negative. Touching the positive and the frame at the same time is not good! (Similar instructions go for the use of jumper cables.)

I hope I don’t need to do it in the future.

431,Electronic Dashboard repair,General Discussion,5,541,"Recently purchased a used 2008 Outback with some miles. It worked fine until suddenly it had trouble starting. Took it to local mechanic said it was the electronic dashboard and was not able to repair it. He sent it to our local dealer shop. Dealer shop has now had it for 7 weeks and still not repaired although they constantly have excuses (mechanic put in compromised part, ordered new and takes a while, etc.) Any advice how to move forward?I wish that I did have some advice.
Instead, I have a question:
Are you sure that this wasn’t a flood car?
If it was, it is possible that you could be chasing electrical/electronic problems forever.My advice is to give up on the dealer shop and tow the car to another (better) mechanic who can find you a dashboard or a company that can repair it.
There is a company that can sell you a repaired cluster or repair yours. The link is https://www.instrumentclusterstore.com/ 3. Repair takes about a week, not 7.

Any one please…Is the check engine light on?
If not I would just drive on. Otherwise, first clean the MAP sensor.
Typically fuel trims aren’t a problem until they reach 25%.
Long term + short trim is near zero, and that’s a good thing.Thank you for the reply.
No check light, and also there is no MAP sensor only MAF. Sum remains close to 0 but i feel it effecting fuel consumption due to rich condition.My bad. I meant MAF. I used to have a Matrix (tall Corolla) with MAF.
There is no rich condition if the front O2 sensor is working correctly.
The fuel trim #s just mean there’s a discrepancy between what the sensors indicate and what the fuel map expects.
Are you getting higher than expected fuel consumption?
Engine temp seems to rule out a failing thermostat.
However, with the car standing still the temp could look okay even with a sticky 'stat.
That leaves tire pressure, dragging brake or wheel alignment as possible causes.The long term fuel trim is comparing the actual fuel trim (fuel pressure x duration of the pulse) to a table of theoretical values stored on a table in the computer that was derived from the engineers at the manufacturer.  The actual fuel delivery during closed loop (engine warm) is determined by the O2 sensors, MAF, and other sensors.
Your air/fuel ratio is still ideal and the engine is not running lean or rich.  As the engine ages, this LTFT will change as the sensors and the engine ages.  It may even slowly change to near zero and then go positive or it may continue to go further negative.  When it gets to about 20% either way, you will get a check engine light.  Most likely at that time, the MAF sensor will be dirty, but it could be a marginal O2 sensor too.Coolant temp is after driving for 10KM.

435,Where is the best state to buy a used car?,General Discussion,20,20.3k,"Hot dry state, cold dry state, temperate state, etc.  I’m guessing hot is worst, salty east coast also bad.  Where are the lowest prices? Any thoughts?There are all kinds of problems with all kind of cars, sure a Michigan car could be rusty, but it does not mean a CA car with no rust and a bad engine is a better deal. Get an independent review of any car you might buy and know the problems before you buy.The state where you live.
TwotoneUnless you’re looking for a classic car, it doesn’t really matter that much any more. Even in salt country, cars don’t get the really nasty structurally-threatening rust they used to (or at least it takes a lot longer). You might be able to get a car that looks nicer in a non-salt area, but it’s really not going to be worth the hassle and shipping costs.Just for the sake of discussion. If buying used; I’m going to suggest states that get the least sun, are flat with moderate temperature swings. Within that state, the car that’s maintained well, driven the most considerately and always kept under cover (not heated) when not in use. Of course you need a good car to begin with. A well maintained Yugo, may still not be a good buy.
Florida being the flattest may give you the best used mechanics,  Washington having the least sunshine and moderate conditions may give you the least chance for “aging”.I’ve seen some very high mileage cars in Washington (state) and Oregon.  In West Texas they rust less but the very hot climate does the car in just the same. Same for Arizona. California cars accumulate too many miles.Where you buy it doesn’t matter.  Where it spent its life matters, and cars are moved around the country all the time.
The used car for sale at your local dealer may have come from thousands of miles away.  Ever been to one of the giant dealer-only auto auctions?Doesn’t matter much, but I put salt-using states at the bottom of my list.  Hot and dry is fine.Hot dry state.
The cold states almost all use salt, even if they’re not very wet.  (Though the wetter ones use more.)  The exceptions are, AFAIK, Alaska and Colorado.  However, you don’t want an Alaska car (seriously, if Carfax says that a car has spent more than 1 or 2 years in AK, cross that car off your list) because you have your choice of cars from coastal areas where salt spray is even worse than road salt, or you have areas where the roads suck (there goes your suspension) and it gets extremely cold in winter, meaning rapid temperature changes when starting are going to destroy your seals (or if you’re not careful, crack your head or block).
I don’t know how good or bad Colorado cars are…probably pretty good, though.
The sun in hot dry states tends to destroy paint, especially clear coat, especially on dark-colored cars.  Reds fade really badly even if the clear coat isn’t destroyed.  Rubber can dry out really badly, too.  Dashboards crack on some models (early 90s Nissans, notably) really badly, too.  Other than that, the conditions are ideal.  You could strip all the paint off of a car in Arizona…all of it…and it would be years, maybe decades, before the rust became a structural issue.  Hot climates are not a serious mechanical issue for most cars…they’re bad for the battery, but that’s about it.
Prices vary by type of car as much as by region.  Also by season.  A convertible is expensive in summer in a cold state, but expensive in winter in a hot one.  A Subaru is cheaper in Arizona (where there’s little use for its abilities) than in upstate New York.  Japanese economy cars retain a lot of value everywhere, but in Alaska it’s ridiculous (because they handle winter so well, mechanically…well, since the CV boots stopped sucking anyway).
Condition matters, too.  In a salt state, a rusty car will be really cheap.  A rust-free car will command a large premium.
The only reason to go outside your own town is if the local car market is really bad, though, and the only reason to go outside your state is if you’re looking for a specific car you can’t easily get there.You want to buy a used car (or even a new one) in a totally sober state.
Sober enough not to just fall in love, but have it checked out by YOUR mechanic.  Generally that means buying it in the state where you live.Maybe not the best state to buy from, but the state to NOT buy from is Louisiana. Too many Katrina and other flood cars have come from there and are even issued a clean title using various states that have no “salvage” title, finally winding up on the dealer’s lot with none suspecting a thing.Arizona. The land is flat, the climate dry, and everyone there is retired, so the cars get easy use and low mileage.
Seriously, the best state to buy a used car in is your home state, because you know what to expect for aging problems, you can test drive it, and you can have it checked by your trusted mechanic.Like Utah?Arizona is actually pretty mountainous.  Its two largest cities are in relatively flat valleys, but most of the state is up-down-up-down, and some of it twists around, too.
But AZ does have a pretty good private-party used car market, now that Craigslist has expanded to pretty much the whole state.Excellent answers!  I live in Oregon and it’s no surprise that SUVs command higher prices here. I searched Autotrader for used Pathfinders and found lots in NY, FL and TX - few here and more $$. Someone told me sales tax is paid in the state where a car is registered, not where it’s purchased (no sales tax in OR).  Anyone know if that’s true?  I like the “no drunks” in Utah idea.  Also retiree communities.Central Coast California from Lompoc to Paso Robles. Central California from Sacramento area to Bakersfield. Southern Ca. from Thousand Oaks to Oxnard and vicinity.
Oregon, Utah, New Mexico, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota and about ten others.
Someone told me sales tax is paid in the state where a car is registered,

Generally, if not universally, yes.  You should be able to verify that on any given state’s motor vehicle registry website.

I like the “no drunks” in Utah idea. Also retiree communities.

Reread the replies indicating how important maintenance and a good mechanic inspection is.
If you drive to Utah from Oregon to get a car or buy one in a retirement community with the belief those factors will make the car a better choice, you’ll only be fooling yourself.Agree; the states around the Great Lakes and New England have rust rates 26 times those in the South West. The length of car lives reflect that.
I once did  a study of engine rebuilding firms, and in the East there were very few compared to the car population, since the engines nearly always outlasted the bodies.
In the West there were quite a few, since the lack of rust made the engine the item needing rebuilding, along with the transmission.
Since engines last a lot longer anywhere now, you will find far fewer rebuilding shops. The old Sears catalogue has a huge automotive section with  a long list of rebuilt engines available by mail order.Also, the Utah bit was a joke. Joseph was just saying you should be in a sober state (of mind).I suggest that you plan to get a Carfax report.  That will tell you what state the car has lived in, which is more important than what state you are buying in. I’m in the East, and I am surprised how far cars have travelled after auction.",,,,

A “train” of trucks could allow communication from front to rear, so that multi-truck pile-ups could be avoided.
In the meantime, I will stir the pot. I live near I-81, where thousands of trucks travel daily.  I believe that trucks should be restricted to the right lane (socially-distanced). The trucking industry would self-police out those trucks that can’t get above 50 mph. This would stop those trucks going 80 mph and dodging in and out of traffic, and slowing to 50 on hills.

ThanksCheck your warranty book to see how long the alignment is warranted for.  If it is still warranted, then they owe you an alignment and tires.  If they don’t agree, then look up the customer service number in your owners manual or warranty book and give them a call.

You don’t .  Your tires have a separate warranty from the manufacture warranty .  And if you had read the manuals that came with the vehicle you would know that.
Find the closest dealer of the brand of tires  you have and see what they say about prorating .  And if you need an alignment that cost is also on you.

Possibly. Wheel alignment/adjustments are covered for 12 months/12,000 miles, your vehicle is 3 years old.



 VOLVO-V70:

And that could be the Toyota dealer but there is no wear warranty on OEM tires.Thanks
Vehicle was put in service December 26, 2018
Not quite 2 years yet!Here in New England I can cause ANY vehicle to go out of alignment in one afternoon.have you had an alignment done since new?  have you had the tires rotated since new?
unfortunately, 18k miles is pretty much in the wear zone for tires on a new vehicle.  Perhaps a little early, but not unheard of.  Car manufacturers tend to use cheaper tires when new in an effort to keep their costs down.Some thoughts:
OE tires only have a “Materials and Workmanship” warranty.  Any sort of treadwear is not covered (with a couple of exceptions that don’t apply here!).
Will the alignment be covered by the warranty?  Probably not.  Not only should there have been several tire rotations (if that hasn’t taken place), but there is a lot of things that could knock the alignment out.
It is my experience that the published alignment tolerances ( the range, not the target value) are too wide.  They need to be in the inner half to assure good tire wear.  Also any camber over 1° is too much for good tire wear.
Further, the OE tires probably aren’t going to wear well anyway.  Their specs are geared towards fuel economy, not good wear!  Better to get an aftermarket tire.
Your best bet is to find an alignment shop that will dial out the camber if it is excessive and set the toe to the target value - then buy a good wearing tire (one with a high UTQG treadwear rating)One pothole, one curb strike, or whatever can knock the alignment out a bit as can some normal settling of the suspension over time. There is no fighting this.Thank You all - good stuff!!!I have done struts on 3-4 equinoxes and found out my latest one has camber bolts installed. Seems to track fine. They are an interesting design.

Why are car manufacturers using these? WHY?  They must drive at night as well and see what they’re like.I am not sure about laser lights, but an ambulance moving in traffic had such bright brake lights at a light I could not see the car between us. No accident or anything, but much brighter than your average brake light.


 KathyRoberts:

You’re probably the only one. Mostly because cars don’t use lasers for headlights yet.



 KathyRoberts:

Why are car manufacturers using these? WHY?


I’m assuming you’re referring to LED or HID headlights. Manufacturers use them because. 1. They work very well, 2. They are reliable, 3. People want them.



 KathyRoberts:

They must drive at night as well and see what they’re like.


My Mustang has HID’s,  they work very well despite their relatively small size.  Low beam illumination is great, but there’s a  very sharp cutoff.  High beams throw more light down the road.  It’s a common misconception that these are brighter lights. They are not, the amount of lumens between LED/HID or old fashioned halogen lights is about the same by law.  The color temperature is the most striking difference.


 KathyRoberts:

I despise the laser headlights. I can’t possibly be alone in this


Sorry Kathy, there is no such thing as laser headlights.They are low power headlamps that provide good illumination. You aren’t looking at laser light. Lasers illuminate a phosphorus compound that emits light. That light is reflected off the housing and that’s what you see. I’m sensitive to bright lights too. When confronted with bright headlights, I look to the right of my lane , steering on the lane line. This also allows me to look at the lane ahead to avoid slower traffic there. The approaching car passes quickly and I’m back to normal driving. Mostly I think the lights are high beams that the approaching driving didn’t dim as I approached.
Edit: actually there are laser headlights. BMW uses them.  They aren’t available yet, but will be soon.



HowStuffWorks – 7 Nov 11 5



How Laser-powered Headlights Work 5
Lasers have an illumination power that's about 1,000 times more powerful than LEDs. So, will laser-powered headlamps be too intense for other motorists? Are they a traffic incident waiting to happen?





Kathy also did not like the dash lights on her last vehicle purchase . I suspect she has a vision problem or she just may be one of those people who have trouble adapting .At one time, all cars used headlights chosen from a small list of choices. Now we have a wide set of choices, but what seems to forgotten is that the choice not only affects the driver, but also the oncoming driver.  It doesn’t really make sense to choose headlights that blind the oncoming driver.
As a physicist, I understand the statement that “they are no brighter” when  outputs are measured.  However, that does not mean that they can’t appear brighter.  Your eye is not calibrated in lumens.
I find that 99 out of 100 cars are fine with me, but the driver with the ultra-blue light are blinding. My optometrist confirms that my complaint is typical, and agrees that these should be outlawed. Is it really a good idea to drive down a narrow, dark country road blinding the oncoming driver?  If your sight is so poor that these are needed, maybe it is time to quit driving.You may be right… on both.  Perhaps I’m just grumpy.   FWIW, I know they aren’t lasers that’s just how they appear to me.Thank you for that explanation!I despise the super bright headlights I see coming at me. They seem to be worst on Ford pickups and Ford and GM suvs.  Not all roads have edge lines and how safe is it to blind the driver coming at you on a two lane road.  And yes I am old and thus my eyes are not as adaptive as they used to be. Add to that all the cars and trucks with miss aimed auxiliary lights it is a genuine problem. I had a lifted pickup pull u[ behind me on a dark two lane road and filled the inside of my Camry with so much light that I had to stop because I could see nothing outside.  He was not happy with me and was laying on his horn until he finally pulled around me.He did not stop or he would have found out I was not happy with him either.You did not mention “pulling over”. I suspect most people would not be happy with you stopping in the travel lane unexpectedly.


 oldnotdeadyet:

the driver with the ultra-blue light are blinding.


It sounds like you’re referring to HIDs, which are kinda on their way out anyway because LEDs are better.
A properly setup HID system shouldn’t be much of a bother to you because they’ll have a hard cutoff line at a level above which the light would hit oncoming drivers’ eyes directly.  But there are lots of HID conversion kits out there that let you put an HID bulb into your regular halogen housing. That housing does not have the eyesight cutoff and the result is that everyone gets blinded.  Those are illegal but I’ve never heard of a cop pulling someone over for them.I live in a hilly area, and the entrance to my development is right at the peak of a hill.  This means that even the systems with a hard cutoff will be aimed at me when they approach.  The hard cutoff also means that it switches from OK to bad  very quickly.
I am not a big fan of mandatory car inspections in this modern era of car reliability, but if we have them, they should find an illegal headlight system, or an improperly aimed system.I also notice a number of folks who drive with their high beams on all the time, adding to the problem.
One thing you might want to check @KathyRoberts - your eyes.  Cataracts and other eye problems can make bright headlights even worse.I came here to post pretty much the exact same thing. These headlights are great when aimed properly on perfectly level ground. Add in any bumps on the road, or elevation changes, and other drivers get strobed.  It’s a major complaint of mine.[quote=""texases,
One thing you might want to check @KathyRoberts - your eyes. Cataracts and other eye problems can make bright headlights even worse.
Agree 100% been there done that. No more problem’s after eye surgery to remove cataracts.Some of those blue lights are not LED, Laser, or HID, they are just halogen headlights with a blue tint.  Sylvania SilverStar is one of them, they claim 2x brightness and they do draw more power and put out more light, well above the legal limit.  They don’t have the sharp cutoff either.  If you look at the very fine print on the back of the package, it says “off road only”.
Edit:  They have a very short life span too, about 100 hours compared t a typical and legal halogen of about 1000 hours.Just FYI, SilverStar Ultra have blue tint, SilverStar do not.Silverstars aren’t blue. They’re just not yellow. Unless the dweebus installing them puts a blue gel over them, which some inexplicably do. And the Silverstars are road-legal.

There isnt any weird noises but you feel the car kind of kick into second gear.  After taking it to about 3 other transmission shops everyone says it feels fine and there are no codes.  Only solution is to remove the trans to see whats internally wrong but at the cost of basically rebuilding it again $1300-1400.

I have a '96 with the 4rw70 (or some such designation) tranny and had a transgo shift-improver kit installed by a local xmission shop. I bought the version that was supposed to provide more positive shifts (as for taxis and such), but not harsh, racing shifts. I think the guy at the shop took a shortcut and only installed the hardware that came with the kit, but didn’t do any of the drilling that was also required. When starting to drive for the first time on any given day, the first shift from 1st to 2nd slams, as in a racing shift. It’s usually only the first shift of the day that hits that hard. After that, it’s firm, but no uncomfortably so. The rest of the gears shift ok all of the time. Though my case is a little different than yours, I thought you might find it useful.
JohnThat sounds exactly like my issue just the other way around.   Typically my first ride in the am to work is fine i notice it on my way home and than to school almost every time i stop and go.   Its not violent just really annoying.   Before the rebuild it shifted fine except the whining and slipping into 3-4 gear.Old post I know but I’m having the same issue. Any idea what it was?

I have access to a well stocked garage and was going to rent a jack for the project. I’m too broke to let the dealership do it. Thanks in advance.We have no idea of your technical abilities or skills.
Take the car to a local, independent transmission shop for a second opinion. You may be surprised at what they find, and also they price the quote you (much lower).
Dealerships tend to want to replace everything at the most expensive cost. Not always, but most of the time. Unless you’ve totally neglected this transmission, I’d be surprised that a 2012 Honda transmission needed replacing, as opposed to repairing.
Good luck.It’s a big project. Have you looked at YouTube for this to see if you can do it?How many miles on civic?
Have you ever had the fluid changed?Have an independent trasmission shop, not Aamco, and let them look at it. I the trans needs to be replaced, have them put in one of those $500 used ones.
Given that a new replacement is $5000 and used goes for $500 tells me that these don’t fail very often so it may be a fairly simple repair.Is the Check Engine light on?
Or is the D4 light blinking?

Tester89,000. I had the transmission fluid changed the problem was happening before that but might have been exacerbated by the change.Yep check engine light was on D4 was blinkingGet the code(s) pulled.
Might not need a transmission. Just a shift control solenoid.

TesterI took it to an independent mechanic their diagnostics weren’t sophisticated enough to pinpoint the problem. The mechanic suspected the transmission was going out though. I took it to the dealership on their advice and the dealership confirmed a replacement was needed. The independent mechanic was a little bit cheaper but not by much and backed up on availability for transmission replacements. As for my technical abilities I removed all of the solenoids and tested them with a multimeter and connected them to the battery to make sure they worked. They were all functional. But that’s the extent of what I’ve done on a car.Personally I would never attempt to replace a transmission myself.
Reasons being I have no experience working with one of the more complex pieces of automotive hardware out there. I also don’t have access to a lift, either for the vehicle or the transmission. Let alone any specialized tools or computer hardware to configure the transmission.
Plus I have a wife who would not approve of a garage or driveway full of old parts and fluids everywhere. Which might be the strongest reason of all.
There are other transmission shops out there; keep on looking. Good luck.I appreciate the advice. My aspirations get ahead of my practicality sometimes so I need third party input. Thanks.",,,,

445,New Puzzler (homemade),The Show,17,313,"The days of the on-air puzzler are long gone, more’s the pity. No more listening to Ray try to get through a sentence while Tom helpfully interrupts. I was nostalgically going through some of the old puzzlers on the site and one of them reminded me of an experience I had. This is 100% true, no obfuscation needed.
Back in the summer of 2017 I was in California with my 21-year-old daughter. We’d flown out to visit my mom after my dad died. The plan was to drive back to Kansas City with some of the bulkier aspects of my inheritance–paintings, statuary, engine blocks… that sort of thing. So we rented a Kia Sedona (Tom: Is that important? Ray: No. It could’ve been any vehicle big enough to carry their crap. Tom: So it had to be a big vehicle? Ray: Only to carry the stuff. For puzzler purposes it could’ve been a Mini Cooper. Tom: Ah, ok. Ray: Can I continue now?).
We rented a Kia Sedona and loaded all the stuff in. We bought supplies for the trip–bottled water, beef jerky, couple of bags of potato chips, chewing gum, the extra big bottle of Filippo Berio Olive Oil… the usual–and we set off.
We took I-70 through the Colorado Rockies and it was just gorgeous. We were driving past Vail, about 2 miles above sea level, and marvelling at the beauty around us. Grassy slopes, crystal clear streams, rugged rock faces, two or three deer running up one of the hills. Beautiful. Then all of a sudden… boom! It was a muffled sound, not too loud from inside the car, but you can bet it startled us.
“What the heck was that?!” I asked.
My daughter shrugged.
A few seconds later… boom! Same sound. We were worried now. What was going on? The van was running perfectly. The engine sounded fine. The steering was fine, the ride was smooth, and we definitely weren’t feeling the tha-bump tha-bump tha-bump of a flat tire. No warning lights were going off. Still, I was looking for the next exit and thinking about pulling off to the side just to give the van a walkaround and maybe stare at the engine like I knew what to look for.
Before I did that, I had a brilliant thought. I told my daughter to check something for me. She did, confirmed I had correctly diagnosed the problem, and we kept driving without worries.
What did I tell my daughter to check?

Potato chip bags.
Boom! (But, dude, you’re supposed to spoiler tag the answer so other people can take a shot.) As we’d been increasing our elevation, the air in the bags had been expanding until, finally, it had nowhere to go but out. The bags were both wide open.See if the bowling ball is secured?

An all-expense paid trip to the den for a celebratory glass of whiskey!Agree BOGUS I have been over that route many time’s with the same thing’s the OP had except for the gum and olive oil and never had a bag of chip’s blow up.


 Barkydog:

For the ones going over a mountain pass that would cause the bag to explode, you would ship them in a refrigerated truck/trailer, keep it cold enough that the air in the bag contracts enough make up the difference.
Kind of like when you buy a helium filled balloon in the winter,
The balloon is full and floats while in the store, you take it outside into the cold, the balloon shrinks and no longer floats until warmed back up to room temperature.


 Renegade:

Agree BOGUS I have been over that route many time’s with the same thing’s the OP had except for the gum and olive oil and never had a bag of chip’s blow up.


I can see it happening if conditions are just right. If the bag was packed on a high atmospheric pressure day at low altitude, then OP drove up into the mountains on a low atmospheric pressure day, it’s reasonable. Especially if the chip bags are packed in amongst a bunch of other stuff that presses on the bag as it expands, which would increase internal pressure even more. Picture a badly inflated chip bag that then gets poked by the corner of a cracker box.You can say BOGUS all you want. It happened. Just as told. Except for the Filippo Berio Olive Oil. They were Lay’s Limón potato chips which at the time we could get in California but not out here. I understand the objection that it hasn’t happened to you. That’s quite believable and could be down to any number of things–different brand, different barometric pressure, you’d already eaten the chips. This happened to us pretty near the marker saying we’d reached the highest point. So if any bag survives that–and I’m sure many do–it’s downhill from there.Some of that’s possible. I don’t recall the bags being tightly packed. And they definitely didn’t have small holes. The entire top of both bags was wide open. So pressure had been applied equally across the entire seam until the whole thing gave at once.You can say BOGUS all you want
Not saying it did not happen to you but as shadowfax said it could happen.                  I read your post to mean it would happen to all potato chip bag’s and other’s like it.No, not at all! I wouldn’t generalize from two data points. My experience might be highly unusual.
I did find myself wondering how potato chip shippers deal with this problem if it’s not uncommon. I figured Frito-Lay just wouldn’t ship to Vail from their Bakersfield factory at 404’ above sea level. (I’m guessing that was the origin of the bags we purchased in Escondido at 646’ above.) A quick check suggests the natural Frito-Lay supplier for Vail would be the Gothenburg, Nebraska factory which is at 2,569′.Maybe the potato chips had an unusually volatile flavor ingredient.  Scent is the largest contributor to flavor; it isn’t a scent unless it’s volatile.  Sometimes manufacturers screw up and put too much in.Thanks for the puzzler. Reminds me of the days of yore.",,,,

That’s probably why he hasn’t. I know my mechanic waives his diagnostic fee if you elect to have him do the work (although his diagnostic fee isn’t $100, he charges by time worked)Considering he spent about 5 minutes from hooking up the reader to diagnosis his labor rate would have to be $1,000/hr. to even remotely justify a charge of $100. I’d gladly pay a reasonable amount though.Most places have a set fee for Diagnostic work and 100.00 is low for many parts of the US .Local Honda dealer had a $120 diagnostic fee (about 10yrs ago) to verify an issue with Dad’s 2007 CRV. Long time mechanic diagnosed the problem and fixed it for about $90. Any diagnostic work at the independent shop is paid by the hour. But we’ve been going to them since 1993.That’s pretty much what Mike does. He charges for work performed.

My mechanic’s shop is on his private property, so he has some built in saved overhead costs since he doesn’t have to pay rent…I haven’t been out there in awhile, but I think his hourly is between $80-100. Additionally, he knows I do most of the work on my cars, so when he’s doing inspection, he let’s me know what needs to be done and gives me the option to let him do it or to take it back home and do it myself.

447,3.8 02 Impala. Possible fuel pump problems?,Maintenance/Repairs,5,167,"So it seems just today I started hearing a loud hissing/whining towards the rear of my car (thought it was a punctured tire at first). I’m pretty sure it’s something with the fuel pump as I can also hear it when the key is in the “on” position and the engine is still off. Anyways can anyone maybe have a clue on what this could be? I’m hoping it’s just a bad fuel filter as I’m not sure when it was last replaced and it might be making the pump work harder? I’m not entirely sure but any help would be greatly appreciated!
P.s. Not sure if this helps but car still seems to running fine on the road for now leading me to believe it’s still getting enough fuel.See an  independant mechanic since we cannot test the car over the internet. You wil probably get tons of guesses on this but take my advice, see a mechanic.Have someone listen at the fuel filler neck with the cap off when you turn the key on. Offhand it does sound like a fuel pump.
For what it’s worth, a pump can be noisy and still provide enough fuel to allow the engine to run fine. For now. At some point it will die in the most inopportune spot. And you are correct, a partially clogged fuel filter can make a pump work harder and do it in sooner than normal. It’s 19 years old so it’s due.
Matter of fact, fuel pump on my GMC Sonoma is on this week’s agenda. Went to town on Friday with no issues and a no-start at the last stop on the way out  of town. I assumed the pump died and sure enough that is the now known problem I have to tackle. The AAA policy just paid for itself and then some…Does the noise last longer than a couple of seconds when the ignition is turned to on without stating the engine?
If so, it’s not the fuel pump.

I have no idea what that is or where to look for one.I suspect this is not a U.S. user. I’ve seen the “black top” phrase used for previous Corolla generations - the 2001 U.S. model is not a black top.
Regardless, I cannot imagine it’s worth repairing either.There are a great many important details missing that are necessary for determining the cause of the catastrophic failure. It’s possible that tearing down the engine can determine the cause but not a certainty. I once replaced an engine that threw a rod because the automatic transmission had locked up in 1st gear and the driver was determined to merge into 65 mph traffic. The driver was totally deaf.And given that it’s far out of warranty, unless you lent your car to someone and intend to sue them for breaking it, determining the cause is kind of irrelevant. New engine or have it towed to the scrap yard.

+1, assuming that such things exist in the OP’s unknown country…I looked on line. It’s a JDM engine. There’s one available with a 5 speed manual for $1900. Also, there’s an engine block for $600. You might get them for a bit less.Good grief
Unless the car’s in showroom condition, it doesn’t rate a $1900 jdm engine
Going with just block is a very big risk, in my opinion.  Who’s to say the existing cylinder head’s in good shape?A connecting rod only goes through the block for these reasons.
Excess wear and/or very high miles.
Lack of oil or oil pressure due to wear or oil sludging.
Excessive RPMs; exacerbated and with a lower RPM level due to wear.
Metallurgical failure. The odds of this are so low I hate to even suggest it.
Some more info might help. Total miles on the car, bought new or used, and the often unknown question of if this is a used car has it been run out of oil in the past or run chronically low on oil all the time?
Twenty years old and with a scrap metal engine means its junk yard time IMO.

I’ve already changed the blend door actuator. Replaced it incorrectly the first time so got a bit familiar with it. Had cold air blasted on me and had to mess with the alignment of it. Luckily no damage, installed it again appropriately and the heater was working again on the driver side. But even with a new actuator, the passenger side still only gets cold air.

The trouble with that tactic is that high school kids all think they’re invincible and will never die. And then they egg each other on into laughing at the gore rather than thinking about how driving a car can cause it for real. I didn’t see that tactic as all that effective.Since I started driving when I was 12  I found drivers ed pretty boring when I was 16 and took it in school.
I hit 6’ when I was 12 and drove very carefully because I was not old enough for a license so I never got pulled over.  K lives in a rural community with no local police so neither the State Police or County Sheriffs knew me by sight.
Once I turned 16 all bets were off, my learners permit got suspended.If this isn’t the one it’s at least along the same lines. I went through a private driving school that didn’t show such a film. The majority of the time was spent in one on one driving lessons.
INFAMOUS DRIVER'S EDUCATION SCARE FILM HIGHWAY OF AGONY 61704
I remember having to take driver education back in 1957 so that the family insurance rates would be lowered.  My dad had taught me how to drive. Our car, a 1954 Buick had a three speed manual column shift transmission.  My dad had me shift into high gear as soon as the engine wouldn’t labor.  This meant on flat ground that it was o.k. to skip 2nd gear.  The driver education instructor said that was wrong–2nd gear shouldn’t be skipped.  Also, on a flat street, the Buick had enough torque that I often started in 2nd gear.  The driver training car was a 1957 Chevrolet 6 with a manual transmission.  The engine didn’t have enough torque to start in 2nd without slipping the clutch.  Another truck I learned that wasn’t taught in driver training was to double clutch to downshift into first gear.  First gear was not synchronized back then, so if one needed to shift into first climbing a steep grade, this was the only way to do it.

That’s still happening today. Drivers-Ed lowers liability rates by up to 25%.
When I got my license at 16 in NYS - with Drivers-ed I could drive at night. Without drivers end I could only drive at night if it was driving to or from a school event.
My 3 kids went to private high -schools so I had to pay for the drivers-ed. Well worth it.
Mr. Holland's Opus - Keep On Running
When I was in high school, we had ONE driver ed car for a student enrollment of of about 3,000.   Even if you count only the students who were age-eligible for a Learner’s Permit, the availability of just one car meant that only a very small handful of students actually got Behind-The-Wheel driver training, and I was one of the ones who never even sat in that car.  And yet, the high school certified to both the state DMV and my father’s insurance company that I had taken–and passed–Behind-The-Wheel Driver Ed.
We did have the usual classroom-based theory sessions, including the gory crash films, but my father used to take me out on Sunday mornings–when the roads were essentially empty–for my only Behind-The-Wheel training.   I guess that he was a good instructor because, with the exception of a couple of minor bone-headed fender benders when I was in my teens,  I have driven since 1970 without any accidents.
Fast forward to sometime in the '80s.  As a high school counselor, I was enrolling a transfer student who asked me if I could make sure that she got “Under The Wheel” training.  
Without skipping a beat, I told her that we had discontinued that type of training after a few students were crushed to death, but that I would make sure that she got something better.    Of course, I enrolled her in Behind-The-Wheel Driver Ed.I took drivers ed in high school in 1966.  Our cars were supplied by a local Oldsmobile dealership.
So we had brand new Olds;  Cutlass, Delta 88, and a Toronado.  We had them for X number of days or miles then they were turned back in.  The dealership then sold them as ‘program’ cars at a discount, and probably a tax deduction.  I don’t know if the school board paid anything for the use, we were charged for the course.  As I remember a very low fee.

At my high school, we had one plain-vanilla '62 Chevy sedan, and even though I never got to sit in it for driver training, the following year when my father was car-shopping, we took it for a test drive when the dealership was selling it as a used car.
We were used to Plymouths, and my father’s immediate reaction while driving it was to ask the salesman “Why is this car constantly floating up and down?”    Before the salesman could respond, I said, “Oh, that’s Chevrolet’s Jet Smooth Ride, Dad”.  
The salesman glared at me, my father decided that he couldn’t tolerate the marshmallow suspension and lousy handing of the Chevy, and we wound up with a new '63 Plymouth.

I get a significant discount from GEICO for taking a driving safety course every 3 years.  It may be for old people only.@RandomTroll This driving safety course for an insurance discount for old people won’t help me, as I am only 79.It’s for folks 55+ with Pemco as long as you take an approved defensive driving course.I taught 3 boys to drive in a Korean War surplus Jeep driving along power line right of ways and getting into a real car for drivers ed was a ‘piece of cake’ for them so to speak. My daughter was a late in life surprise and the Jeep was gone and in drivers ed the instructor never let her drive after her first short effort because she was too nervous.  My best success with her came from turning her loose behind my shop driving alone on a 1/4 mile private drive in a 5 speed S-10. It cost me a clutch but after 2 weeks I let her drive me home in that truck and drivers ed noted how proficient she had become took her off the roster of those needing on the road training.We never had those gruesome “worst case scenario” videos in my driver’s ed class in high school
As for the car . . . yeah, there was only one for a high school with roughly 800 students, grades 9-12 . . . it was a 1st generation VW Golf.  Over in the USA, they were sold as “Rabbit”
Anyways, it was a gasoline-powered model.  4 door, power nothing.  Come to think of it, I’m pretty sure it had an automatic, which ensured acceleration was “less than impressive” to be polite
I know those were small cars and didn’t have strong engines, but they were adequate for somebody just going to/from work
It wasn’t really okay when there were 1 driving instructor and 3 teenage guys all jammed in there.  At that point, it became woefully underpowered
The school had a contract with a local driving school, and it must have been a one-man operation, because there was only 1 car and 1 instructor.
I seem to remember that you had to take driver’s ed to graduate high school, but don’t quote me on that.  In any case, each student had several hours of classroom instruction . . . led by one of the school’s teachers, not the driving school instructor . . . and just a few hours of behind the wheel training.  Come to think of it, it might have just been 1 outing, which only lasted a few hours.
Like many of the other regulars, my dad spent a lot of time driving with me in his spare time.  Every weekend we would spend many hours driving, in literally ALL conditions.  Day, night, sunny, overcast, rain, snow, ice, city, country lanes, etc.
After I got my learner’s permit, my dad practiced driving with me for a full year before I took the driving test.  By that time, I was ready, and I passed the driving test with flying colors



 RandomTroll:

I get a significant discount from GEICO for taking a driving safety course every 3 years. It may be for old people only.


My mom took one of those last year, and easily passed.  I wasn’t present, but she said it wasn’t a big deal.My parents knew how badly I wanted to drive so paid for instruction by the local AAA. I took the classroom sessions before my 16th birthday but was never shown any “Blood on the Highway” gore films. The Thursday I turned 16, Dad took me to get my learner’s permit. I passed, of course. I drove that weekend about 8 hours with Dad. On Monday, the driving portion of the class came each morning for 5 days the week following my birthday. 2 1/2 weeks after I turned 16 (my state’s minimum driving age) I passed my driving test and drove to school that same morning.
If I’d taken it in school, it would have taken 4 months and I would have missed the opportunity to get a job delivering prescriptions for a pharmacy.
21 years later, I tried to teach my 62 year old Mother to drive after Dad passed. THAT is a whole 'nother story!

Never try to teach your parents how to do anything. I learned that lesson 20 years ago when Mom wanted me to teach her HTML.I got my permit at 16 in and then license 9 months later when I lived in NY. At the time you couldn’t get a license unless you had a permit for 6 months.
NH is really different. We don’t have a permit system. You can start driving at 15.5 with a licensed adult over 21. Then when you think you’re ready you take the written test. Most states give this test to get a permit. When you pass the written test then you can take the driving test. Kinda backwards


 MikeInNH:

Kinda backwards


Yes, that is a bit backwards. I think Ohio wanted the new driver to know the laws, even if their parents did not, before they drove. Made sense to me.Notice I wrote the word “tried”  :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye
She did get her license but friends rode with her… maybe with Zanax and a shot…The other stupid thing about NH…because we don’t have a permit system my kids could only drive in NH. We’re a border town. Our house is less then a mile from MA. All 3 kids went to private high-schools in MA.",,,,

AMC’s original prototype, the Tarpon, was built on the shorter Rambler American chassis and it had much better proportions, IMHO.    Why the top brass chose to alter the design from decent to (fill in the blank…) was a mystery, to even AMC’s  design staff.

For some reason I love the look of those strange cars like the Gremlin, Hornet, Pacer, Javelin.


I occasionally see an AMC Pacer around here in use as a daily driver.  It’s in immaculate condition but doesn’t appear restored.  I’ve never driven or ridden in one but Pacers appear to have had great driver visibility all around, far better than most cars.I just clicked on your link
As for the Tarpon concept car . . .
How shall we say it . . . ?
I’m not loving it I don’t know if it was the same designer that designed the AMC cars and the pontiac aztek but they both put the UG in ugly.There is a poor ground connection for the instrument cluster. The ground connection for the instrument cluster is located behind the left kick panel (the trim panel next to your left foot).Great visibility but I heard the Pacers got hot in the sunAround here the AMC Pacer was called an upside down fish bowl with wheel’s.I actually like the Marlin. A car dealer here who deals in a few old cars had one on his lot about 6 or 7 years ago. Kind of a Royal Blue with Cragar wheels. Very slick looking car.
An old girl friend of mine back in the day had a Gremlin X with a 304 in it. I drove it a few times and while the car was pretty fast I could never get past the rear half looks. Car, not her…
Some of those Gremlins are bringing some fairly big bucks now; especially the X models with the V-8s.A friend had a Gremlin back in the '60s.
More seriously, I have an '87 Toyota pickup.  It had a short somewhere in the wires that served the dashboard.   I ended up cutting each one to find the culprit.  It turned out to be the last one in the harness but it was for the glovebox light, which the pickup lacks (It’s for the Forerunner that uses the same chassis.), so didn’t have to fix it.I love it!

 A gremlin is a folkloric mischievous creature that causes malfunctions in aircraft or other machinery. Depictions of these creatures vary. Often they are described or depicted as animals with spiky backs, large strange eyes, and small clawed frames that feature sharp teeth.
 Since World War II, different fantastical creatures have been referred to as gremlins, bearing varying degrees of resemblance to the originals.

Thank you ManuelNot much you can do now, unless you have documentation of the problem from two years ago.
Two years ago you should have elevated your complaint as instructed in your owners manual.Unfortunately Purebred is correct. If this is a problem from when the car was new it’s a little late. If it’s a problem that developed after you had the car a while it would be interesting to figure out why but you still probably won’t get satisfaction.Get a lawyerNew as in 3 or 4 miles on it or maybe as a demonstrator with a few hundred miles on it? If the latter, that is a used car and at times dealer demostrators have managed to get involved in some wrecks while in use.
If the former then one has to wonder about damage during unloading from a transport truck or possibly being rammed accidentally while parked on the lot.
A transport driver at the Chevy dealer next to the import place where I worked backed a new Monte Carlo off the side of the ramps and dumped the car on the right side. It was written off as a total loss and the driver was not dinged up too badly although he may have lost his job over that incident.

Without pictures showing the “good” side and the “mismatched” side for comparison . . . we won’t be able to offer any good opinions or ideasI don’t know if this still applies but way back, when dealers could sell any Japanese car for list price plus, distributors used new vehicles as “employee cars” up to I believe 3,000 miles and then turned the cars over to dealers to sell as new cars and they were happy to have them.
And if he car got into an accident they were even happier because they could make money on the insurance repair and still sell it for full price as a new car.

Now, it doesn’t “surge” at a drive thru; but if waiting in line for awhile it will just die.  It doesn’t want to start but if you can get it started and into gear fine, it is fine and straight and normal.  In all cases, the temp gauge shows nothing other then normal midline readings.

I used to know a guy who was pampered by his parents for their entire life, and who claimed that he didn’t even know how to make a sandwich.   I said to him, You really want me to believe that, even though you earned a Master’s Degree in European languages, you are unable to figure out how to put slices of meat and/or cheese between two slices of bread?
Trust me… when the time finally came for him to fend for himself, he figured out the… complexity… of making sandwiches, and he even learned how to cook some simple dishes.

Well to be fair, nothing about Dad’s life was pampered. He was separated from his family at 12 and spent the next 3 years in a wartime interment camp with little more than the clothes on his back and his wits, so I have no doubt about his ability to fend for himself. He went on to be fluent in three languages, a business owner successful in his trade, and spent his final working years as a college lecturer teaching his trade.
But though he loved to eat, cooking was something he never, ever did. When I was a kid Mom could put together dinner on plates, leave a note that said “microwave for 5 minutes” and he would look at that and say “come on, we’re going out.” When I was a 19 year old kid I was packing up cookware and he said “Why don’t you just go to a restaurant or diner to eat or get take-out?”
He was the same way about cars. He would change a tire or a headlight and top off the oil and coolant, but anything further than that he would take the car to the garage because “those guys can do it better and faster”. And now I’m one of those guys.
Oh, I forgot. He could also make instant coffee. I told a friend how to make chicken soup and he was amazed. No, it wasn’t canned.I’m afraid this topic has become hijacked.  To clarify,  it would perform the same if going through a salad or sushi dtivethru.
Any other ideas related to the symptom?  I read one post suggesting computer reprogram.


 Steve-from-Idaho:

sushi dtivethru.


I don’t know anyone that makes their own sushi. Everyone I know gets carry out. I certainly do. I can’t decide which one to go to. There are two in the same grocery store. I haven’t been to another grocery a couple miles farther away, and I’m sure they have at least two.I would check out the fuel system pressure to see if it is weaker at idle speed. I assume it is an electric pump and the charge voltage will be lower at idle speed so the pump pressure will be less also. If the pump pressure is already weak that may explain the issue. Check the fuel filter also and replace it first to see if that helps before replacing the pump.

TIPM Electrical Problems 2
If you've heard of a TIPM, chances are you own a vehicle from Fiat-Chrysler (FCA). Think of it like a command center for all the electrical functions of your car, and in FCA's case a very, very disfunctional one.





TesterDisconnected the battery terminals for 24 hours and charged the battery during that time.  Reconnected battery terminals and cranked truck.  Security light stayed on constantly while truck was running.  After restarting the security light now blinks constantly, as before.  There is no noticeable performance issues with the truck and all gages and accessories function normally.  Does the firmware have to be reinstalled or an adjustment made every time there is an issue with the battery?  That seems  to be rather unusual for any vehicle.Check your owner’s manual. It’s possible the security indicator is supposed to flash whenever it is armed.   Another idea, there’s a computer-data-bus (CAN - bus) in your car that allows for computer-to-computer communication  between the various modules.  If that bus stops working for some reason the security indicator may turn on.  To diagnose, your shop would use a scan tool would  to probe the CAN bus functions to make sure they are all working. Even a single transistor failure could caused the CAN bus to not work correctly.    Did you jump start another car, or receive a jump start yourself just prior to this problem?  As mentioned above the TIPM is a common cause of weird problems. If all else fails ask your shop to temporarily replace it, might work.

You have a short somewhere between the fuse box and the instrument cluster. You’ll need someone who is experienced with a multimeter and armed with a schematic diagram to track this down.If you want to try and fix this yourself you should invest in a factory service manual for the wiring of the car. Ebay is a good place to get one. It will show you all the accessories the fuse ties to. Check the cigarette lighter socket to see if it is shorted. One way to help you find the short is to replace the fuse with something like a brake light bulb. It will limit the current going to the short to a safe limit on the wiring. The short will make the bulb glow brightly. You then start removing suspected loads that may be causing the trouble. When you disconnect the wiring that has the short on it the light will dim or go out completely depending if there is another current path to ground or not.",,,,

We have problems with the power steering on our Mazda 3 2011. After starting the car up it can take anywhere from a few seconds to an hour for the power steering to kick in . During that time the power steering warning light is on and it’s extremely hard to turn the steering wheel - as expected. We have owned the car for several years and most of the time it takes just a few seconds for the power steering to engage but sometimes there are weeks or months when it takes minutes or up to an hour of driving/being started up for it to engage.
We took the car to Mazda service a few times to get it diagnosed but by the time we got there the power steering was working and they didn’t find any problem. We tried replacing the battery too and didn’t observe any noticeable difference.
One more thing to note is that if that once the power steering engages it continues to work flawlessly until you park the car for a few hours . If you just park, go shopping and come back to it it engages fast. But if you let the car sit overnight, the problem is back. That is the only pattern we noticed.
We’ll be trying some smaller car shops close by in the hopes that we can get there before the power steering engages and they can diagnose it, but any ideas ?
Thank you!There may be a problem with the electric power steering pump.

It wasn’t her fault but she has bad luck with cars. My friend also has bad luck with cars.
What do I do?Call your insurance agent and let them take over.Take it through the carwash several times to get the outside smell out. I would shampoo the interior several times, take the floor mats and pour tomato juice over them; it really works.
I assume this is a real problem, not a hypothetical one.
Your car is not ruined. Your wife did not do it; the skunk did!I have heard that brewed coffee leftover absorbs smells well. Have tried it once with good luck for a minor smell issue.As long as no skunk juice got inside the car, the residual odor will slowly dissipate.  A good professional detail shop may be able to help…Get a couple of aluminum roasting pans from the grocery store. Take some towels you don’t care for and place them into the roasting pans. Place the pans on the floor of the front and rear seat.
Now take some distilled white vinegar and soak the towels. Let the soaked towels sit in the pans overnight.

I recently inspected a vehicle that creamed a deer and guts, meat and manure entered the cabin via the knocked out windshield. It was in the 90’s the week I saw it and it sat there 4 days before I got the assignment. It was horrible!!! It sat another two weeks waiting for parts.
After repairs were completed the owner called me to ask a question and he stated there was barely a hint of the odor.And don’t blame she for ruining the car. She hit a skunk. Do you think she did it on purpose?I used to drive by a whole family of skunks everyday when I lived in Colorado.  I’d often stop the car and watch them.  Skunks are really playful and clever.  These ones weren’t suicidal though, so I never myself encountered the problematic side of skunks and their relationship to cars.  They do run quite fast and corner quickly, so it would be difficult to avoid one that was determined to get run over I think.  My guess is the odor will for the most part just go away on its own, but it might take a few car washes and a few months.   You may have to put the car on a lift and wash the underside that way.    The more you drive the car, the quicker it will go away too I expect. I guess besides the remedies above, I’d be inclined to put a big tray of 1/2 inch of  baking soda in the car and let it sit, replacing it every few days.The smell will leave,leave the windows down every oppurtunity-some people have problems avoiding animals(never understood why so many possums get ran over)-KevinCome back to reality.  Your car is not ruined and your girl is not to blame.  There are many good suggestions above regarding your car.  Try them.  Then show a little sympathy for the driver.@shadowfax I recommended pouring tomato juice on the floor mats if they are rubber and doing it outside the car of course!
Other suggestions from posters make a lot of sense.Some 30+ years ago … Spencer gifts use to sell Skunk Smell air fresheners. I bought one and put it my friends car. He drove around in the middle of winter of winter for a couple of days before he realized where the smell was coming from.In addition to cleaning the interior, or having your insurance company handle it, there are portable air purifiers that can help eliminate odors. These are usually “ozone” air purifiers. A good 30 minute “scrub” with an strong ozone purifier might do wonders. You can rent them, too.My daughter is trying to get into med or vet school (don’t know yet) but both require working in a clinical setting with your application.  She worked for a vet last summer and I remember her telling me that her vet sold a product which dealt with this issue when dogs get “skunked”.  Want me to call and get the product name?  RocketmanI don’t think any of the skunk got into the interior of the car, but you should pull the front windshield fairing and clean out around the air intake, as far down as you can reach.  Then replace the cabin air filter as it will hold most of the “juice”.
You cannot clean out under the car unless you put it up on a rack.  You could try ramps or jack stands, but that puts you directly under the stuff you are trying to remove, it could drip on you.
Skunks get hit a lot.  In their natural environment, they are not afraid of much.  Not many predators will risk getting sprayed.  when they hear a predator running up on them, they hike their butt in the air and fire.  That stops almost all predators.
Unfortunately for them, a car sounds just like a predator coming at them so the respond in the same way.  They do not try to get out of the way.  Typically they are blasting the car just before it hits them.  There was a Nature special on skunks on PBS.  Quite interesting.  BTW, cats and skunks will become friends and cats will share their food with them.  Dogs not so much, thats why dogs get sprayed more often than cats.UPDATE- I have state farm full coverage and Its in their hands now.
I tried pans of vinegar, febreeze, bio-kleen, a homemade cleaner… airing out the car for 3 days, The smell is on the interior of the car the windows were open when she hit the skunk. When she walked in the house she smelled like she got sprayed by a skunk, her clothes she was wearing still smell after washing them.
The smell inside the car has dissipated a tad but its still so strong that no one has been able to go in the car for very long, My eyes water and I feel nauseous just sitting in the drivers seat trying to put the windows down. I know it sounds extreme but 4 people have agreed its horrible, even 2 people that thought I was exaggerating.
The car was deemed not drivable due to the smell  by state farm, it got towed to a toyota dealer body shop today and see what they can do. There is no body damage but state farm said to take it to a body shop and go from there.  I have a rental car but I miss the Prius.
Somehow spray got into the interior, the drivers seat back and headrest seem the worst. What can you do… The tow truck dude thought it was stupid to tow a car that had no body or mechanical damage… Until he got in it, he had to get out to get air, its that bad. He smelled like skunk once he got out, he said he never seen anything like it.
Its going to have to go on a lift to completely clean the underside and the interior is anyone’s guess.
There are two people on the internet that claim their cars were totaled due to the skunk smell, they claim its almost impossible to completely remove.
The car is a lease with 31 months to go, it had 5k miles on it. Depending on what the bodyshop says I will call the leasing company since its their car. I don’t want this to be an issue when I turn it in. I was going to keep the car but now since its tainted its going back at the end of the lease.
I don’t hold her responsible, there are so many animals that get hit around here, I have a friend that has had a total of over 17k of animal related repairs on a 2007 civic over the life of the car, 80% of the car has been repainted. He got married and was driving his new wifes focus for a total of 3 days before he tagged a deer, it was wiped out bad.
It just plain sucks, I am very sensitive to smells, I am worried this won’t end up well… Time will tell…
Thanks for all of the help!!
I will keep updating…@kmccune ""(never understood why so many possums get ran over)
It’s because they are stupid. The first car that whooshes by them causes them to go into “playing possum” mode. The second one hits the dormant future greasy spot.
The good thing is, animal strikes are considered comprehensive claims by State Farm and other insurance companies. It’s like they are acts of God because He created them dumb.
I’m surprised that fresh air and sunshine have not dissipated the skunk smell by now. I mean, when a skunk has sprayed anything near my house, the smell is totally gone in a day or three. I used to shoot skunks from my back porch when I was a kid on the farm.  Shooting them always caused a stink. They’d come into the yard at night, looking for left over cat food.  By morning they’d be gone, scavenged by birds of prey with a poor sense of smell.  I’m told owls qualify.   I’ve hit several  with cars, and even one while landing  my old Piper Cherokee one night.  I’ve never had an issue with lingering smell.
Please let us know what the insurance company does for you. Inquiring minds want to know.Thanks for the update. I’m sure the body shop guys are cursing your name. Half the crew probably called in sick to avoid working on your car.",,,,

(What is the plural of “Trax” anyway?) A 2020 should be under warranty.

I would recommend filing a safety report with NHTSA too. If they receive enough complaints about a certain model-year, it will trigger an investigation and possible recalls (if the investigation turns up anything)Even if the car itself malfunctioned, due to a design flaw or manufacturing defect, you probably got ticketed by the police, and will lose a bunch of money as a result.  I am also curious about what GM will do with regards to warranty.  If a warrantable defect caused an accident, but now the car is seriously damaged due to said accident, what if anything will the manufacturer do?I don’t know yet


 bcohen2010:

Even if the car itself malfunctioned, due to a design flaw or manufacturing defect, you probably got ticketed by the police,


My best guess, from afar, is that the engine stalled, based on this:



 merle30:

my brakes failed and steering was extremely hard


More than likely, the power assist for the brakes and for the steering were compromised by an engine stall situation.  GM has been marketed this Daewoo- designed vehicle as both a Chevrolet and a Buick for several years, but the quality of its ultra-cheap design is highly suspect.
I sincerely wish the OP an equitable resolution to this problem, which is almost surely the result of poor design.   I really hope that GM assumes some responsibility for the design of this cheapo vehicle’s design defects.Thank you and I hope so tooYour car stalled and you lost the power assist for your brakes, but your brakes didn’t fail. If this happens again, press the pedal as hard as you can, possibly even with two feet.Yeah, car stalled, brakes didn’t fail.  They were still there just with no assist.  Worse than the old manual brakes.  Happened to me too going 70 on the freeway when the belt broke.  Steering was a killer-worse than brakes.  So at any rate when you complain to the dealer, focus on stalling at 40 and not the brakes so they know what to look at.The power brake booster retains vacuum after the engine stops, the power brakes should operate for two applications after an engine stalls.
I have observed a couple dozen of these complaints, the brakes only fail during an emergency situation and the investigation comes up empty, the brakes are operational and the condition cannot be replicated. Customers complaining of brake failure without a collision is a less frequent occurrence.I’m just letting people know what happened to me and I’ve read of other similar situations were the vehicle shut down while drivingTrax has vacuum assist hyd brakes? That don’t work? Was it designed in Asia? Thought they were smart?",,,,
467,2016 Hyundai Tucson - Cheap window regulators,Maintenance/Repairs,11,854,"I have a 2016 Hyundai Tucson Limited that has 44K miles.  I live in Florida and have frequent window regulator problems, told by the dealership that the heat affects the cheap plastic part.  I was also told that there was no recall as this doesn’t affect more than 10% of the cars.  Well, I’m curious how many of you who live in warm areas have this problem?The chance of many people who have this problem responding is really low.  You might go the carcomplaints.com 3 web site and see what is there . Also maybe an auto glass shop might have a real solution.


 KA19:

I was also told that there was no recall as this doesn’t affect more than 10% of the cars.


That could easily be true. My wife drives a 2016 Tucson Sport that we’ve owned for most of a year and it hasn’t had that problem. Granted, St. Louis isn’t Florida but it does get fairly warm–88°F at the moment.


 KA19:

Well, I’m curious how many of you who live in warm areas have this problem?


Is there more than curiosity here? Or are you looking to see if someone has a fix for this? Or starting an online petition?
I’d suggest a Tuscon forum… there is a forum for EVERYthing it seems… as someone there may have a similar problem and figured out a fix.
I checked RockAuto and found no replacement window regulators at all. That tells me this isn’t a large problem or the aftermarket would have jumped in to make and sell cheaper regulators.
Just how many replacements have you HAD in the 4 years this car’s been on the road?Rockauto has it under “window motor” ($50) and Advanced Auto Parts sells them for $60 under “window regulator”.I must have missed that on Rockauto. Thanks.


 KA19:

I was also told that there was no recall


That is because recalls are normally done only for safety or emissions-related issues.
However, if you elevate your complaint to the corporate level (contact information can be found in your Owner’s Manual), it is possible  (not necessarily likely, but… possible) that a politely-expressed request for help with a frequent repair might result in some financial assistance.I have the problem and live in Florida with my Tucson it has unfortunately affected all four windows with the same issue. I’ve have my water pump replaced with this car and my issues with ABS light witch occurs frequently in this model.The water pump and abs light are not connected. Check the fuses first.


 Barkydog:

The water pump and abs light are not connected. Check the fuses first.


I may be over cautious but if the water pump fuse is blown, the water pump should be replaced (Does Hyundai really use electric water pumps?)
As for the warranty replacement of the broken window regulators, customers view this as more than an inconvenience having to visit a dealer each time one fails, there is a feeling of insecurity if the vehicle must sit outside overnight with a window that won’t rise.Sorry if I was not clear, I meant check the fuse for the power windows,I think these are cable operated regulators and cable ones seem to be more problematic than the scissor types. I doubt heat has anything to do with it and it’s highly doubtful there would be a Recall over side windows unless it involved manufacturing flaws in the glass itself.",,,,
468,2017 Toyota Corolla - Bumper scrapes,Maintenance/Repairs,10,355,"the front bumper scrapes at times when pulling in the driveway.  Is there anything that I can put under there?  Or I’m ready to get rid of the car.  I would prefer to move, lolGo slowly when entering your driveway so that the suspension won’t compress too much or park the car backward. If the driveway is made of asphalt,you can try to fix the low spot with cold asphalt(available in bags). If its made of concrete,there is no solution.Pulling in at an angle might help.Most modern cars have this issue. Around my town, pieces of the underpanel can be found in most shopping center parking lots.
Rubbing is not such a big issue. Leaving parts behind is.There are rubber ramps that you can buy to bridge a high curb. When I say high curb, I mean in the driveway. My daughter’s neighborhood has that, and some of the neighbors use the ramps. Here’s an example:

Also, pulling in at an angle helps.Those rubber ramps look nice.  They didn’t have those 40 years ago when we had a similar curb system.  So everyone just had the asphalt ramp.Our neighborhood has deep rolled curbs and many neighbors have installed these, they work great.


 jtsanders:

For what it’s worth, there’s no way I’d buy something like that and put it on public property in the street. The chances of being sued by a pedestrian who trips over it in the dark or a bike rider who hits it and crashes are too high for me. Also, I’d imagine that the snowplows and leaf vacuum trucks could easily damage it.


 lion9car:

For what it’s worth, there’s no way I’d buy something like that and put it on public property in the street.


Like I said, in my old neighborhood, everybody had them in their driveways.  The idea was when the curb was poured, then houses were built, there was no need to rip up the curb for a drive way cut out, and no way to anticipate where a driveway would be.  Nobody liked them but they really were necessary and never caused any problem for walkers, bikers, or the plows.  Otherwise you’d be driving over the curb every time.  No worse than mailboxes sticking out.  Now that can sting.  Of course you could always pay to rip the curb out and pour a new landing, but nobody wanted to spend the extra couple thou to do it.


 lion9car:

Also, I’d imagine that the snowplows and leaf vacuum trucks could easily damage it.


We don’t have leaf vacuum trucks and the snow plows never get closer than a couple of feet from the curb. If they scraped the gutter, the square curbs would all be badly damaged and the snow plow blades would need replacement frequently.",,,,

471,Fixing paint damage on car door,Maintenance/Repairs,4,182,"After having to wait about 2 months to drive my car due to an injury, I just started driving again this week.  However, this week I also discovered that someone had chipped off a tiny spot of paint on one of the doors.
I did not see it actually happen, but it looks like whoever did it knew and then tried to wipe at it, smudging the dirt in that area. I think it was likely one of my apartment neighbors, but they did not leave a note and I don’t expect they will fess up even if I approached them. (The first week they moved in, they were barbecuing directly underneath my balcony, and didn’t think it was a big deal when I pointed out it was a fire hazard and the smoke was clearly coming straight into my apartment!)
I’ve never had something like this repaired, so I’m curious what it would involve and what it might cost?  I am not prepared to fix this myself, so I would need to take it to a body shop.  The car is pretty new, just purchased last December, and this the first damage to the car.

I’d rather avoid DIY options for now, though a friend suggested using a Sharpie, since it’s a black car 
I know this is just one of those things that comes with having and driving a car – especially parking it near other people’s cars – and my old car had all sorts of scrapes and damage to it from parking it on the street.  I guess it’s the principle of the thing, that it’s a pretty new car, this is the first damage done to it, and they didn’t leave a note.  But I guess most people don’t.
I also noticed there is some damage to the right front door handle, so I think they may have done this on a few occasions. 
Thanks!You can get a “touch up pen” with matching paint from either the dealership or an auto store. Some of these have tips that works much like a Sharpie and allows fine control of delivery. If you buy one at a dealership and ask nice one of their people even might show you how to use it, for less time than trips to a body shop - it’s truly about as easy as using a felt tip pen.
There are services that perform small jobs like this at your home or workplace, recently a neighbor had a whole door repaired and repainted in his driveway and received a decent job.

472,Am I screwed? (about my f-150),Maintenance/Repairs,10,456,"Hi there!
I have a very important question, am I screwed?
I have a 2010 F-150 stx 4.6L 4x4, and the transmission is slipping, it’s not terrible and it happens more when under load or going up steepish hills. The fluid hasn’t been changed or flushed. My question is should I change the transmission fluid or should I keep it how it is? I did take it to a shop and the mechanic said the fluid level was fine, but he found little metal particles in the fluid which doesn’t sound good to me. I have heard a few stories about people who had slipping tranies on their car/truck, and days after changing the fluid the transmission died. Is this true? have y’all heard anything similar?  Is there anything I can add to the fluid that will help it and ACTUALLY WORKS? Should I do a trany flush? or do I have to get a transmission rebuild/ replace?
Thank you for all of your helpNever do a transmission flush.  Always do a “drain and fill” which means remove the pan, replace the filter and gasket, and then refill with new transmission fluid of the proper type.  It is normal to find some metal shavings in the transmission pan of a high mileage transmission.  Changing the fluid cannot hurt, and may help.  This, of course, assumes that the correct type of transmission fluid is used, and that it is refilled to the proper level–use of the incorrect fluid, or being low on transmission fluid can cause slippage/delayed engagement.Is the transmission fluid level low?  You should change it anyway, but low level or fluid breakdown may cause those problems. If the transmission fluid is black and smells burned, then it has broken down.The level was not low and the fluid was still pinkThat’s an indication the transmission is done.



 bcohen2010:

Always do a “drain and fill”


Pat Goss talks about Transmission Flushes
TesterWell folks, he said the fluid level was fine and color was good BUT there were particles in the fluid PLUS some slippage.  I’m not an expert or a mechanic but I have bought my share of transmissions, and particles and slippage means the clutches are breaking down so bye bye transmission.  It will need to be rebuilt.  I can’t say whether draining or not would help but doubt it.I had a flush by the dealer at 30k, all is good. That is what they do, nice to get all the fluid changed instead of just half. imhop.Changing the fluid will not hurt the transmission at this point but I think the transmission is done. Those who claim that changing the fluid killed their transmission should realize the trans was on borrowed time anyway and it was going to give up; fluid change or no fluid change.
The vast majority of transmission failures are caused by just what you refer to in regard to your own transmission; lack of regular servicing. Service the trans every 30 to 35k miles and the trans should last the life of the vehicle unless major league towing is involved.OK Thanks for the help! However I’m still kind of a newbie, what exactly do you mean by regular servicing? Is it just getting the fluid and filter changed or is there more to it than that?If you pour in a bottle of Lucas transmission additive you might get a few more weeks or months before it folds up. But folding up seems a certainty in the near future. That additive drastically improves the friction in the clutches which are just about shot.It’s 10 yrs old. Miles? Original owner? Servicing on newer rigs is drain/fill and pan drop and filter change if you can do it. Many trucks have a removable trans pan. 50k interval might be 2 yrs or 4 yrs.

The pictures look good for NY. Very little rusty stuff.Cleaning the corrosion on the clamps and battery terminals is almost a routine maintenance item.  On the 2011 Toyota Sienna I used to own, I had to clean the cable clamps and battery terminals about every two months.  The battery in my Sienna, which I purchased new, had an outgassing problem around the terminals.  The problem began after the vehicle was off warranty. I bought a device that plugged into an outlet in the vehicle to maintain voltage to the computers, radio settings and clock.  I have a terminal puller and a wire brush designed to clean the clamps and battery posts.  I also bought a spray that I sprayed on the battery connections after I cleaned them.  The whole procedure took less than 10 minutes.  When the battery failed and I bought a new battery, the replacement didn’t have the outgassing problem.

Nobody should put up with this, if a battery is leaking, causing damage to the battery clamps, it should be replaced. Battery cleaning maintenance is a thing of the past.

While I felt nothing and was unaware of the touch, it was a strong enough touch to cause the other vehicle to move visibly on the camera surveillance. The other driver was notified and escorted to the street to inspect her car for damage, and while no damage was found, I was notified and advised that this kind of careless parking is not acceptable.
I am embarrassed that I’m not as good a parallel parker as I thought I was, but I’m having trouble accepting that this is a big deal. I’ve asked around, and opinions seem to be split based on a couple of factors: urban/suburban and old/young. I used to live in a large urban area (10.5 million people) where the lack of available spaces and the need to take any space where you could squeeze in led to parking by Braille being completely normal. I now live in a suburb where people drive by spaces that are only six feet longer than their cars. And, being old, I learned to drive when cars had real bumpers, not pieces of plastic.
So now I need to be educated: Is gently touching another car while parking a big deal?
Does it depend on where you live?
Has it changed over the years because cars have changed?
Am I just an idiot who wasn’t brought up right?Bumping another vehicle while parking is not acceptable at any age or location . You seem to not understand you made a mistake . We all can make mistakes but the thing is to not blame anyone or anything else.
What if it had been your vehicle that someone backed into ?Yeah, back up till you ear glass they used to say. Newer cars with backup cameras and warnings are sweet. Had wifes old van a number of years ago, so many dings and bells every time you started the car I was backing out f a space and hit a bollard not visible in rear view or side mirrors. Maybe in NY City people accept bumper scrapes and dings as part of life, but I avoid bumping cars as a priority.

Me too!  But I avoid bumping into someone else rig.


 SusanDupuis:

Am I just an idiot who wasn’t brought up right?


No, you’re not an idiot.



 SusanDupuis:

Those “pieces of plastic” are actually supported by steel, and that steel is backed by  materials that can absorb relatively minor impacts that the so-called “real bumpers” of yesteryear could not absorb.  However, backing into another modern vehicle can leave surface scars on the plastic facing of the rigid bumper.
Additionally, it is possible that you could have damaged the “park pawl” in the other vehicle’s transmission if you hit it hard enough.  And, before you try to assign blame to modern technology, damaging the “park pawl” of a transmission by hitting a stationary vehicle was a potential problem even in the days before the “plastic bumpers” of the modern era.



 SusanDupuis:

Is gently touching another car while parking a big deal?


No, it is not a “big deal” as long as you haven’t caused damage to the other vehicle’s transmission or its plastic bumper facing. In any event, I hope that you can accept that you were at fault, and that the owner of the other vehicle was not at fault.
Perhaps you should consider a newer vehicle that is equipped with a backup camera and with audible warnings when you are getting too close to the vehicle behind you.   Modern technology can save you from all sorts of embarrassing and damaging situations.
I am going to go against the grain here and say that I feel really sorry for the younger generation, coming of age when there are surveillance cameras everywhere, and you can’t get away with sh**.
When I was a teenager, there were obviously surveillance cameras inside banks, stores, and other businesses, but very rarely were there any monitoring the parking lot, and certainly there were not any monitoring public streets.  The camera footage was low-resolution at best, and usually recorded on VHS tapes, and depended on a live security guard watching a wall of monitors to see something and focus his attention there.
Now, there are cameras everywhere, not just on private property, and the resolution has gotten to the point that a camera hundreds of feet away could read the serial numbers on a dollar bill in your hand.  The footage is stored in digital form on remote servers, and analyzed in real time by powerful computers.  It is no longer the decision of a human security guard to focus his attention to a particular screen–AI with facial recognition technology is watching and it never blinks.
Back to the topic at hand, when we were younger, we all bumped someone else’s bumper while parking, or accidentally opened a car door too fast and dented someone else’s car.  The only difference was that the eye in the sky wasn’t watching and tracking our every move.  And, of course, we hopefully learned to be more careful in the future.Susan , what do you have as a vehicle ?  We have to use a hospital 7 layer parking garage and when we go there we take our small vehicle instead of our station wagon just so we have less chance of damage to or by our car.Europeans living in cities have done this for years. More than just taps, they will actually nudge the space bigger.
Doesn’t mean it is right.
This time was a harmless tap, next time it causes damage that isn’t reported. That is why you were talked to. It isn’t acceptable.This is unacceptable. First, you could easily crack or scratch the paint on the bumper. If you did that to my car, which is in excellent condition with no dings or scratches, I’d be mad. Second, many bumpers have expensive sensors installed that aren’t built to handle any kind of impact, so they could be damaged. If you can’t park without hitting the car behind you, you need a car with a backup camera.


 bcohen2010:

I feel really sorry for the younger generation, coming of age when there are surveillance cameras everywhere,


Yeah amen to that.  I’m not so sure it’s legal unless signs are posted.  You can’t tape a conversation without the other person knowing but you can film them?
But yeah, my bumpers are painted and I inspect and repair any damage to the paint, so I wouldn’t appreciate someone scuffing up my bumper.  Same thing for door dings.  Don’t touch my car.  Still I’d tell the guy with the eye on the film to get bent and sue me.  He can’t though because he has no standing, just a screaming bystander.  The girl that got hit can’t either because there was no damage.
I just wish people would relax a little.  One my one year old Olds with heavy chrome bumpers, at a stop light a kid slid into my rear bumper on ice.  Yeah he put a ding in it that I didn’t like that was there until I got rid of the car ten years later.  It would have required a new bumper.  Stuff happens.  We both just went on out way.The difference is that today we live in a society where the threshold between a big deal / not a big deal has shifted. Now everything is a big deal. Years ago I was rear ended while driving a company car and the lady put a dent about the size of an egg in the old style chrome rear bumper. I took her name and number but I really wasn’t that concerned. My boss asked me what I would’ve done if it had been my car. I told him I would’ve done the same thing, which was absolutely true.
If you simply nudged the other vehicle chances are very good there was no harm done but you might want to be more careful next time. Personally, when I’m parallel parking I open the driver’s door and lean out since I don’t have a backup camera.

Now everything is a big deal.


I picture Lucy in the Peanuts comics screaming “you touched me, agggggh, you touched me!!!”


 SusanDupuis:

And, being old, I learned to drive when cars had real bumpers, not pieces of plastic.


Every used car from the 1960’s and early 70’s that I bought had damaged chrome bumpers. It seems that people were more reckless and careless when cars had “real bumpers”.
The bumpers on my 2000 Dodge are flawless, I don’t push cars out of my way.If you backed into another car hard enough that the security camera could see the other car move, that is more than a touch and I don’t see how you could feel it.
As far as cars with ""real""bumpers that were impervious to small hits, you have to go back to the early 30s to find spring steel bumpers designed with some give,
I read an early court case from the 20s where a judge dismissed a case against a motorist who backed into another with the words "" That is why they are called bumpers.
Those days are long gone. Anyone who grew up in a rural area knows that rudeness correlates to population density.


 SusanDupuis:

Is gently touching another car while parking a big deal?


Yes. Don’t ram into other people’s stuff at any speed. It’s a big deal any time you hit something with your car whether you cause damage or not, because it means you aren’t driving well and haven’t learned where the edges of your car are. Sure, maybe this time you got lucky and didn’t cause damage when you hit something, but next time you may not be so fortunate - and the kid you hit might not be very lucky either.
This is a safety issue, and just because you got away with it this time doesn’t mean it’s acceptable to keep going without addressing the cause of your mistake.



 SusanDupuis:

Does it depend on where you live?


No.



 SusanDupuis:

Has it changed over the years because cars have changed?


No.



 SusanDupuis:

Am I just an idiot who wasn’t brought up right?


I won’t say you’re an idiot, but if you think it’s OK to run into other people’s cars, then you definitely need to do an ethical recalibration.
All that said, what you’re doing isn’t uncommon. People who live where they have to park on tight streets often deploy big rubber guards over their bumpers because they know their car is gonna get tapped by other parkers, and they also know those parkers aren’t going to fess up unless a security camera catches them.
And THAT said, just because a lot of people do bad things doesn’t mean you’re cleared to join them. You should do some practice in an empty parking lot to figure out how to get the front and back of your car close to stuff without actually hitting it. Also, you can get an aftermarket backup camera if your car doesn’t have one, and that will help you know if you’re about to hit something in the rear. You can also have parking sensors added to the front and rear of your car, which will help keep you from hitting something on either end.

Any help out there?If it has fuel, spark and compression, the only thing left is timing.  Did you confirm that the fuel is gasoline and check the fuel pressure?  I knew someone who poured antifreeze into a gas can, forgot what he had in there and poured it into his tank.If the catalytic converter is clogged, air can’t enter the engine which can cause a no start condition.
Clogging
When the substrate within the converter melts either the platinum-palladium coating or the aluminum oxide honeycomb material, it forms an impenetrable slag, which blocks off the exhaust flow, clogging the passages. This creates a severe back pressure that affects engine performance. A clogged converter can cause rough idle, engine hesitation upon acceleration, weakened power, hard-starting and, in some cases, a no-start condition. Faulty components that cause overly rich fuel-air mixture, like cracked distributor caps, faulty EGR valves, incorrect timing or dirty fuel injectors can all cause melting. This symptom can be diagnosed by using a vacuum gauge on the intake manifold, or an exhaust back-pressure pressure gauge before and after the converter.
TesterTry spraying some starter fluid into the intake and see what happens then. If that doesn’t get a reaction from the engine I would then check the ignition timing.I suspect despite ur claims that one or more of spark fuel compression or timing is missing.

Any help or guidance is appreciated.
Best
SenthilFrom the codes,  it’s a 4 cylinder.
And from the codes, and with the mileage on the vehicle, I would look at a problem with the timing chain system.

Tester+1
The timing chain is definitely stretched at 200k miles, a good chain replacement interval is 150k for most cars with timing chains.I thought that the chain was normally good for the life of the engine? And that timing belts need to be replaced, but timing chains are good for the life of the engine?A timing chain can last the life of the car but that depends upon how often the oil is changed and how often the oil level is checked and kept up to the FULL mark.
What about spark plugs? You changed the coils but never mentioned the plugs. Old spark plugs can kill coils. Just my opinion, but new coils should always get new plugs at the same time.
Was the engine running smooth at the time the CEL came on and died? I have to assume it was not and you were continuing to drive it: which brings up why? I still have other questions but…Thanks, I never done this but will check fo how to videoI replaced all 4 spark plugs and replaced coils as it started failing. Now showing all 4 engine miss fire, I am hoping this is less expensive coils I bought it in Amazon… 4 coils for 50$. It started failingOk4450 when I started first attempt it shook and wasn’t moving and after i started again It ran smoothly but when slowed down it was little shaky and continued to drive and check engine light flashed and it stopped at red light.


 Dappersworth:

incorrect…as @ok4450 points out timing chains typically last the life of the car when oil changes are done on time and the oil level is kept full. I just changed the valve cover gaskets on my 09 Focus at 209k miles, the top of the timing chain looked fine and didn’t show any signs of stretching, teeth looked good too.The starting, runs rough, and then ran fine upon a restart could point to a loss of residual fuel pressure while the car is sitting which could mean a failing fuel pump check valve. About 10 years ago my daughter’s Mitsubishi had a similar problem and it turned out to be the fuel pump. But keep in mind that similar symptoms do not mean similar causes.
The random misfire could also be due to a failing crank position sensor. That can happen without setting a code. I tend to lean towards this one but that’s only a guess from my vantage point.
The ran fine, slowed down, and was shaky could point to an Idle Air Valve or either of the above although I tend to dismiss the IAV part of this.
As for chains, I’ve never had to replace a chain on anything I’ve ever owned in spite of running all of my cars to 250k miles and far more. Even my long gone 87 Mercury’s chain was fine at 410k miles when I sold the car and it still ran well and carried 160  PSI of compression on all cylinders. The common denominator in them all is 3k to 4k oil changes. However, I do not know the maintenance history on your car.Thank you for the info… I replaced oil regular basis… and i have been managing all by myself… all these issues started when radiator blew up and i had replaced it… this is what trigger all sorts of issue… until then this car was running fine… i want to keep this car as long as i can and drive… I replaced coils and tried to start no luck… its cracking but doesnt start… I see engine shaking if I continue to hold the key in turned position but doesnt start… I have uploaded cranking audio and  gif.

Audio sounds terrible, perform a compression test.I agree with Nevada 545. I think your chain may be shot. The cranking sounds like your chain has jumped a tooth. As much as I would like to agree with everyone about changing the oil regularly and it’s true for sure, but a badly overheated engine(running it even for a few seconds very low or no coolant) will kill a timing chain. Senthil, you said yourself that these issues arose after the radiator busted open. If you crank the engine long enough the chain mày jump back and it would start and run and then just like that jump a tooth and quit and not restart. If you decide to put the money into it make sure you swap out the valve seals as well. While it was running it probably blew a little blue smoke when you first started it, those were the valve seals going bad. If you’re messing with the timing chain might as well get them too.

489,Chevy Silverado wheel caps that pop off,Maintenance/Repairs,3,6.6k,"2000 Chevy Silverado w 16"" wheels.
The design of the wheels is that around the center of the wheel there’s a cap that covers the 6 lug nuts.  The cap is shaped like a hat and has the Chevy bow tie in its center.  The cap is held on by 6 black bolt looking covers that screw over the outside threads of the lug nuts.  The black bolt looking covers are part of the cap, they’re molded into it and can’t individually be removed.  They’re also plastic and they’re absolute crap.
Bought the truck new and all was well until around 06 or 07 I started noticing how those black bolt looking covers would be loose.  One or two here and there, at first.  By the time I’d get around to a tire rotation or tire change, they’d be taken care of.
The past couple of years though I can’t keep the caps on.  A sharp turn at a high speed and all but one or two will come loose by the time I get to where I’m going.  On a couple of occasions I’ve lost the cap completely.  It happened once while going through a round-about at normal speed.  It popped off and rolled across the asphault and up onto the sidewalk.
To stop this, I’ve had all the lug nuts replaced last year because their outside threads were corroded and worn down after 11 years.  I also replaced a couple of the caps since getting the new lug nuts and still those come loose too.  I keep a socket wrench in the truck to occasionally tighten them up and by occassionally I mean two to three times a week.  Sometimes I can tighten them, sometimes they just won’t go back on.  It would seem that after new lug nuts and a couple of new caps with brand new black covers, that the problem is bigger than just those things… maybe the wheel itself is the problem?
What to do?
Initial thought was to just buy a different model set of wheels from GM for that same era.  Dealership says that all the GM products for that truck in that size wheel will involve the use of those plastic black covers that will either keep a flat cap or hat cap over the lug nuts. Maybe that would be ok for another few years???  Also tried National Tire and Battery but wasn’t impressed with what they said to check out on their website with their wheel visualization program.  They all look too flashy, too sporty, or too low rider’ish for a straight-forward, Mom and apple pie no frills pick up truck.  Have also wondered if it could be an alignment issue or could it be something that could be cured if there were longer lug nuts with outside threads that would stick out a little further thereby making more, deeper contact with the center cap.  It would also allow the center cap to “float” a little above the wheel cover and not be pushed by the wheel until it pops or loosens.
Any thoughts? Thanks.chrome wheel common problem for chev. the simplest fix is to hold center tight to wheel and scribe around with marker. grind the center down. use non hardening permatex to secure nut threads. the problem is center of chrome warps outward after 4 or five years age.I have the same exact truck, in “work truck” trim.  The decorative hubcaps are not the problem.  The problem is that someone is overtorquing the plastic nuts, causing them to split or strip out, so they won’t properly tighten to the actual lug nuts on the wheels.
You can buy a set of 4 new genuine Chevrolet decorative hubcaps online for less than what the dealer charges–I think I paid about $60 with free shipping.  If you don’t care about the Chevrolet logo, there is a version where the center is just a glossy black circle, for about $40 with free shipping.  Just be careful to use a nutdriver when tightening the plastic nuts, and don’t overtorque them.I found that the problem is the plastic cap is barely attached to the wheel nut by only 2 turns.  So to repair this first make sure the plastic caps are in good shape and replace them if stripped or cracked.  Next take the center caps off the truck ( you might have to remove all the plastic caps) and shave 1/4 inch off the back of the center cap where it touches the wheel.  I used a small cutoff wheel on a dremel tool, wear eye and ear protection because it gets loud and there will be a lot of plastic flying around.

490,Manual 1998 Toyota Corolla sounds like an automatic,Maintenance/Repairs,5,202,"My toyota conquest sounds like automatic when driving after changing gearsWow, so you have a Toyota with a manual transmission that ‘sounds like’ an automatic transmission when you shift gears.  That is a complaint I have never heard of before.  Have a passenger record this phenomenon and post the video.I’d like to hear it too. What exactly does an automatic transmission sound like? As a wild guess I’d say your transmission is low on oil or possibly has a bad bearing.I expect what the OP is experiencing is the clutch slipping. Thus, the engine speed and the car speed are not always in direct proportion. The slippage mimics a torque converter.

Too late now, but I would never buy a vehicle with ANY service light on, if it was simple or cheap, the seller would have had it repaired.
If you take your temperature and the thermometer says you have a body temperature of 103 degrees instead of 98.6, do you just replace the thermometer?i don’t understand your illustrationYou changed the sensors, sensors tell you what the problem is.
Example, an o2 sensor might be telling you the catalytic converter is bad.  Granted the sensor could have failed.
The point is: proper diagnosis is required.
In my body temperature example—replace the thermometer, the new thermometer reads 103, you have a fever that require diagnosis.


 Billyboy21:

the message “service system soon” came on.


How soon after you bought it did the message appear?Right away, when I was test driving it the message came on. Then took it to a local mechanic and he installed 4 new sensors and it still comes on. They reprogrammed it three times still doesn’t work!!!In that case I agree with @Purebred You shouldn’t have bought it in the first place. But now that you have you need to find a better mechanic because the one you have now isn’t doing you any good.What are these 4 new sensors ?They are for the tires, show low tire pressureAre there any codes stored in the OBD-II system?  Any other codes?  If the mechanic performed a diagnosis, there might be codes listed on his report.Maybe it thinks it is time for an oil change? Is it service system or service tire system?You need to read the tire pressure monitor fault codes. The new sensors may not be compatible or there could be a problem with one of the receivers.

The tire pressure monitor is a separate system from the Powertrain Control Module.Don’t people read their own posts?

493,Permanent Vacuum Gauges,General Discussion,8,265,"Hi, got some questions about permanently installed manifold vacuum gauges.
Years ago I had one in my Chevy van on the dash - worked great!  It was above the carb.  Installed one in my old Camaro (below the carb - in the console) and I keep finding an oily residue in the vacuum lines and the sintered bronze snubber in the barbed inlet of the gauge that tends to plug it up and slow the response - especially on the colder spring & fall days.
Questions:

what is this residue?  gas?
where is it coming from? (yes, the manifold, but why)
can I keep it out of the vacuum lines?
how can I stop it from plugging up the gauge?

Thanks!

The vacuum hose connected to the engine is a steady downhill run to the gauge. Make a loop in the hose that is higher than its connection to the carb at the firewall THEN drop down to the gauge. That should solve the problem.Quadrajet carburetor? If so, maybe the jet well plugs are leaking and gasoline vapors are making their way to the gauge after leakage into the intake manifold.If your vacuum port is near the EGR port, then oil fumes from the EGR are getting into the vacuum line.  Same if the vacuum port is near the PCV valve port.Thanks for your replies guys.  The carb is a Holly 4165 (spreadbore Rochester replacement) and the vacuum for the gauge and distributor advance is being taken off the port right next to the PCV valve connection point (see detail in photos here):

Holley Replacement Carburetors are engineering to improve performance and keep you emission legal.  The 0-6210 is a  Model 4165™ Spread Bore designed to fit several applications.  See application chart  below in tech resources for specific details.





The odd thing is that, now that I’m looking the vacuum connections that Holley shows - they connect the choke diaphragm to the port nearest the PCV valve inlet.  Mine is connected to the other port and the distributor / gauge signal is coming from the choke port. It’s been a long time, but my mechanic may have installed it that way after the rebuild years ago - true manifold vacuum.
What Holley shows as the Timed Spark Advance port up on the side of the carb - is capped!?
Houston, it looks like we’ve found the problem … !!!  Keith, looks like you nailed it!
What do you guys think?  Connect the choke diaphragm to the port next to the PCV valve to match the Holly documentation, cap the one beside it and move the vacuum advance / gauge connection to up on the side of the carb?
I’ll have to watch this one:

I don’t know why you’d want a vacuum gauge connected anywhere except to the manifold.Good point - I’ll have to see if there are any spare ports available so I can get the connection away from the carb.
That aside, in the video they mention the timed advance vacuum signal on the carb is opposite what we see in the manifold- not the desired connection for the gauge!The best place to take the vacuum is directly from the plenum just below the carburetor.  Never take it from a port on the carburetor.  You may need to drill and tap a hole to make a port.  If you drill a hole, best place is in front of and centered between the primaries.  You. may have to remove the manifold and carb to do this and make sure you don’t get any shavings into the manifold.Many thanks - time to put the long awaited plan into action!",,,,
494,"Electric problem, key fob not working",Maintenance/Repairs,20,2.1k,"I have a 2007 Lexus is250. I believe it has electric problems so I went to dealer they said they have to remove the dashboard to check all the electric wiring, which will cost me more then a thousand dollars. So I decided not to.
The problem is with the key Fob. I replaced the key fob battery and the car battery have more then 12v reading.
Right after when I turn off the car, the key fob will work for less then 30 seconds. So right after i turn of the engine I have to lock the car immediately otherwise it won’t lock via key fob. Which means when i turn off the engine it turn off everything, in modern car when we turn off the car it still uses some electricity to keep all the computers and key fob alive.
In my case it does not stay alive. That’s why i think my key fob is not working because my car doesn’t draw any electricity when I turn the engine off.
Anybody have any solution to fix this issue? I appreciate your response. Thank you.Are there any atermarket additions to the car? Remote start, alarm, radio etc.?Nothing aftermarket, everything is original in the car


 Anik_Islam:

Right after when I turn off the car, the key fob will work for less then 30 seconds. So right after i turn of the engine I have to lock the car immediately otherwise it won’t lock via key fob.


I am familiar with Smart Key operation on this vehicle. If the Remote Keyless Entry operation stops 30 seconds after switching off the ignition, when you return to the vehicle how do you unlock the doors?
Do the black buttons on the door handles work after the RKE has stopped working? Do the door lock switches on the door panels work long after the ignition has been switched off?All of the answers is noWhen i return to the car i have to unlock using the mechanical key even the black button on the door handles doesn’t help. But i never have problems starting the carNo the door panel lock switch doesn’t work after i turn of the carThat is troubling, both Smart Key operation and RKE do not operate but the door locks operate as they should when the ignition is on? Cycle them at least 5 times to see if each of the locks function and are not weak.When ignition is on only the lock switch on the door panel operator normally.  When i am sitting on the car and the ignition is on and If i push the lock or unlock button on the remote it does not do anything, but the little light on the remote light up every single push. So the only time when  remote works is right after I turn of the car. And it work of less then 30 secondsWith the number of computers involved with door locks and smart key operation this becomes a complicated system to diagnose, a Tech Stream dealer scan tool will be needed to perform diagnosis.I suggest you check the memory power fuse along with the rest of the fuses under the hood to make sure there aren’t any blown fuses. I suspect you will find that the memory fuse may be blown out.I am experiencing the same issue, only addition is that the trunk opening function and panic button are non responsive as well. I will check the fuses to learn were there maybe a fix. Don’t have the computer mentioned so will have to try to resolve via fuse trail for now.Do you own a Lexus?  If so, what year?  If not, what car brand, including model, and what year?  When did you replace the FOB battery, and did the no start condition start right after that?2007 Lexus IS250 4door, I do know that my door sensors are going out so not sure if there is some relation. I have check both the fuse panel and fuses on the interior and the engine compartment and no mini fuses are blown.
Someone mentioned to check a memory fuse but when I check the manual I am unable to find the part on the fuse panel listings.

Key fob has a new battery
Car battery is between
Fuses are all good
Does the red light on the Smart Key blink when you push/hold the unlock button?I assume that you only have one fob to test with and nothing responds on the car when you press any button on it. If that is the case I would suspect a bad fob or it needs to be reprogrammed to the vehicle.

495,Accidentally went into manual without noticing,Maintenance/Repairs,46,2.1k,"driving to class today in a 15min drive, at some point during it i accidentally knocking my car in manual without noticing, my music being loud i didn’t hear my car revving, i’m not sure what gear i was, what rpms i was at, or how long i was even in manual. but i noticed when my car starting running off and then a sensor came on for “low engine oil” and then following right after that my “alternator malfunction” sensor also came on and my car suddenly shut off and all i was able to do was roll to a stop on the side of the road. it wouldn’t start back and i had to go to class for my test. later after my class i came back and the car started just fine, no sensors showing or anything. the engine was definitely shaking more than usual but it seemed fine. i pulled out and drove maybe 10ft and maybe 15mph and both of those sensors came back on and my car just shut off again. i’m not sure whats wrong. any ideas?? It’s a Volkswagen Jetta 2011 TDIFirst, check your oil level. If it is very low - completely below the dipstick - you may have destroyed the engine. Bad day for sure but you DO check your oil level regularly, right??
You need to get the error codes stored in the car read out. Find a friend with a code reader and post the actual codes here in the format P0123.  If you can’t do your own work, have it towed to a garage. expect to pay for diagnosis and expect a large bill. Expect the worst, hope for the best.

What does that actually mean?



 Tucker_Manis:

a sensor came on for “low engine oil” and then following right after that my “alternator malfunction” sensor also came on and my car suddenly shut off…  i’m not sure whats wrong. any ideas??


Have you at least checked the oil level?
Modern vehicles can’t really over-rev because of their electronic engine controls, so although you didn’t do your engine any favors by driving at high RPMs, that incident–in and of itself–didn’t cause whatever problems you are now experiencing.
How often do you normally check your oil?
Does the engine consume oil?
Are you careful to replenish the oil as soon as it is down by 1/2 quart?
Do you use the oil that is specified by VW for that engine?Yes had my oil completely changed less than 2k miles ago. oil levels looked fine but maybe a little dark. when i went to check the oil white smoke came out of the dipstick hole. the car starts and will run but maybe for 15ft then the sensors go off and the car shuts downless than two months ago i had to pay roughing $1800 for my car because the owner before never changed the oil and it became sludge in the lines. everything was stripped and redone. new oil was out in. new turbo manifold. new everything. ran great, actually way better than it did because until all of a sudden today.


 Tucker_Manis:

oil white smoke came out of the dipstick hole


Well THAT isn’t good!  I can’t tell you what you broke over the internet. A mechanic needs to get hands-on, eyes-on and a scanner hooked to the engine’s computer to determine the problem.


 Tucker_Manis:

when i went to check the oil white smoke came out of the dipstick hole.


That is definitely not a good sign.   Have you checked the coolant level in the radiator?



 Tucker_Manis:

the car starts and will run but maybe for 15ft then the sensors go off


Well, if the sensors “go off”, that is a good thing!
I would be concerned if they went “on”.
That being said, the best advice that I can offer at this point is to have the car towed to a qualified mechanic.   Don’t attempt to start the engine, even if the sensors are “off” because there are multiple signs of major problems.I guess that’s my only option at this point. whenever i check the oil and it smokes. it was almost 3 hours after the incident happened because i had to go to my college classes in between. so i just had started it back up and actually just realized i checked the oil while my car was on. it was also very cold this morning so that could’ve been the reason for the “smoke” coming from it.… and, please bear in mind that “qualified mechanic” means NOT going to Midas, Meineke, Monro, Sears, Pep Boys, a tire shop, or–God forbid–AAMCO.    Have the car towed to an independent mechanic’s shop, preferably one that specializes in VWs.


 Tucker_Manis:

actually just realized i checked the oil while my car was on.


Check it again with the engine not runningI have a good shop i always go to that did the last work on my car! thank you! i’ll figure it outCoincidentally, I did that recently with my mother’s Jetta, but I didn’t push it that hard before I noticed, so I didn’t get any warning lights.
The lesson to be learned here is to pay closer attention to how your car is behaving, so you’ll notice it isn’t shifting gears.Does car have auto trans?
Don’t know what manual mode is for auto trans?it’s almost like a slap shift, i never use it.The 2011 TDI Jetta should have the 6 speed DSG dual clutch automated manual.  It’s not a traditional automatic in that there’s no torque converter. It’s basically an automated manual transmission where the clutch is operated by a computer (there’s no third pedal).  It shifts faster than a regular automatic and is nearly as efficient at transferring power as a manual, but they typically aren’t as smooth-operating as a regular automatic and tend to be less reliable.Have you checked to see if you still have an accessory drive belt, aka fan belt?sorry for wanting to get as much opinions on it as possible ? lolThe opinions will be the same as before. This car needs to be seen by a real mechanic. This is not going to be a driveway fix via internet advice to someone who doesn’t even know how to check the oil.
If you play your music so loud that you can’t hear your engine revving at full throttle, how are you going to hear a fire truck, police car or ambulance?Getting responses on a message board is a lot like fishing. You cast your line, then wait. I hope you find a sensible resolution to the issue you are experiencing. I’ll go back to lurking.Said i checked my oil less than a month ago. music was loud because it was 6:30am and i was try to get woke up for my finals exam. sorry i don’t have all the money and was seeing if possibly it could be almost a driveway fix. sorry me posting it twice offended you.",,,,

Given the vehicle’s age and how relatively few Mitsubishis are out there in terms of used engines, etc. it’s probably not worth fixing.

Did you check to see if there is oil, and if there is coolant?When the water pump failed, it probably destroyed the timing belt.
And since this engine is an interference engine. the pistons are hitting valves. Which is preventing engine from rotating in either direction.

499,"Toyota Camry 1997 LE, no crank, no start - gear box messed up",General Discussion,13,375,"Hello,
My car is Toyota Camry 1997 LE, 2.2L, 4 Cyl and have about 201K mileage. I did not drive the car for last 2-3 weeks. Yesterday, I last drove it in our parking lot. When I took it to parking position, I was not able to take the gear to P. It was stuck. After trying a few times I could take it to P. But in Dashboard it was showing L.
I tried to restart the car and change the gear to N or D and Park again. Every time, Gear was one but Dashboard displaying another, mostly L.
After that I thought to restart the battery. I did not have the right ranch. So, I could not unscrew it or restart it. I noticed that the is not starting anymore. Ignition was responding up to On and displaying lights on dashboard. There was a “tick tick” sound coming somewhere from front. Not sure, if it is from engine/battery/starter or where exactly from. However, turning the key to Start was not working at all. Eventually, it completely stopped working. Even when I put the key on or take it to On/Acc, no lights on dashboard or sometimes it is on very lightly. Car headlight is not turning on too.
I called AAA and they tried jump start. Jump Start helps to work the battery on and when I take ignition to On, dashboard lights get on.However, start is not working at all ! After they disconnect the jump starter, nothing is working. But if I put the key in, there is still that “tick tick” sound.
Can you please tell, what could be the issue in my car? What needs to be done ?
Thank youSounds like the gear shift cable was binding and broke, now the battery is completely discharged.I’m surprised AAA tried to jump the battery given your description.  In order for the starter motor to be activated by the key being turned to start, it has to see that the car is actually in neutral or park.  It seems to me that something is disconnected or out of adjustment from your gear shift lever to the transmission so that it is not actually in a gear that will activate the starter.  So something came loose or fell off.  You’re going to have to call AAA back and have them tow the car to a shop to have it looked at.  Just in my humble opinion.Thanks buddy. Any idea, how expensive it could be to repair ? Also, is this any time sensitive issue ? I mean will it be any difference, if I keep the car to mechanic now vs I take it after 1 month ?Thanks Bing. Any idea, how much it may cost to repair ? Also, is this any time sensitive issue ? I mean will it be any difference, if I keep the car to mechanic now vs I take it after 1 month ?


 shuvo_cs_170756:

Sounds like the Safety Neutral Switch/Range Sensor switch is bad.
I think if the cable was bad you wouldn’t be able to physically get the car into park.It’s not going to get any worse with age but just call a shop and as “Its Me” said, as about what the charge would be for a new park/neutral switch.It needs to be properly diagnosed first.  No one can tell you the cost until the problem is diagnosed.  As far as leaving it for a month or more to have it towed and repaired makes me wonder if you really need the car at all.  Maybe time to sell or junk it.So, is it Safety Neutral Switch/Range Sensor switch that needs to be replaced you think ? or  gear shift cable that needs to be replaced ?
It does  nor crank at all. I assumed,  it wold crank if it was Neutral Switch/Range Sensor switch. But I am not 100% sure.


 It_s_Me:

Sounds like the Safety Neutral Switch/Range Sensor switch is bad.
I think if the cable was bad you wouldn’t be able to physically get the car into park.


I’m leaning cable. If the cable breaks you can put the shifter in park, but the transmission won’t actually go into park. If I’m reading OP’s OP correctly, that’s what’s happening here. The reason the car isn’t starting is because it inhibits the starter when it’s in gear.


 shuvo_cs_170756:

gear shift cable that needs to be replaced


So, you think that gear shift cable that needs to be replaced ?if the ECM doesn’t know it is in park or neutral, the starter will not engage. Turning the key will illuminate the dash lights and such, but trying to start it will do nothing.   This is a safety measure to keep folks from starting their car while it is in gear and having it move unexpectedly.
If your shift cable is broke, and you can get the transmission into park- it can still start- assuming everything else is ok.
This sounds like multiple problems.  Are you sure the battery cables are clean and tight? when trying to “restart” the battery (not sure what that means,) you or AAA may have loosened one or both of the cables, causing extra issues now.  Check that.Count me in for shift cable, as well
Could even be the shift cable bushing itself . . . same result, shift cable doesn’t work properly
Being the car’s 23 years old, I wouldn’t be surprised if the shift cable bushing completely disintegrated, allowing the cable end to pop off of the shift arm on the transmissionThank you all. It was gear shift cable broken. After replacing the gear shift cable this is all fixed.",,,,
500,"2016 Jeep Renegade not starting, replaced cam/crank sensors, no codes",Maintenance/Repairs,14,392,"Hi all. I wanted to provide as much info as possible, so this ended up being a long post. I’m feeling really stuck and can’t “take it into the shop” in the traditional sense, so I deeply appreciate you if you make it to the end.
We have a 2016 Jeep Renegade Limited with just under 25k miles. I’m in Alaska and don’t live on the road system - it came on a cargo plane. We do have an auto shop here that sometimes has a mechanic, but there is not one there now and it could be months or more until we have one again. That being said, I do know a few people that are much handier than I am and could help with many things…my own knowledge on the other hand is pretty limited. We bought the car in July and it’s been great until now. We bought it at a dealership but actually had a chance to get in touch with the previous owner, and she said there were no issues she was aware of, she just wanted something different.
So onto the problem… a few weeks ago the engine wouldn’t turn over. Luckily I have an ODBII scanner and plugged it in. It gave me the P0340 and P0335 codes for the camshaft sensor and crankshaft sensor. I ordered them both, waited, and discovered that the camshaft sensor was the wrong one and didn’t fit. I replaced the crankshaft sensor and it started right away! It felt pretty good to be able to fix it.
Fast forward about 4 days, and it wouldn’t start again. I plugged in the ODBII scanner, and no codes at all this time. I unplugged the battery for about 20-30 minutes to reset the computer, and still had the same issue - no turning over and no codes. I decided to order the correct camshaft sensor. It arrived today, I replaced the old one, and it didn’t change anything. No turning over and a check engine light with no codes.
Another thing to mention is that before I replaced either sensor, the check engine light would turn on, blink for a little, and then go back to solid. After I got it going the first time (with replacing just the crankshaft sensor), there was no check engine light at all until it stopped turning over again. At this point it is doing the same thing as before: solid, blinks a little, solid. This is obviously with just having the car on, not fully started. I know a blinking light can mean a misfire, but I’m not sure how to determine that or what is causing it, especially since it was fine for a few days.
A few other things that may be worth mentioning…It’s already below freezing here, but I do have a block heater. I also have a trickle charger that has been able to charge up the battery no problem. A few weeks before the issue started, there was some gurgling from the muffler. My friend said it was likely the water byproduct in the catalytic converter and that it hadn’t gotten hot enough for it all to evaporate. Drives tend to be shorter here - maybe as short as 5 minutes total, plus warmup time. It’s a small village but big enough for tons of folks to have a car here. So I suppose there could be more water than normal collecting in there. This is probably a stretch, but I wonder if the water froze and is blocking the exhaust from actually leaving.
I appreciate any thoughts or ideas! Thanks so much for reading all of this!To clear up a little confusion here, turning over means the same as cranking.  if the engine is not turning over, there is no rrr,rrr sound from the starter.
I think you mean the engine is not starting.
Try spraying some starting fluid in the air intake, if the engine starts and runs briefly you have a fuel problem.  If not, you have an ignition or timing problem.If your engine is not starting for any reason, the check engine blinking probably means nothing whatsoever.  The check engine system goes through a self-test.  Don’t use that to try to diagnose the problem. If the car is running, then the check engine light will light and you can read a code.Ah, yep you are correct! I definitely had this misconception. It IS turning over, but it is not starting. I will try to get some starting fluid and report back.Okay, this is helpful and makes sense with what I am experiencing. Thanks!Ran ok and then no start. Any chance a critter chewed on wires?Measure the battery voltage while cranking the engine, weak battery voltage/slow cranking can set P0335 and P0340 fault codes.



 clm55:

the check engine light would turn on, blink for a little, and then go back to solid.


The flashing check engine light with the ignition on indicates that the OBDII monitors have not been completed, this is normal after erasing fault codes or disconnecting the battery.



 clm55:

A few weeks before the issue started, there was some gurgling from the muffler.


If the drip hole in the muffler is blocked, water can accumulate, freeze and prevent the engine from starting. You may want to inspect the drip hole and heat the muffler to thaw the ice.
Ran ok and then no start. Any chance a critter chewed on wires?

Boy I hope not! But I’ll try to check later today.

Okay I’ll give that a try. I feel like the fact that the battery can be charged by the trickle charger without any error messages should be enough for it to start at least once, even if it is ready for replacement. Is that maybe not true?



 Nevada_545:

Yeah I have space heater I could put under it for a while.What is the temp?
Is fuel moisture free? Where does the fuel come from? Are you inland? Coastal? Barges?I suppose you could ask the local mechanics if cars/ trucks have issues with drive issues based on seasons.
It’s November. I assume it is not -30f. Did your last car perform ok?

Its hovering around freezing but has been as low as 10 since it started and has been in the upper 30s recently. We are coastal and fuel comes on a barge. I have heard of some moisture issues before but never had a problem so it could also be hearsay. Our last car was a 2001 Dakota that had a ton of problems and we decided to sell it to someone who knew what they were doing. I have some Heet I could put in the gas tank but I’m not sure how much good it would do without being able to get all mixed up.2016 is a new car. A mechanic with a scan tool should be able to see why it’s not firing. Has spark. Has fuel. Motor is sound. If you literally are in a place with no techs then you are in a bind.So by some kind of magic it started again last night!
I realized I had never disconnected the battery after installing the second sensor. And actually I didn’t do that after initially installing the first (crankshaft) sensor - it started up right away after that.
So anyway, Monday night I disconnected the battery and forgot about it until Tuesday afternoon. I reconnected it, connected the trickle charger for a few hours because why not, tried it again and BOOM! It might have been on the second try that it started, and it took a little convincing when it did start, but it started. The RPMs also dropped after it started and I thought it was going to stop running. This could also be a normal thing that I hadn’t noticed before since last night I was really trying to pay attention to all that was happening.
So the besides disconnecting the battery, the only other change was that the temperature was near 40 yesterday, warmer than it had been. I’m glad it’s working again but I sure wish I understood what happened. Thanks for all the input in here and I’d love to hear any thoughts from y’all about what the problem might have been.Thank you for letting us know of your outcome.
I would suggest driving  it for a minimum of 20 minutes each time you use it to get all the fluids warmed up.  Though you drive very few miles, change your oil a minimum of twice a year.  In Alaska I would use 0-20 synthetic oil.  Keep a battery maintainer on it when not in use.
If your block heater is factory, check owners Manuel, see if it is sake to keep plugged in all the time when not in use.  I would be concern about an after market block heater.My kid had a Dakota and a renegade. He lives in Colorado and could not go above 12k’ elevation. Jeep would just die. Had altitude sickness. So he sold it. He gets a different rig every year. Sometimes more often. He is easily bored.",,,,
501,Car ignition messed up,Maintenance/Repairs,5,244,"I have a 2005 volvo v50 T5, I decided to clean the passenger side fuse box with electronic cleaner, I let it dry for about an hour and I forgot to hook the wires back into it before I turned the car on.

Now my key will not go all the way into the ignition and it will not go into the off position, it stops right before it. I can still turn the key to the right but the only thing that powers up is the ceiling lights. Anyone have any ideas how to fix this?

I bought it from a private seller and the only that should of been wrong with it was the battery and the steering angle sensor needed to be calibrated…well, turns out the car would not crank so I jumped the starter engine relay and it worked fine…so I thought it may of been something to do with fuses, thus I wanted to clean them…now I broke it even further lol.",,,,

503,The Worlds Fastest Indian,General Discussion,7,330,"Saw this little unknown movie this past weekend called “The World Fastest Indian”.
I don’t ride a motorcycle…but I found this movie very enjoyable. It came out in 2005 staring Anthony Hopkins.
Enjoy.



IMDb 4



The World's Fastest Indian (2005) - IMDb 4
Directed by Roger Donaldson.  With Anthony Hopkins, Diane Ladd, Iain Rea, Tessa Mitchell. The story of New Zealander Burt Munro, who spent years rebuilding a 1920 Indian motorcycle, which helped him set the land speed world record at Utah's...





Agree, wholeheartedly.  Very enjoyable picture and compelling story whether you ride or not.
Anthony Hopkins did his usual brilliant job portraying Burt MunroI saw it the year it came out, and not since then
So my memory’s not as fresh as yours, @MikeInNH
But I do remember enjoying it
I’m not into motorcycles in any way, so I’m not sure how much the story was “stretched” to make a good movie.
The part I particularly enjoyed was when Anthony Hopkins was fixing the cars on on George Lopez’s used car lot and got them all purring like kittens in no time flatI found the real Bert Munro even more compelling as detailed in the pages of Hot Rod magazine when he was setting the records. He dug holes in the sand of his yard to cast pistons from Ford farm tractor axles  and filed then round.

Many times the true story is better then the Movies. But I still thoroughly enjoyed that movie. I rented it from RedBox only because Anthony Hopkins was in it. Nice to be surprised. If I knew this movie was this enjoyable when it came out  then I would have made the effort to watch it in a theater. But I really don’t remember it. But then again it was 15 years ago and my memory isn’t what it use to be.Great movie. While not taking anything away at all from Munro, the guys back in the day who really had the cojones were the board track racers. Wool sweaters, goggles,  zero brakes, and on a track made of lumber with a 25 degree bank.
The Motodromes as they were called were also called Murderdromes and for a good reason. Many riders lost their lives as did a fair number of spectators who ended up in the way of an airborne motorcycle.
Some of those riders were paid 15 to 20 grand a year and that was a fortune back in the 19Teens and 20s. The sport started fading and was eventually killed off by the Great Depression but in their heyday drew crowds of 10 to 20 thousand people.
I can’t imagine going down at 100+ MPH on rough lumber. Asphalt hurts enough as it is.
Los Angeles Motor Speedway, April 24, 1921. Motorcycle Board Track Race
That was a good movie. I was really pleased to see that Hannibal Lecter was into fast motorcycles. 
I tried a velodrome once that’s since been torn down. That’s basically a motodrome for bicycles. Same high-banked wood plank track.  I was maybe doing 25 or 30mph and it was frankly scary as hell. Didn’t help that the track wasn’t planed totally smooth so my tires were kind of hopping around on the slightly uneven boards.  I can’t imagine doing it at more than triple the speed. Lunacy.

No, not on an 8 year old vehicle.  And not for leaks.
As far as the bad piston rings that cause oil burning, not leaking, the class action lawsuit has been settled and for your vehicle this is the repair authorized;


Applies to: 2012 model years

Provides: Free piston assembly replacement for seven years and six months or 120,000 miles, whichever comes first, after initial sale or lease.

Which means your car is past the settlement date. See the article linked.



classaction.org 1



Settlement Reached in Class Action Over Chevy Equinox, GMC Terrain Oil... 1
A settlement has been reached to end proposed class action lawsuits filed over excessive engine oil consumption in certain Chevy Equinox and GMC Terrain SUVs.





A quart in 1k isn’t that bad for a vehicle with 100k but the leak is troublesome. Have it looked at to determine the source of the leak and the approximate repair cost. At that point you can decide if it’s worthwhile to fix it as opposed to replacing it.If you can chase down the leak, get that fixed.
If the engine is burning a quart of oil every 1000 miles…oil is pretty cheap compared to an engine rebuild or replacement. I’m talking like quarts of jugs of SuperTech oil from Walmart.
If you can get the outside leak fixed, I’d just keep the oil topped off regularly and let it ride.


 20_201968:

Parking on street since it started messing garage floor.


I don’t think it’s very nice that you make everyone look at your mess so that you can keep your garage floor clean. Sending oil into the nearest storm drain is also not a very nice thing to do to the environment. Put your car back in the garage and put a drip tray under it.

505,Old Toyota Corolla general questions,Maintenance/Repairs,7,252,"Hi I am the proud owner of a 1079 Toyota Corolla wagon deluxe. It is a fun little car but has a few problems, other than being extremely slow haha. I have a few questions that some people may have the answer to. If not it’s okay!
First, my gas gauge is busted. I have ran out of gas twice which sucks. The needle stays limp and doesn’t do anything at all. What can I do to fix this? I cannot seem to find any fuel sending units for this specific vehicle, as parts are hard to come by, especially brand new ones.
Second, it is carbureted, and there is a little tube that pokes out the bottom of my little Weber 32/26 carb. Whenever try to fill the gas tank all the way, it spurts out a metric boat load of fuel. What the heck!? I am worried if I close this off it will pressurize or back up the system and pop something.
Lastly, all my tires have some poke to them. This was the previous owners decision, but I don’t know I kinda like it. What i DONT like is that the rear passenger tire pokes out about one and a half inches more than the drivers rear. There are no spacers, just a regular old axle that I suspect is not the original, hence the fact that it pokes out. Not sure what I can do to re center them so any tips would help me out a whole lot.
I do all of the work on this car myself but I am open to going to shops if it is beyond something I am capable of. Thank you for reading my post! I hope you all have a wonderful day!First, the gas gauge. Just keep searching is about all I can say. The internet is a big place. Search vintage Toyota forums, Ebay, the works. There may also be another sender that can be adapted. Toyota or Corolla forums may help.
Second, I do not know what “tube” you are referring to… a picture would help. I’d suggest the carb’s needle and seat need replacing because they are likely leaking. Carb kits and rebuilt carbs are available on RockAuto.com.
Third, by poke, if you mean the tires stick out, then the wheels are not factory nor are they the proper offset to fit the car. You need a wheel with more backspacing… the measurement from the bolt face to the back of the wheel rim. As for the resr axle being offset, if has been replaced, the panhard bar is too long or too short or the car is too high or too low or the bar is bent or the car is bent. Again, pictures would help. You may have to fabricate something to fix it.


 Ethankpublic_172225:

Hi I am the proud owner of a 1079 Toyota Corolla wagon deluxe.


That is really an old vehicle .Yeah, I think we can be confident that the warranty expired… long ago.
As far as the gas gauge, I had this problem with one car, I just filled it up by miles driven, every 150 miles or so.
I think Mustangman is correct, likely aftermarket rims with incorrect offset.


 Purebred:

+1
Unless the trip odometer has also stopped working, this is the very simple way of making sure that one doesn’t run out of gas.    Of course, it can also be done if the trip odometer is now dead, as long as the OP keeps a watchful eye on the odometer.The fuel spurting out when filling the tank is likely from the charcoal canister and I suspect you are ‘packing’ your tank. And it’s unlikely that a Weber carburetor was original equipment on that Toyota so improper vacuum sourcing is likely. As for the odd wheel spacing, it might be a critical error to ever get the front wheel mismatched and while not so critical on the rear it can be a severe safety issue on wet or icy streets at anything above bicycle speed.
But all that is just my opinion based on seeing all manner of automotive Frakensteinisms in my past. Maybe Igor can find some proper pieces to make the car safer and if properly installed a correctly assembled Weber can be a much better operating carburetor than a patched up original.


 Ethankpublic_172225:

a 1079 Toyota Corolla wagon deluxe.


Man, that IS old! 
Gas gauge: Probably gonna have to live with it. I don’t see the part on Rockauto so it’s probably not available anywhere unless you get lucky. Does the odometer still work? Fill up every 150 miles.
If the wheel on one side is sticking farther out than the wheel on the other side, and there are no spacers, then the guy who owned the car before you screwed up, and it’s not the aftermarket rims. Or at least, not entirely the rims, because if it were only the rims, they’d both stick out the same amount.
Be helpful if you could get us pics from under the car so we could see that rear axle.",,,,
506,2003 Chevy Astro issues,Maintenance/Repairs,21,766,"Hey everyone, first post here. I’ve been dealing with several issues with my Astro but one lately has me concerned. I bought a code reader because the service engine light has been on. Some of the codes it threw were crankshaft position sensor, camshaft position sensor, random/multiple misfire, system too lean, ignition coil B Primary/Secondary malfunction, mass air flow sensor, and O2 sensor. I just changed the crankshaft position sensor, but didn’t redo the wiring. The code has come back, along with the camshaft sensor. All the other codes are gone for the time being. When driving down the road, every once in a while, the van, while having foot on accelerator, bucks fairly violently, and doesn’t seem to respond well to the attempt to accelerate. Usually in response to that I let off the accelerator, coast for a little while, and try again. Eventually it stops acting up and goes back to normal but usually not for long. Sometimes it seems to snap out of it completely, and then other times it’s pretty persistent. The van definitely has a rough idle from time to time, to the point where it will die on me. Sometimes after reversing, sometimes after sitting for a while. I’m wondering if possibly fuel injectors might need to be cleaned or even replaced. The van is nearing 300,000 miles with mostly original parts because it wasn’t taken care of too well by the former owners. I just changed the alternator and battery in it. I’ve done a small tune up on it as well. New cap and rotor, new spark plugs and wires, new fuel filter, new air filter, new PCV valve, and I had to put an oil sending unit on it as well. Any guesses what might be going on? I’ve also considered that maybe it’s a timing issue and that it needs a timing kit? I’ve always heard though that typically timing chain issues just get worse and worse, not back and forth, which is what this is doing. Hopefully the people here can give me a few options to get to the bottom of this. Thanks!

                The acceleration problems with bucking and jumping are almost certain to be the result of failing fuel pressure and because it is intermittent the fuel pump is the most likely cause so I go for replacing the pump.
              
Once you cleared the codes…  what codes come back? Please post the actual code… Pxxxx and we will try and help.My old Chevy Astro would do this until I replaced the fuel pump.I cut an access hole in the floor board just above the fuel pump to replace it.I did not drop the tank because it was a pain in the neck.


 COROLLAGUY1:

I did the same to my Avalanche. Makes the change a snap.Right now it isn’t showing any codes. The codes kinda come and go. Usually it’s the O2 sensor, crankshaft sensor, and camshaft position sensor codes. P0335 is the one for the crankshaft, and P0341 is the one for the camshaft. When they pop back up I’ll take note of it and post them on here.Just checked it again and they are back. P0335 Crankshaft Position Sensor A Circuit and P0341 Camshaft Position Sensor A Circuit Range/Performance Bank 1 or Single Sensor. Definitely weighing a few things here to see if I can get to the bottom of this. I really don’t want to lose this van. I love this Chevy Astro.http://straighttalkautomotive.com/articles/multiple-codes-where-to-start-the-repairs.html 3
TesterThe acceleration problems with bucking and jumping are almost certain to be the result of failing fuel pressure and because it is intermittent the fuel pump is the most likely cause so I go for replacing the pump.Would it be good to check the fuel injectors as well? As far as the cam and crank, maybe timing or would all of that likely be because of an intermittent fuel pump?Well I didn’t want to post another question, and was hoping that last one would be answered, but I guess I’ll just replace the fuel pump and then go from there. If it doesn’t fix it I’ll just go ahead and post that with my question. Thankfully, I already have a brand new fuel housing assembly and fuel pump in box waiting to be put in. I’ll post the results of that. I’ll get around to that on Saturday, more than likely. Thanks again.

Don’t forget to cut an access hole in the floorboard above the fuel pump to take it out. Use some sheet metal screws to fasten the new metal piece. Get some roofing ciment to close the gap between your new piece and the access hole.If you think it will be tough to remove the seats and carpet to cut a hole in the floor just let the thought pass. Without a lift and a transmission jack removing the fuel tank is a real PITA and dangerous.This van does have CSFI . . . keep that in the back of your mind, if the fuel pump doesn’t solve all the problemsIt wouldn’t be tough to do that at all. The issue I’m more concerned about is that the Astro has a unibody. I have heard that cutting an access like that, even though some have done it, can lead to stress cracks, or compromised frame. I’m not entirely sure really. Other than that, my main concern was sealing it back up in a professional manner.Yes. So with that being said, if the fuel pump doesn’t in fact fix the problem I could have a clogged or faulty fuel injector(s)? One of the codes the van was giving for a while was random/multiple misfire so I was kinda thinking that might possibly be a problem but of course, not sure.


 botard89:

One of the codes the van was giving for a while was random/multiple misfire


speaking from experience . . . those P0300 random misfire codes are somewhat misleading
A smart guy who looks at live data and mode 6 data will soon determine it’s very often not random at all.  he’ll be able to determine exactly which cylinder is the problem
If I were you, I’d find out exactly which cylinder is the problem before doing a fuel pump
On the other hand, a bad crankshaft position sensor or fuel pump would affect all cylinders
I’m very familiar with replacing fuel pumps on Astros, and there are a few opportunities to mess up, and you will be absolutely hating yourself, when you have to do the job again, or even worse, have problems that didn’t exist before.  I won’t get too specific, but don’t fix what isn’t broke.
To sum it up . . . more testing is needed
Determine if the problem is affecting all cylinders . . . or just specific cylinders
Plan your repairs according to your finding(s)
'nuf saidI’ve never cut the floor to deal with a fuel pump myself @botard89 but I have seen well done jobs making such repairs and when you consider the center of the floor only bears the load that would be laying on it such repairs don’t weaken the uni-body structure.
But I do agree that ‘professionally,’ your situation would require some serious testing. I often “shoot from the hip” to suit the situation as I see it and “from the hip.” considering the time and cost of test equipment and the likelihood that the pump is the problem and if you have a drill and a get a pack of cutting discs you might somewhat quickly get back on the road.
But as always opinions vary.I can’t remember if I said this or not but I did swap out the crankshaft position sensor and still would like to swap the camshaft position sensor as well. Unfortunately, it didn’t fix the problem. The van seemed to run a little better for a little while, but afterwards it went right back to the same thing. I’ve noticed along with getting the speed up to around 50-60+ and it doing this, extended runs seem to bring it out as well. It’s almost like once it’s warmed up a good bit it wants to start with the jumping/skipping/bucking and basically I think that is a result of something in the fuel system acting up. I know the fuel gauge doesn’t work so at very least if I do put the entire fuel housing assembly in then hopefully it will give an accurate reading and if I’m lucky maybe the main problem will go away. I already have the part anyways so I don’t think it would be bad to go from there as well as get that camshaft sensor in too. If that doesn’t do it, I’d like to check the fuel injectors, but I’m not sure if those symptoms exactly line up with a faulty or clogged injector. We shall see though. I’ll try to look into performing some extra tests as well to better determine the issue at hand, and anything new I’ll try to remember to post here.


 botard89:

Yes. So with that being said, if the fuel pump doesn’t in fact fix the problem I could have a clogged or faulty fuel injector(s)?


Also don’t rule out boiling gas in fuel lines. If lines are too close to a heat source, and you’re missing a heat shield these symptoms can happen.


 botard89:

. I know the fuel gauge doesn’t work


What do you mean . . . ?
Your fuel pressure gauge . . . the tool . . . doesn’t work?
If so, then use another one
You need to use one of these kits with shut off knobs . . . so that you can determine if the pump is good and/or if there’s leakage from that point on, such as in the engine bay",,,,
507,Master Cylinder Bleed,Maintenance/Repairs,12,322,"First let me clarify I was having no brake issues.  I was simply doing a 200K miles maintenance and was changing brake fluid.  So before I started all worked fine.
I pumped out the reservoir leaving about 1/2 inch of fluid in bottom. (Same as on my wife’s car).  I refilled with new fluid to top. Replaced cap.
I then bled the lines in order recommended (rear drums first) and they seemed to go well, but when bleeding the front brakes my wife indicated the pedal was very spongy.  I finished up as normal but brakes are very soft.  After watching videos I decided to bleed the master cylinder.  I bought a bleed kit and bled it still installed. Lots a bubbles came out and the pedal hardened up and bubbles stopped.   I thought hey it’s fixed.  I closed up the MC  and cranked the truck and started to drive but problem returned…
I am curious if I can just bleed the lines now?  Or should I start over and bleed the MC again before the lines?
I have ABS module in middle of truck under the drivers seat.   But remember all was working well before I started so I find it hard to believe that I now have bad parts?
Thoughts?What year is this Chevy?
TesterI am going to guess you own a mid 2000s year truck (you don’t say)… so you should be able to change the brake fluid without exercising the ABS valves. I’ve done my 04 several time that way.
That said, if you introduced a bubble in tbe master, you should crack the master’s lines after bleeding the master. Break the lines loose enough for a small amount of fluid to escape. Use gravity only. If the pedal is still soft, bleed around the vehicle again. Gravity bleeding works as does the pedal or pressure method.
If you have the scan tool to cycle the ABS, use it. If you can’t get the system bled that way, it may take a trip to the mechanic. But I have never needed the scan tool.Yes it’s a 2007 (New Body) Silverado 1500 2WD.Ok so is this correct?


Bleed MC lines using gravity.  To be specific do I loosen both lines enough to leak and have partner press the brake pedal to force air out?  Do they hold the pedal in as I tighten the lines or do they release the pedal before I tight lines?  I saw a Scotty Kilmer video where he held petal down entire time as lines were bled and retightened.


After the MC bleed DO NOT crank truck or drive it.   Immediately bleed all 4 lines.


I do not have a scan tool .

Here’s the brake bleeding procedure when the master cylinder has been removed, reinstalled, or replaced.

Connect a scan tool to the vehicle.
Start the engine and allow it to idle.
Depress the brake pedal firmly and maintain steady pressure on the pedal.
Using the scan tool, begin the automated bleed procedure.
Follow the instructions on the scan tool to complete the automated bleed procedure. Release the brake pedal between each test sequence.
Turn the ignition OFF and remove the scan tool from the vehicle.
Fill the brake master cylinder reservoir to the maximum-fill level with GM approved brake fluid from a clean, sealed brake fluid container.
Bleed the hydraulic brake system.
With the ignition OFF, apply the brakes 3–5 times, or until the brake pedal becomes firm, in order to deplete the brake booster power reserve.
Slowly depress and release the brake pedal. Observe the feel of the brake pedal.
If the brake pedal feels spongy, repeat the automated bleeding procedure.
If the brake pedal still feels spongy after repeating the automated bleeding procedure inspect the brake system for external leaks.
Turn the ignition key ON, with the engine OFF; check to see if the brake system warning lamp remains illuminated.
If the brake system warning lamp remains illuminated, Do not allow the vehicle to be driven until it is diagnosed and repaired.
Drive the vehicle to exceed 8 mph/ 13 km to allow ABS initialization to occur. Observe brake pedal feel.
If the brake pedal feels spongy, repeat the automated bleeding procedure until a firm brake pedal is obtained.

To be specific do I loosen both lines enough to leak and have partner press the brake pedal to force air out?



Gravity, no pedal needed. Crack one line at a time and close them as soon as fluid comes out. Removes the bubble from the high spot.
Yes, don’t start it, don’t crank it. Bleed all 4 lines.
Then hope you can get the system bled without it.  If not, @testers procedure is the method you’ll need to use, and that will take a trip to the mechanic for you.

Before you do this, look carefully for brake fluid leaks near the ABS modulator. These vehicles are rather notorious for rusting out the metal brake lines down by the ABS modulator.
I’ve personally blown both front and rear circuits at the same time so it completely drained the master cylinder. My after-repair successful fill and bleed was as I described to you without cycling the ABS valves.
Good LuckOk guys thanks for help…  it’s fixed.  No leaks at ABS or anywhere.
Bled the MC with gravity.  Pedal tightened up.  Then bled each line.   I tried using a bleeder pump on first line but air just kept coming in around the valve.  I got some help and did the 2 man job where he pressed the pedal, I opened the valve and closed it before he released the pedal.  Did that a couple times per tire with no air and just solid stream of fluid.  It was more messy but I wiped it up.
Results = my brakes are firmer than ever before, or like new from factory.  Very happy!!Glad you were successful. Thanks for letting us know it is fixed.

That is how it must be done. You can’t release the brake pedal with a brake bleeder or brake line open without drawing in air.You can if you use a one man bleeder or just a hose from the bleeder into an elevated jar half full of brake fluid.  No second person necessary.

You can if you use a one man bleeder or just a hose from the bleeder into an elevated jar half full of brake fluid.


You would need to seal the bleeder screw threads will silicone paste or air will be drawn in when the pedal is released. Not much air but some customers can notice the difference in quality of the brake bleeding process.Have not noticed any difference, bleed seemed perfect to me.  Would Syl-Glyde work?",,,,
508,04 Hyundai Santa Fe “limp mode”,Maintenance/Repairs,10,24.5k,"I have a 2004 Hyundai Santa Fe with just under 97,000 miles on it. It’s a V6, 3.5L, AWD. I’m the second owner (parents were the first).
About two weeks ago I was driving down the highway during morning rush hour and the car seemed to loose power. (but not like it does when the alternator goes) and I had to pull over. The car wouldn’t go faster then 40MPH.  I finally pulled back out into traffic and got to work.
Checked the coolant - bone dry.  Filled up the coolant and it seemed to work.  (also added power steering fluid as that was low as well) Friend checked and replaced the gasket on the upper radiator hose.
Few days later, same type of problems.  Took it another friend. Replaced the gasket properly this time, found a tiny pin-prick hole in the upper radiator hose and fixed that.
Few days later, same problem with driving speeds. He did a read and it came up saying “Throttle Position Sensor” so after five junkyards, he found a replacement sensor.  Test drove it after he fixed it and it was fine til after a few minutes. It wouldn’t go above 20mph…even with the gas pedal to the floor.  Lights, heat, radio…everything else worked.
I also had a bit of trouble starting it when I pulled over yesterday (after him replacing the sensor). I revved the engine when I started it and it started but the check engine light came back on.  And even with the gas pedal to the floor, it just wouln’t go.
He talked to some friends and did some research.  They seem to think it’s going into “Limp Mode”.  The car has trouble accelorating past 20 and does “okay” on side streets where the speed limit is lower…but has a hell of a time getting up to 25mph.
My next move is to take it to a local shop to see whats wrong with it.  (one he trusts that won’t rip me off). All the research I’ve done hasn’t really given an answer. I’m not sure if it’s something that “could be anything” or if I really need to take it to the Dealership…I think a local shop is going to be your best bet.
When it won’t go past 20 or 40 or whatever mph, what is the engine doing?  What you actually describe can be read in at least 3 different ways.  One is that you’re hitting the gas, but the engine itself has no power.  It might run roughly. The rpms won’t get very high.  It might sound like its bogging down or something.  In this case you’re looking at a large number of different possibilities from old spark plugs, to low fuel pressure, to a clogged exhaust, to a blown head gasket.
Another read of it would be that you hit the gas and the engine revs up really high, but the car doesn’t keep speeding up because it is stuck in one gear and won’t shift.  It will peg out at a relatively high rpm but won’t go beyond it.  The engine will seem to be “screaming.”  This would possibly be a limp mode thing, where the computer has seen a transmission problem so it won’t allow the transmission to shift.  In this kind of case the rpms would go up and down steadily as you hit or release the gas pedal and every time you give the car gas you’d feel the power making it to the wheels.
Yet another read of it would be that you hit the gas, and the engine revs up really high for a bit, but than seems to “catch” and you motor along until it shifts at which point the engine revs up really high again…And each time the engine revs you don’t feel any power making it to the wheels, until maybe it “catches”.  It also might not catch at all.  This would be a slipping transmission.
Speaking of which, has anyone checked the transmission fluid?When I press the gas pedal down, the engine will rev up to 3-4000 rpms but not go any faster.
Once I get going up to about 20mph it seems to be “better” but still won’t go any faster.
When I pull over and park, the engine revs on it’s own (not touching the pedal or anything) to almost 2000rpms.
Also, I noticed yesterday (when this all happened) that when I press on the brake, it makes a thud-thud-thud noise, but the brake does work and stops the car.
I do not know if my friend checked the Transmission fluid yet. I can’t assume he has. But I will ask him.This sounds more like an engine problem than a transmission problem. By all means, check the transmission fluid for level, color and smell (it should be red, and should not smell burnt).
Is that check engine light still on? Head to your local parts place (AutoZone, O’reillys, etc), and ask them to read the computer. They’ll either give you a printout with the code and possible causes on it, or tell you a story about what could be wrong. It doesn’t really matter, just get the actual code (like P0***), and post it back here.
The engine shouldn’t jump to 2000 RPM’s when the car is just sitting, and it should rev easily with no load (e.g., sitting in park), going all the way to red line, which is well past 4000 RPM’s, more in the region of 7-8 or more.
I’m also concerned that the radiator was “bone dry”. The engine may have suffered overheating, but with no coolant to move the needle on your dash, you wouldn’t even know. Has it ever overheated that you know of? If it has, you may have a more serious engine problem to look into.
Post the code, answer those questions, and we’ll go from there.Somebody with a good scanner, preferably one that reads live data needs to check this.  The throttle position sensor needs to be monitored.  Normally, a bad sensor won’t cause limp mode in the transmission.
transmanok this is drive by wire if im right so yes something that simple can cause limp home mode because throttle vavle is electric instead of an actual cableDid youi ever find the cause for this problem?

The gear box fault light came on. It was not able to exceed 15 mph and then it would cut out.

Since they already have tried to fix this problem, do you know whether they have checked your fuel pressure?

Thanks for the reply. This model actually doesnt have an IAC valve. I checked the throttle body which didnt appear to be to dirty and checked the MAF sensor which also looked clean.
I don’t think they checked the fuel pressure.Does it do this stalling for them or is it intermittent?It’s intermittent. Whey they changed the erg valve it seemed to go away. The the issue started  again so i took it back to have the spark plugs, pcv valve and fuel filter replaced (which all had to be done regardless). Again, it seemed to stop doing it for a few days.

Here’s what it looks like http://www.partsgeek.com/catalog/2005/ford/explorer/air_intake/idle_air_control_valve.html 540
Start the engine, open the hood and with the handle of a screwdriver rap on the IAC valve. If doing this causes the idle speed to change replace the IAC valve.
TesterIf it ends up being the IAC, you can often just clean them with carb or throttle cleaner, like I mentioned above.
Cleaning it doesn’t cost much, is usually easy to do yourself and will only make it better.Hmm ok thanks for the info. I did read somewhere that this model didnt have an IAC valve. i can’t seem to find it anywhere. Any idea where it is located? I have searched online but couldn’t find anything that helped.The IAC valve is mounted on the throttle body.

512,Wheel bearing or tire noise?,Maintenance/Repairs,10,348,"Hello all,
I drive a 2010 Toyota Corolla.
So I got my two front wheel bearing replaced, by my father and I, a couple months ago, as well as my right tie rod. My rear tires were originally on the front when the bearings were going bad. I recently got two new tires because the ones that were on the front following the fix were terribly balled. So I had the new tires put on the rear and then the old tires (the ones that were on the front prior to replacing the wheel bearings) put on the front to preserve lateral stability, I also got an alignment. Following getting the two new tires, I have noticed a lot of noise when driving, it starts around 15-20 mph and just gets faster the higher my mph. Turning doesn’t really affect it, except it gets slightly quieter when turning to the right. The noise reminds me of a bad wheel bearing noise, slight whooping, but I can’t be positive plus they were just replaced. Is it my bearings going bad again or just tire noise? Any opinions would be appreciated, thanks all!Ask the alignment people whether they checked the wheel bearings.Did you actually torque the axle nuts to spec?
Or hand tighten them, or run them tight with an impact gun?
TesterWe used an impact gun. Hopefully that’s not bad haha.While it may appear to be easier to use an impact wrench, it is not recommended. OEM and bearing manufacturers always recommend using a torque wrench for installation. During removal, an impact wrench can damage the axle nut threads and shock the CV joints. It can also create a false sense of security when adjusting a nut or bolt, which may be under- or over-torqued. This can leave a hub assembly susceptible to failure. Also, in almost all cases, you should use a new axle nut.
Tester


 Dalton-17:

My rear tires were originally on the front when the bearings were going bad.


Now those noisy tires are in the front again.  I think you should have inspected the tires for a wear pattern causing the noise, you may not have needed new wheel bearings.We did use a new axel nut and the cv axel was replaced a month before the bearings, also by us. Thanks for the info! I appreciate it.The bearings were actually bad unfortunately, the sound continued after rotating the tires, and one had play in it and the other was purple from friction. I’m thinking it might be wear for the bearing going bad on the tires. Wishing I just would have gotten all 4 tires. I’m not keeping the car longer than a yearHow many miles on this car? Wheel bearings should last at least 100k miles or more on these cars.Did you hit a curb or was the vehicule involved in an accident?  I own a 2012 Corolla and road noise is a problem because Toyota cheaped out on insulation.Previous generation Corolla were quieter having owned a few of them.If you used an impact gun to install the axle nut, that’s probably why the new bearings failed prematurely.There are 158,000 on the car now. The bearings were replaced around 154,000. I hit a pot hole on one side after the replacement and before the tire replacement, but there was no noise till a month later when I got the new tires",,,,
513,Battery Acid Damage,Maintenance/Repairs,2,193,"Hi there, wondering if you can help ease my anxiety or help me know if I need to do anything else… about a year and a half ago, I stupidly knocked over a car battery in my car. It was sitting on the back of the seat, seat was down, hit the brakes hard, tipped it over, then when I moved it I put it on the seat, and took it back to the store, stupid stupid. It was in a plastic bag, but… long story short, acid got on the seat of my car, seems like maybe it went through the back of the seat, and it ate through the seat. I got it all repaired at the dealer… but they did not change out the seat belt buckle, so that is still damaged and I just don’t know if I trust that they got everything and cleaned it all out. I had put some baking soda on the new seat and on the seat belt buckle, I don’t think I put baking soda on it at the time when it was burnt up, I just tried not to drive my car much but had to wait like 2-3 weeks until I could turn it in to be repaired, I just didn’t know what I was doing, ugh I wish it never happened… I am just worried -  is there still acid in my car, could I be breathing it in , etc. I want to get it detailed and cleaned, but don’t want to spend the money. I looked under the seat and there is some rusty looking areas, and I can see the baking soda I had put down there I believe. Can’t upload the photos for some reason.We all have had accidents. Tipped over the battery in my boat, and it spewed acid everywhere. Hands pants shirt boat floor etc. I used baking soda on my hands and everywhere,  my clothes were fine and no issues for anything, 15 years later the boat floor is fine, I had sunglasses on, but I loose them faster than doans has pills. I am not saying anything except that it did not turn into the disaster I was expecting.It’s almost certain there isn’t any acid in your car anymore. If it were still there in a concentration that could harm you, you’d have already experienced symptoms. As to the seat belt buckle, it’s probably fine. The plastic shroud on the outside is just cosmetic. The important stuff is inside and it’s made mostly of metal. If you’re really worried, just find the same kind of car that you drive in a junk yard and get the seat belt buckle from it.",,,,

I have a 1986 Toyota Celica Supra with a 2.8L 5mge engine. The car literally sat in a barn for many years. I got it started after dropping the tank, having it cleaned, and installing a new fuel pump. Only other items installed were plugs, wires, cap, and rotor. The car runs, and generally well. However, it does have an intermittent miss. It is noticeable once the engine warms up. For the most part, it goes away, at about 2000+ rpm. I have a Hantek 1008c scope but cannot use it well. I have attached two pictures of the spark pattern I have captured. It is ugly.

Could there be another reason besides needing a new hybrid battery?,Maintenance/Repairs,7,262,"My 2005 Honda Civic Hybrid all of a sudden had the air conditioning stop, then the speedometer stopped and then the steering wheel was losing power.  So I pulled over the side of the road.  I was traveling from Lady Lake, FL to Palm Harbor, FL when this happened.  Got it towed to HOnda dealer in Palm Harbor.  They are telling me I need a new hybrid battery.  I told them that my Honda dealer from IL told me, about 8 years ago that I could still drive my car without getting a new one.

Honda Civic Hybrid






Also, there’s a Greentec Auto, a company that sells replacement hybrid batteries, in Clearwater, just south of you.  They list a replacement for your car at $1300-$1600, and they have mobile installation available.  But I’d want to first make sure that’s the problem.Here’s an article on them:
http://www.lukmangaru.com/hybrid-honda-civic-hybrid-battery-problems/ 1I’ve been in similar situations, though not with a hybrid battery.
If you really need to get back on the road, here’s what I’d suggest:

See what they’ll give you on trade-in for a new car on their lot. Compare the value of your car, as is, vs the price of a new hybrid battery, vs just getting a new (or new to you) car. This is by far the most expensive option, but it would solve all your problems today.
Rent a car, or find some other way to get home, and leave the Honda with the dealer for the time being. Assuming they are OK with this, that gives you time to reflect on your next steps, and also it’ll get you home.

Good luck.

This statement bothers me a lot. I hope you misunderstood the dealer.  The 12 volt battery is not even the right question.  The question is…why won’t the car run on the ENGINE alone?  Get that answer out of the shop.

When the computer detects a defect in the high voltage battery it will discontinue hybrid operation. When the high voltage battery fails completely the high voltage accessories will not operate; air conditioning compressor and power steering.
If the engine still operates, I would complete the trip then repair or replace the car.Rockauto shows a hydraulic power steering pump and a pully-driven a/c compressor for the 2005 Civic hybrid, and the engine photos I could find look like they’re driven off the crankshaft like a non-hybrid.

In my State, the seller signs the title, not the buyer. The buyer can fill out the rest later.
I never trust someone who wants to buy a car sight unseen.  Plus, I only take cash.  Even something as robust as PayPal can still respond to a complaint. And, be sure to designate this as an “as-is” sale, and keep a copy  signed by the buyer.I would exercise the normal amount of caution.
Sorry to say this but until you actually receive the “Cash in hand, In good payment” you can’t be sure.
Credit card payment can be reversed especially in the case of Identity Fraud, I print my own check which may or may not be for me and counterfeit Bank drafts  aren’t uncommon but once the funds actually appear in your account you have a reasonable expectation that the “funds are good”…
Unfortunately purchasing a car without “good funds” by a remote buyer, leaving the Seller and the Towing Company twisting in the wind isn’t uncommon.
Your best defense is to know the buyer (personal ID, etc.) before releasing the car and/or to wait until your bank confirms that the amount is deposited “in good funds” into your account.
At a maximum it takes a week to confirm  and it beats the heck out of trying to chase down a car that’s already gone to Albania or a chop shop in NJ.Beancounter nailed it See the linked article for ways people can be fraudulently separated from their money…
https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-craigslist-car-scam-4772696 25Yep, definitely a scam.
I’ve sold 3 cars on Craigslist in the last couple of years. In my experience, 90% of the interactions were with scammers. It’s very frustrating.Scam likely in the 99th percentile. The way I look at it is that if someone has the funds and the are going to  pick the car up then simply bring cash and save any aggravation over cashier checks or card payment reversals.@gandhi_s-flip-flop    You did not say what this vehicle is . If a late model a place like Carmax will buy it and you can leave with a check that is good and no worries . If older insist on cash and have one of those counterfeit pens handy .
Also why do you have your profile hidden ?I like your car. I will send money. = scam.And they’ve gotten more clever about it, too. First they ask you a bunch of questions about it, and when you take the time and trouble to reply to all of them, then they pull the “I’ll send a cashier’s check” crap.
OP, one guaranteed flag that it’s a scam before they even reveal the scam is when they ask you to reply to an email address rather than through the Craigslist email system. That’s because they’re trying to avoid leaving evidence of their scam on CL because CL will ban them.Yeah and they asked me vehicle’s condition and what owner I am on 96 model car  where I already said everything about the condition on the post. First I thought they were being stupid but obviously they don’t read the post just try to scam by replying.

While it has all of the earmarks of a scam, asking stupid questions is not necessarily an indication of it being a scam.  I say that because, back in “the good old days”, prior to Craig’s List and other electronic media, I tried to sell a couple of my old cars via the only method available in those days, namely newspaper ads.
My ads always included ALL of the pertinent info, including make, model, model year, exterior color, interior color, size/type of engine, type of transmission, and odometer mileage.  Here are some typical phone calls:
Caller #1:  What color is it?
Me: It’s silver, just like it says in the ad
#1: Oh, I wanted a red car… click
Caller #2:  Is it a V-8?
Me: No, as the ad states, it’s a six-cylinder
#2: A six?  I would NEVER buy a six!  … click
Caller #3:  How old is the car?
Me: As the ad indicates, it is 7 years old
#3:   My father said I shouldn’t buy anything more than 5 years old. … click
Caller #4:  Does it have an automatic transmission?
Me:  No, just as the ad states, it is a 4-speed manual transmission
#4: (obviously indignant) How do you expect ME to drive a manual transmission?
At that point, I hung up, and resolved to never again try to sell my old cars to bizarre a-holes who either don’t read or are unable to comprehend what they read.  In both cases, I wound-up selling the cars to co-workers for a fairly low price, just so that I wouldn’t have to deal with any more crazy callers. And, now that I am retired, I just trade my old cars in, because I no longer have any co-workers.
So… you shouldn’t  use the factor of “stupid questions” as the only criterion for deciding whether something is a scam.Back when I used to sell mostly antique motorcycle parts and a few car parts on eBay I ran into some of the same type of questions.
My ads were always as clear and as concise as possible.
Example. Gas tank cat eye dash. Fits all Harley EL/FL knuckleheads, U/UL/ULH flatheads, WL/G/WLA 45 flatheads from 1939 to 1946.(In a nutshell, it fits everything in that era production line.)
Questions from potential bidders.
Will it fit a 74 inch knucklehead? Yes, that’s what the FL stands for; 74 cubic inches. EL for 61 C.I.
Will it fit a U sidevalve? Yes, that’s what the U represents.Flathead or sidevalve; 6 of one/half dozen…
Will it fit a military 45? Yes, military 45s are WLAs.
Will it fit a ULH which has a different cylinder bore? Yes. Cylinder bore is irrelevant. Chassis is same.
What color is it? See pic in ad. Scruffy paint; needs refinished. It is 60 years old and saw military service in WWII.
Lord…It could be; I only sell by meeting at a bank and have the cash deposited to my account or have a cashiers check checked by the bank to see if it is good.  there have been a lot of cashiers check frauds lately where it bounces back as unpayable after the “buyer” is gone with the car.  Best to only take cash.  A genuine buyer won’t mind and it sorts the fraud to a much smaller percentage.What you described is EXACTLY what happened when we bought a used car for my mom several years ago
We met the seller in the parking lot of a mall, on a sunny day.  He made sure to park right in the middle, so that there were plenty of other cars . . . and presumably other people . . . around, so that there would be witnesses in case we were up to no good
I checked out the car . . . I’ll spare you the details . . . and we went on a test drive. Everything was fine, so we decided to buy the car
We all drove the the seller’s bank and conducted business inside.  My mom wrote a certified or cashier’s check . . . or whatever you want to call them . . . and the seller’s bank made sure everything was legitimate and that it would go through
The seller said he’d been scammed before and was taking absolutely no chances this time.



 Ralph-66:

A genuine buyer won’t mind and it sorts the fraud to a much smaller percentage.


Yeah, we didn’t mind at all.  The trip to the bank didn’t add that much time.I buy and sell old motorcycles and scooters on Craigslist a couple of times a year.   I’ve learned to be clear in the sell ads:
It’s available.  If I sell it I’ll delete the ad.
I want cash only.  Good old folding green US currency.  Period.
I won’t bargain until you look at it and talk to me in person.  Period.
It is what it is, an older, running machine in pretty good shape. Period.
When I get stupid emails I answer with one or two words.  Is it available?  Yes. Will you take 30% less? No.  Will you take a certified check? No.  I’m 1000 miles away, will you hold it for a week?  No.Cash only. Cash only. Cash only – Repeat after me over and over. There is a scam a minute out there. Take the cash to the bank for a counterfeit check before you sign the title. It’s the world we now live in.I have actually insisted on being paid in 20’s instead of 100’s, in situations where things just smelled funny.  And, living in coastal California, it’s generally a good idea to keep a stash of cash somewhere outside the house so you will be able to get to it after a big earthquake, so being paid in 20’s helps get enough of them together.As most have noted, Craig’s list is lousy with scammers. I’ve sold some equipment there in the past few years and typically what happens is this.
The first responders express lots in interest and send a cashier’s check. the problem is, the casier’s check is

for much more than you asked for, so you’re expected to send the difference along with the item for sale
Counterfeit.
They rely on the fact that most people will be greedy enough to think they’re going to get more than they asked for and ship the merchandise and that they can’t tell the difference between a genuine cashier’s check and a fake one.
If you’re selling on Ebay another common ploy is to send you what looks like an email from PayPal confirming receipt of funds and demanding that you ship the product. Only by checking your PayPal account will you actually know that the funds haven’t actually been sent. Very slick.
Don’t fall for these, Unfortunately these sites are rife with faudsters.
Thank you for sort of clarifying between funds appearing in your account, and banks confirming “funds are good.”  If you have a clean record of not trying to kite checks, a bank or CU might allow you instant access to a deposited check.  HOWEVER, if they find out it’s bad later on, they will reverse the transaction, and you will be stuck holding the bag.  So it’s best to wait for the check to clear, which might take 2-5 days, depending on banking systems, before releasing the vehicle.And note that cashiers checks are not a certainty. People think if they demand a cashier’s check rather than a personal check, they’ll be safe because the money has already been withdrawn. But they can be faked, and they often are in Craigslist scams.
When I finally sell a car it’s not worth much, so I demand cash only. Even that’s not completely safe because counterfeiting does exist. I’m not exactly a numismatics expert, especially these days when I hardly ever touch cash, so the counterfeit bill would probably have to be very fake for me to know it. But it’s safer than checks.",,,,
517,How to fix this CD/DVD error on Honda Odyssey - “Bad Disc - See Owner’s Manual”,Maintenance/Repairs,15,26.4k,"Hello, just wondering if anyone can help with my 2014 Honda Odyssey. The DVD player works for a little while, but then will get interrupted by the car - I think the CD player - and will shut off. An error message then appears: “Bad Disc - See Owner’s Manual”. The manual just refers me to a dealer. I don’t think I have a disc stuck. I’ve read that I should take out the fuse for a day and put it back in, but I can’t figure out which fuse is for the CD/DVD player(s). Thanks for your help!Is this car still covered by warranty?
Are you using a burnt disc . . . in other words one that you copied yourself?Not really clear whether it is a DVD or CD here, but does it do it with all discs or some. Some players are picky and would reject some discs, esp the ones you burn yourself.
The fuse should be in your owner’s manual.
Also, if under warranty, then take it to the dealer. Not much can be done to repair these units nowadays.
I see @db4690 beat me I would not imagine it is anything to do with a fuse, I would rather think it is about your disks or maybe some dirt on the drive lens
if you “burn your own disks”: consider using another brand of the blanks, for example Memorex tends to have lower quality than Verbatim, another thing to try is to buy dedicated “musical blanks”, they definitely work better in picky drives
I would not imagine dirt to be the factor in relatively new 2014 drive, but after years in service I would disassemble the drive and CAREFULLY blow lens with air and make sure grease is not old/thicken on the slidesThanks, I believe we are out of warranty though I’ll double-check. I don’t think it is a disc issue, as the player seems to be churning/making noises whether I’m trying to play a DVD or not. The CD player area seems to have the green light on all the time.
And I did look for the fuse in my owner’s manual but couldn’t find it. I have the fuse location map, but maybe I don’t know enough about the abbreviations? None of them said CD or DVD.Sometimes they have a reset button, it is a tiny dot and you have to push it in with the tip of a paperclips.If the DVD player is making noises with no disc then there’s a problem with it. I might try gently blowing it out with some canned ‘air’.  If it gets no power when the key is off I wouldn’t worry about the fuse.I’ve fixed that “bad disc”  problem on home dvd players by taking them apart and cleaning the lens with a q-tip and alcohol, and lubing the two slides with a tiny dab of white lithium grease.  My experience with this procedure is it usually works, but only for about 6 weeks, then the same problem re-occurs.  The ultimate cause seems to be the two drive motors themselves just wear out with use & get a little balky.  One drive motor  spins the disk, and the other moves the laser head in and out to follow the tracks.  Those seem to be just simple dc motors, and  the commutator probably starts to fail with high resistance, segment by segment.  Causes the dvd player computer to get confused about where the laser is pointed,  because it commands the motor to move, but it doesn’t move smoothly like it should.  That’s probably what causes all the noise, it is trying desperately to figure out where the laser is pointing, moving things here and there.    It’s sort of surprising, but from what I could figure out by inspecting the mechanism,  the only way the dvd computer knows where the laser is pointing is by examining the signal returns it gets from the disc itself; that seems to be the way they are designed, so they can be priced so low.   You get one heck of a lot of sophisticated optical  technology for $35 these days.
One caution, never take it upon yourself to take apart dvd or cd players or dvd/cd burners or anything containing a laser unless you understand the necessary safety precautions for working with lasers, as eye damage is possible from the bright lasers these products use.

I’ve been making this “fix” repeatedly with many devices, George, and my wife was joking about one that I better did not do it as it worked something like 5 years after slides lubrication  I used synthetic caliper grease, not lithium Does anyone smoke in this vehicle?  I repair computers and see this issue quite often with computers owned by smokers.  Sometimes a good cleaning of the laser lens is all it takes.  Other times it is history.  One issue is that the dirt on the lens can cause the laser to operate at a higher power and it burns itself out even after you clean the lens.
Some of these drives are keyed into the equipment they are installed within so be aware of this if working on it yourself.  For example, on gaming consoles such as the PlayStation and XbOX the controller on the drive is keyed to the motherboard of the unit.  You can’t just find an identical part and install it.  You must either reflash the new controller or re-use the old one if it isn’t failed.
I have seen drives fail with no apparent reason but usually dirt plays a major role in this.  Gaming consoles are usually completely full of filth including dead and living bugs, cigarette smoke, pet hair, and more.  I have seen some cars like this as well…


 andriy.fomenko:

I used synthetic caliper grease, not lithiu


Maybe I’m using the wrong grease. On this new replacement dvd player I just bought, I’m gonna lube those damn slides every three months.  Proactively.   I’ll try the type of grease you recommend.   I use the dvd player a lot, but even so I think they should last longer than the prior one did, about 3 years.
Here’s something else about failing dvd players of interest:  Sometimes the dvd part can’t be made to work, but it will still play audio cd’s ok.  That comes in handy for me b/c the Sony dvd player version I use plays cd’s not only in the normal cd format, but alsow encoded in mp3 format.  I can pop in  a CD and have 30-40 hours of Car Talk  queued up  & ready to play.Hello!  Did you ever find a fix for this?  My 2012 Odyssey just started doing this last week after ejecting a CD.  The CD Player light stays green all the time and continually tries to load/unload CDs.  It eventually gives a Bad Disc - See Owner’s Manual error.  I tried resetting the fuse and disconnecting the battery.
I may try disassembling it this weekend and see if something is inside of it.
Thanks!In my case, my child had stuck a penny into the CD slot! So the DVD player accepted discs, and would play them for a while, before being interrupted by the CD error message. The penny was easily popped out by a mechanic. I hope your solution is as simple/silly!

Bad Disc - See Owner’s Manual error


Hello, I’m wondering if there was a resolution for the “Bad Disc - See Owner’s Manual” error.
My 2015 Pilot started doing this a week ago. My wife tried putting a CD in and it was ejected right away. Now every time we open a door or start/shut off the car, the CD player makes noise like it’s loading or reading a CD. I pulled the Fuse and it didn’t fix it.
I wonder if there’s a way we could disconnect the CD player as we can probably live with out it.hi. Any luck in fixing it?any success?",,,,

519,1992 Ford Thunderbird pulls left when braking,Maintenance/Repairs,12,479,"Car pulls left when braking.  Replaced all front end parts including struts.The brakes on that side are taking hold more than on the other. If you had the brakes done recently take it back to the shop that did the work. If not, have the brakes looked at.Remember, it is just as likely to be caused by the right side brake not working as it is the left side grabbing. The back brakes can cause this too.Does “all front end parts” include ball joints?  If not, that is a possibility.
Since all front end parts including struts were replaced has the car been on the alignment rack? If not, it should have been.
The car is 28 years old and that brings up the possibility of original calipers and whether or not the right side caliper piston is sticking or the caliper is sticking on the sliders.Thank you all.  Yes, the car has been aligned by two different shops.  I replaced the calipers because of this issue and it didn’t change.  Rear brakes are OK.  I also replaced the front hoses and the master cylinder.  Ball joints are tight.  I suspect the strut bushings but the “rubber” is new.  I had an older mechanic who worked on these cars look at them.  He suggested an alignment.  How many alignments do I need? 


 pete38:

How many alignments do I need?


One more should do it.  Seriously, I’m not a mechanic but it doesn’t sound like another alignment will solve your problem unless the guys who did the last two are utterly incompetent. Unless some part is damaged I’d go back to a problem with the brakes. As @oldtimer_11 said, the left brake or even the front brakes aren’t necessarily the source of the trouble.If you can do it safely, try braking with the parking brake while underway. That puts only the rear brakes - or one of them - in play.The rear parking brake is cable actuated so if the rear brake is having a problem with a sticking caliper or hose, it won’t show up using the parking brake.I pinched off the hoses for the front brakes so that only the rear brakes were active.  They worked fine.  No pulling.Great detective work. You’ve isolated the problem to the front of the car and my money’s still on the brakes.The problem started as pulling left when hitting the  brakes.  The first thing I did was the front calipers and rotors.  There was no change.  So I’m up against the odds of getting a new caliper failing the exact same way on the same side.  Maybe I’ll swap the calipers and see if the problem follows to the right side.Problem solved.  I figured I should close this loop.  It was a bad ball joint.  Car tracks nice and straight now.  I had brought it to 3 shops and all said that the ball joints were fine.  It recently developed a “squeak/groan” when turning.  I thought ball joint so replaced all 4.  That was it!
Thank you all for your help.

Damage is to an extent you clearly see there was a collision and there is a big dent but only damage was done to the plastic cover.
I googled it but there is just so many different answers that is not narrowing down anything like “oh your estimate is between 200 and 2000 dollars” like what the hell, lol.Well , you did not say what this vehicle is and your profile is hidden so I could not look at your other threads for a clue.  I would just walk away from a damaged vehicle because that tells me that might be other things that you did not fix.Ask your asking price and say if you want this fixed it will be this estimate from repair shop additional, or you can take it as is and have it repaired on your own dime. It can get messy, I would go for as is.This is a 15 year old car.  A very rough search shows a selling price of $500 to $2,500.  The repair is going to cost you way more that you will get back on the selling price.  Just sell it as is and hope for the bestFor an 05 Malibu, I wouldn’t bother spending $500 on the bumper. The buyer of this car just needs cheap transportation. Would care about the mechanicals and would be happy to get a discount for a damaged bumper.Them said it was an '05 Malibu.  I think it depends on the buyer and whether they want a pristine car and are willing to pay, or they want a good price and can live with the damage.  I can’t imagine spending that kind of money though just to sell it private.  If it were mine, I’d just fix it myself for $50, but forget paying someone to do it, IMHO anyway.Just buying a sprayer is almost $50 + primer,paint and clear coat it probably will be $150 atleast when I checked, it was around that price. But would be happy to know where you buy that cheap paint. My bumper has a lot of cracks so that is why it is kind of expensive. $250 paint and $150 bumper + possible taxes.Another vote for “save your money and sell it as-is”.  You will pay way more to fix this than the difference in value between selling it as-is, or selling it with this minor cosmetic damage repaired.  This is a $1500 to $2500 car depending on mileage and overall condition.  It is not new enough, nor valuable enough to justify spending money for bodywork prior to selling it.Not counting the $90 or so for a aftermarket rear bumper that you still have to paint, salvage yards want more than that for a bumper cover in decent shape.People are going to knock your price with visible flaws, it is part of negotiating. You may have set your price based on the condition of the vehicle, it is unreasonable to discount a low value 16 year old vehicle $500 because of cosmetic damage to the rear bumper cover. Someone who understands that you can’t see the rear bumper while driving might pay more.



 gandhi_s-flip-flop:

Just buying a sprayer is almost $50 + primer,paint and clear coat it probably will be $150 at least when I checked, it was around that price. But would be happy to know where you buy that cheap paint.


Perhaps a time machine and go back 25 years. If you have a lot of time on your hands you might search the self serve salvage yards for a bumper of the same color in better condition, probably not worth the effort.Well I have all that stuff except the color coat which is why I said if it was me, I’d fix it myself.  You aren’t me and don’t even have a sprayer so forget fixing it.  Guess I was unclear.$40.99 for a bumper cover at Pick N Pull here. Their website has an inventory search so you can see if nearby yards have one or not. And if it’s the same color.There are two pick-a-part yards here, they have pictures of the front of the vehicles online, the condition of the rear is a mystery. I can walk through 15 cars of my make and model and not find the part I need.We have one here and the next closest is in Tacoma so a bigger selection.

522,Recommend me my first car please,General Discussion,17,672,"I’m in highschool and I’m looking for a good starter car. I’m looking for a cheap car that is fun and fast to ride around in but it can’t be a coupe because i have a big family that likes to visit a lot and I’ve found a car 2016 chevrolet cruze limited 1lt auto, so i would also like your thoughts on that and recommendations also my budget is 8kAround where I live, the 2016 Cruze cost anywhere from $11,500 to $16,000
I’d be wary of one for $8,000, it may be a fair price in your area, but not around here.Possible for an ex-rental where you’d be owner #4 on one example, could be a decent car but it
would not be my first choice. Mazda 3 would be worth thinking about even if you have to go a little older.This is a near impossible question to answer. What may be a neat car to one person may be a disaster to you.
It’s also a used car and those are not created equal. One may be fine mechanically; another similar one may be having a love affair with a car crusher. No matter the car, a pre-purchase inspection is a must and even that is not an iron clad guarantee of a problem free car.
I have a hard time thinking of a 1 L Cruze as fun and fast. One bit of advice I can offer is this.
Be PATIENT. Do your footwork and do not get in a hurry. There are some good cars out there with a very good prices but it takes time to sort them out. Do NOT go falling for scams on Craigslist,
Facebook, Offerup, and so on for cars with prices that seem too good to be true.
You have the money so remain calm/patient.
Recently there was very clean looking 2007 Nissan Sentra on FB. Low miles, nothing wrong, runs/drives great, and only 675 dollars with free shipping and money back guarantee.  You would be surprised at how many people fall for things like this.Every one is going to have different ideas of “cheap” and “fun”.  When I was first old enough to drive, I had a 1988 Toyota Corolla, which I shared with my sister.  It was beat-up and rusty, but it never let us down.  Everyone I knew at the time had something similar–old and beat-up.  I thought the 1988 Corolla was fun and fast, although it’s possible that if I was to drive one today it would be less satisfying.
While I’m not going to tell you to buy a 32 year old economy car, I am going to tell you that a 4-year old car is too new, and $8k is too much for a teenager’s first car.  I would recommend something like a 1996-2008 Toyota Corolla/Chevrolet Prizm, 1997-2006 Toyota Camry (avoid the 4-cylinder for 2002 to 2006 models), 1997-2005 Honda Civic, 1997-2005 Honda Accord (4-cylinder only), 1999-2005 Dodge Neon, etc.  You should be able to buy a decent running car for less than $3k with less than 150,000 miles.

Additionally, different people have different definitions of “decent”.
Many years ago, I knew a guy who bought what he considered to be “decent” used cars that usually had starting problems a few times each week, and broke-down often.   Like all of his other friends, I learned that I couldn’t rely on his timely arrival because his cars were so unreliable.

That’s hilariousYou are in high school? 16yrs old? And have to provide rides for family when they visit? Are you a taxi service? Why can’t your parents provide a ride for “family” when they visit? Sounds like an odd situation. How is visiting family arriving? Bus? Plane?
Dang, I did not have $8000 in cash when I was in high school, more like $8.Wherever all of the people who think less than $3k is unrealistic live, I’m glad I don’t live there!  That must be a part of the country where cars crumble into rust after 10-15 winters.  In the south and west, rust is not a problem, so cars last a lot longer, and prices are much more reasonable.
Here, I can buy a good quality used car from the late 1990s to mid 2000s for less than $3k all day long–with no rust, body damage, or mechanical problems.  In fact, people trying to sell these cars for more than $2500 or so, see them languish on the market for weeks or even months.

Higher cost of living too. I don’t live in the major lake effect areas of PA, but we do use a good amount of salt and brine down here, so while rust is a factor, it’s not endgame like it can be in the true rust belt areas.
That being said, you’re looking at cars that are between 15-23ish years old. There may be no visible body damage, but you still have cars that have been in service for that long (and in the Southwest, higher levels of ozone deteriorating rubber parts), and will likely start to need more routine repairs. My father-in-law’s last cheap car purchase was a 2000 or 01 Passat. Body was in great shape, no accidents. The turbo was fine. Only problem was the heater core was bypassed due to it leaking. We pulled the dash twice to replace the heater core. One of the times it went, one of the hoses ruptured causing a massive coolant loss (nothing like the smell of coolant smoking pouring in the passenger area…). After that we had nothing but nagging electrical problems and random misfires. He thankfully finally traded it in for a used Prius. I’m not going to miss that damn thing.

I’m looking for a cheap car that is fun and fast to ride around in but it can’t be a coupe because i have a big family


For $8k. I’d consider the 2010-2012 Ford Fusion V6 or Sport (rare). The Sport will have the 3.5L V6, which is plenty powerful for a car of it’s size.  The 2007-2012 Mazda 6 V6 ,  2009-2010 Subaru Legacy with the Turbo H4 or N/A H6 (might not be able to find one at that price point). I’d also consider the 2009-2010 Corolla XRS or 2007-2010 Honda Civic Si sedan, if you want something smaller.
Alternatively, you can get a 2 door car and tell your large family to drive themselves around.Friend went to boarding school in high school era. Never had visitors. Like Scrooge.Forget “fast and fun.” That’s for middle aged dudes who can afford it. You want reliable. As a generality, that means a Corolla or Civic, maybe a Camry if you need the room. If you need something even bigger, maybe an Impala. Let’s keep it under 100k on the odometer on principle. The national average is 13.5k/year so look for something 7 years old or newer. An older car with very low miles has either spent a lot of time sitting or it’s been driven on very short trips, which isn’t good for it. Get a Carfax if at all possible. Budget enough to have the car inspected by a reputable mechanic and set something aside for repairs because you’ll need it.ahhh yes - my 4 on the floor Carola 2 door  ( in the 1975 era ) - was fun but couldnt get up a mountain for beans …First off buy from a reputable dealer where you can get a 30-day (or more) 100% warranty. You will pay more but you’ll get your money’s worth. You do not have enough experience to purchase a vehicle from a private party (half of whom are getting rid of a problem). Nothing like learning a good life’s lesson than putting hard earned money out for a vehicle and then have to park it 2 weeks later because you can’t afford the repair. Again, buy from a dealer.Thornback , bcohen is not the one looking for advice and I can’t see him spending 8000.00 on a vehicle anyway.Don’t forget, if you don’t drive too fast or get a muscle car, your insurance will be about $1200.

My car’s coolant gets dirty with what seems to be an oily substance, even if I do a coolant exchange it gets dirty again. The funny part is that both my engine & trans dipsticks show no signs of coolant whatsoever, neither in color nor in smell.
The only leak I’ve spotted though is from the power steering assembly. Any ideas on what might be causing this problem? Thank you very much!There may be a very small leak in the transmission fluid cooler inside the radiator.
The transmission fluid pressure can get high at certain RPM’s

Where as, the cooling system pressure is lower than what the pressure cap reads.
So, I think the tranny cooler in the radiator has a leak.

524,What constitutes as a truck chassis?,General Discussion,28,815,"We bought out the lease on our 2017 Rav4. The title I received today lists the chassis as truck. I called the DMV to check and was told the categories are determined by vin number. I cannot find any info why.@Barkydog.  You may be forced to join the teamsters since you elected to keep the RAV 4.
This classification may allow you to license your minivan as a truck.  I have always licensed.mu minivans as trucks.  This allows me to park in truck loading zones.  I know back in the 1950s here in Indiana that station wagons.could be licensed as trucks.I am not really sure how truck licensing in WI works. There are a and b truck license plates but my f100 dd not have a truck plate designation. I get a regular automobile plate for the Rav4, and I believe it was the same for the f100.The RAV4 is not a truck because its has a unibody construction.A truck has a chassis or frame like most pickups and larger vehicules.In Canada,the RAV4 is in the regular passenger car categorie in terms of licensing.I don’t know about the U.S though.Every state has its own definition.
My “truck” Avalanche was licensed as a car in Ohio because they considered it an SUV and therefore a car.  The vehicle is a truck in the eyes of the United States. In Florida, it is licensed as a truck and costs me more than my cars.
As far as the chassis goes… it is based on the Camry and Avalon CAR chassis, not a Tacoma or a Tundra truck chassis.
Since it is built overseas, I’d guess it is not a truck by the federal definition or it would pay the 25% Chicken Tax.


 COROLLAGUY1:

This vehicle has unibody construction, it is classified as a truck.
image912×400 133 KBThis, too, was a unibody chassis and was certainly a truck.
The only time it’s detrimental to register a truck as a car is if the fuel mileage is low enough to be classified as a gas guzzler. Any vehicle registered as a car with average EPA mileage less than 22.5 mpg gets the gas guzzler tax.  This tax does not apply to minivans, sport utility vehicles, and pick-up trucks. Congress did not impose a gas guzzler tax on these vehicle types because in 1978, at the time the law was enacted, they represented a relatively small fraction of the overall fleet of passenger vehicles and were used more for business purposes than personal transportation.


 jtsanders:

detrimental to register a truck as a car is if the fuel mileage is low enough to be classified as a gas guzzler


Just to clarify, the definition of car or truck is not the consumer’s choice. The tax is applied at the time of sale on vehicles that are defined as trucks with the federal government and collected by the IRS. States have no say nor do they collect that tax at registration.

6.1.2 Passenger Cars
Passenger cars are defined as any coupes, compacts, sedans, or station wagons with the primary
purpose of carrying passengers.28 All passenger cars (sourceTypeID 21) are categorized in the
light-duty vehicle regulatory class (regClassID 20). Cars were not surveyed in VIUS, but Polk
has a robust yet proprietary dataset of car registrations from all fifty states.
6.1.3 Light-Duty Trucks
Light-duty trucks include pickups, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), and vans.28 Depending on use
and GVWR, we categorize them into two different MOVES source types: 1) passenger trucks
(sourceTypeID 31), and 2) light commercial trucks (sourceTypeID 32). According to 2011 VM-1
vehicle classifications from FHWA, light-duty vehicles are those weighing less than 10,000
pounds, specifically vehicles with a GVWR in Class 1 and 2, except Class 2b trucks with two
axles or more and at least six tires are assigned to the single unit truck category.
VIUS contains many survey questions on weight; we chose to use both a VIN-decoded gross
vehicle weight rating (ADM_GVW) and a respondent self-reported GVWR (VIUS_GVW) to
differentiate between light-duty and single unit trucks.
For the passenger trucks, there is a final
VIUS constraint that the most frequent operator classification (OPCLASS) must be personal
transportation. Inversely, light commercial trucks (sourceTypeID 32) have a VIUS constraint
that their most frequent operator classification must not be personal transportation.It’s only on new cars.
When we bought our new Silhouette minivan in 2003, I mentioned registering it as a car to the salesman. He insisted that we register it as a truck to avoid the guzzler tax. He may have been wrong and the minivan would not have been taxed, but that’s what he said.""shadowfax,
So then… .Is this a truck, a car, or a stupid?
I vote for \\ STUPID ///.Certainly not Smart anymore.For years in NY state you could register your pickup truck as either a commercial vehicle or a passenger vehicle.  You got cheaper insurance as a commercial vehicle but you could not drive on a Parkway. Buffalo has a lot of streets designated as parkways, mostly connecting the city’s Olmstead Parks and the city police used to look for trucks with commercial plates using the Parkways.Reminds me of a ticket I got in Chicago. Trucks use 2 right lanes. Did not think they meant my 72 f100. Paid the ticket. Officer was did you not see the sign? I was like I thought that meant real trucks like 18 wheelers. There were vans as big as my truck in the left lane, oh well. Wonder if my Rav4 could get a ticket because it has a truck chassis.

GM recalls over 200,000 vehicles to fix leak that can stop travel, possibly... 20
General Motors is recalling more than 217,000 cars and SUVs to fix an issue that can cause those vehicles to lose power while moving or possibly catch fire.

527,Subaru safety switch,Maintenance/Repairs,6,229,"I have a 2014 Forester that had an apparent that appeared to have a failure of the clutch safety switch, located under the clutch arm (is that what you call it?), It was replaced, worked for two weeks, and stopped working, which you can tell because the car won’t start without frequent pumping of the clutch till it decides to “catch”. So that switch was replaced with a factory switch (first one was aftermarket and therefor suspect)-  but it does not work either. What else in the chain is suspect here?Are you adjusting the switch correctly?

TesterThe starter solenoid contacts are probably worn, cycling the ignition to the start position repeatedly will usually get the starter to operate. You can get the same results by pumping the clutch pedal.Thanks, it is something my mechanic had considered. Switch has been adjusted from here to Tuesday. First step now, jumper the switch to take it our of the running before proceeding further. Could be something else in the ignition circuit he thinks.
B2BA3CCE763242DBB0D2EF011FA9704E.png708×1 82 BytesYes, thanks, that was item #1.
B2BA3CCE763242DBB0D2EF011FA9704E.png708×1 82 BytesIt could be that the clutch itself could be causing this problem. The throwout bearing rests on a guide sleeve which rides on an aluminum snout on the transmission. That snout protrudes out over the mainshaft and with wear the snout can become damaged. That in turn allows the guide sleeve to hang up at times and can affect clutch pedal operation. Detecting this can sometimes be very difficult.
Some replacement clutches may come with a stainless steel sleeve which fits over the transmission snout and prevents this problem. In other cases the sleeve must be purchased separately. At this point and if the clutch is working fine otherwise I would be hesitant to recommend a fishing expedition involving transmission removal and clutch replacement.
I might ask how much free play is in the clutch pedal and about how far off of the floor is the clutch pedal when it starts to engage?
Below is a pic of the sleeve. (Sleeve on the right) This issue has been around forever and a day.
Thanks. The engine (short block, warranty job) and the clutch were replaced about 14k miles ago, mechanic noted how GOOD the clutch was, but you never know, probably won’t go fishing there first. Pedal itself is fine.

528,Oil plug fell out; engine shot; servicer won’t accept blame!,Maintenance/Repairs,79,7.4k,"2011 Cruze LT Turbo - well maintained - last oil change Dec 2017 at local GM dealers - only place car maintained and all oil changes there. On hwy and large warning sign and audible - stop car and engine. Out of town GM dealer says oil plug fell out - engine finished - need new one - $5-6,000+. Ouch!!
Servicing dealer refuses to accept liability! Am being told by experts over-tightened plug (stripped/cross threaded) or not tightened properly will undoubtedly be the cause - obviously servicing GM dealer issue and they should accept responsibility and do the “right thing” by repairing!
Anyone know of any other reasons why plug might fall out?  I am being told to sue but need a car now.Sorry to hear your problem.
Oil plugs fall out because they are stripped - pan or plug, usually pan.  They also fall out because they were not tightened well enough. They can also be knocked out by hitting debris, curbs, ect with the pan.
The dealer has the pan. That is your evidence. Make sure it doesn’t get away from you. Go get it from the dealer. Stripped threads may be evidence of culpability of the dealership. Contact a lawyer that specializes in this type of litigation.
Big scrapes may show it may be your insurance companies problem. If you hit something that damaged your oil pan and destroyed your engine, it should be covered. Call your insurance agent.
Your car is only worth about $5000 before the broken engine. I would not pay $5000 for a replacement engine. Go buy another car and let the insurance or lawyer argue on your behalf for the value of the car before this happened.


 John24:

Anyone know of any other reasons why plug might fall out?


Sabotage? Unfortunately, four months have passed by.  When did you last check the oil level?  How often did you check it?  How many miles since the oil change?Big question here, and a very important one too, did you heed the warning to stop the engine immediately or did you continue driving?
If you did heed the message and shut down immediately, or shortly thereafter, did you hear any unusual noises like knocking or loud clattering before the engine shut down.  If you did not, then you may NOT need a new engine.  You may only need the oil pan threads repaired and a new drain plug, fresh oil and you could be good to go.
I would wonder if the dealer who has the vehicle now actually tested the engine or just assumed it was bad.  It would be a gamble to repair the oil pan and replace the plug, fill with oil just to see if the engine is any good.  But if you shut down immediately and didn’t hear any unusual sounds, I would take that gamble because odds are the engine will start right up and run fine.But if anybody messes around with the oil pan in any way . . . even if for testing . . . the servicing dealer will definitely be off the hook, from a legal standpointThe servicing dealer either has left the plug loose or has been overtightening it which has damaged the oil pan threads and caused the plug to fall out.
As db4590 mentions, you have another dealer figured into the equation and that makes the matter much more fuzzy as the servicing dealer could say the new guy done it. A lot will depend upon the new guy dealer and what they are prepared to say and do to help you in your case.
Keep in mind these dealers all attend the same dealer meetings and get drunk together…You also have 4 months between the oil change and the plug falling out. What happened during that time.  The offending dealer will argue someone else tampered with it, otherwise it would have failed right away.  They will put you in  the tough position of proving you did not have some one else over tighten it.  You are in a tough spot, good luck.Hi Keith,  thanks for the response.
Our first notice was the warning beeper going off and a very large warning notice on the display - saying to pull over and stop the engine which is exactly what we did before calling the nearest dealer. We were 120 miles from home at that time and the dealer we called has an impeccable reputation so had no problem leaving the car there. What they did is examine the oil - very little - but enough to test and if fresh metal slivers in the oil and pan then they know the engine is gonzo - especially the crankshaft.  We have GM directly looking into it all - just that they can be notoriously slow at times. Will keep everyone updated … and if anyone has a real problem with GM, there is a way to get their attention.Hi Steve - luckily for us, the car has only been serviced by the same GM dealer since new - only one in the area - including oil changes, recalls etc. and we change oil exactly when the car’s computer tells us to do so. What we are hearing from qualified mechanics is that a less-than-tightened or stripped plug could take a while to work it;s way out. We were highway driving at around 60mph at the time possibly the oil pressure gave the plug it’s last push! We do not know - all we know is that we did everything properly in maintaining the car. I hear of the same thing happening of a Toyota and a Mazda - in both those cases, the dealers immediately accepted responsibility and had the cars repaired. GM is different apparently - or at least the dealer we HAD been dealing with. Sad… as we like GM but that has to change now!Hi - appreciate your comments. We were 120 miles from home when all this happened. New dealer is one of the better ones around and highly considered by GM - impeccable reputation and I trust them. Local GM dealer (where all oil changes since new and on time have been done - nowhere else) is the one causing the problem. As I mentioned in another post, I have heard that some Toyota and Mazda owners have experienced similar plug issues but in both cases, both the dealer and manufacturer have assumed  responsibility and together took care of the matter quickly. I have been waiting over 4 weeks and wasted 3 weeks waiting for some action from a GM customer service type (they call them “Ambassadors”) - I was not impressed with that interaction.Hi again Keith,  we are now dealing directly with GM who are working on some form of solution.  I will keep everyone posted on developments!  I am trying to put “shame” publicity on the shoulders of the offending GM dealer - the one who last touched the vehicle (in fact the only one to ever touch it). Onward…I have a feeling the “ambassador” is not going to side with you
The fact that it’s been quite awhile already makes me wonder if you’re being given the run around
I assume you have receipts which prove that the “offending” dealer has serviced your car from day one
If/when you are told that you’ll have to pay for the entire repair yourself, I would seriously consider small claims court or an attorney
Another idea . . . the second dealer could take some pictures of the messed up threads, the one where the drain plug was supposed to screw in, before the 1st dealer or somebody else decides to take possession of the car, the engine or oil pan, and conveniently misplaces it
I’m assuming the threads ARE either cross-threaded or stripped out altogether . . . ?“Ambassador” = BS artist. PR flack. Professional staller.
Just my opinion, but I believe the problems with drain plugs being left loose, cross-threaded, or overtightened is due to one thing.
Over the past few years dealers have gotten into the “compete with Jiffy Lube” mode. Do it cheap. Better us than them. They’re generally going to hire young guys with little experience and then press them constantly with hurry, hurry, hurry. That leads to mistakes even if one omitted the ham-fisted newby part of it.If the threads look ok, I’m guessing the same as OK above, probably the tech just forgot to tighten the drain plug.  Maybe they got a phone call or a call of nature after they initially threaded it in, then upon their return to the job forgot to fully tighten it.  It’s a bit of bad luck, b/c if they had simply forgot to install  it, then they’d notice when all the oil they just poured in was puddled  on the floor under the car.  (Ask me how I know this … lol  )
Just a fyi note regarding oil changes.   Check the oil level before leaving the shop, then again when you get home.  And the next morning, before starting the car.   Then once a week or so.   It probably wouldn’t have helped in your case, but still a good idea.
It’s not possible to know who’s to blame , that will  have to be resolved by mechanics studying the oil pan and  threads, maintenance records, etc.  Preferably you want to have at least one of the mechanics doing the research and inspections who are working for you.  One thing to check is whether the shop installed the proper drain plug washer, and whether it was a new one or not.  On most cars a new oem washer should always be installed with every oil change.  I expect the result of all this will be some type of compromise, where you’ll get a replacement engine, but not at the full price,  at some discount.  Maybe you’ll pay for the engine, and they’ll pay for the labor.  something like that.Really anything can happen, and it doesn’t hurt to check the plug and filter in addition to checking the oil when you get.   I try to do everything in a particular sequence to make it harder to miss something.  Several times the next day I have gotten under the car to check if I tightened the plug or not because I couldn’t specifically remember doing it.  Never forgot but I did have to check.  Also depending on the type of pan, I always without fail use a new crush washer whenever doing the Acura.  I don’t know what they cost, something like 50 cents but I believe it helps to avoid pan damage and leakage.


 George_San_Jose1:

Check the oil level before leaving the shop, then again when you get home.  And the next morning, before starting the car.   Then once a week or so.


I agree strongly with that advice.
I change my own oil, and, even though I double check everything as I go, I STILL check it every morning for a few days after changing it. Always have.
Back in '79 I took my brand new pickup to the dealer to get the oil changed, in order to ensure that the warranty remained intact. I parked on an incline in my apartment parking lot, and when I got home and parked the truck I looked and saw a honey-colored fluid running down the incline. The dealer shop had neglected to tighten the drain plug. Fortunately, I only lived a mile from the dealership. No damage was done, but if I hadn’t been alert I’d probably have started the engine dry the next morning.
In addition to the checks George mentioned, I’d look under the vehicle before starting it up after having the oil changed. If there’s a small puddle, don’t start the engine until they double check their work.GM vehicles typically don’t use the setup you described
The drain plugs don’t have a separate washer
The drain plugs have a rubber seal, which sits in a groove in the drain plug

engine-oil-drain-pan-plug-gm-11562588-1-piece.jpg600×600 23.1 KB

The seals are usually not replaced, until/unless they’re flat as a board and no longer doing their jobYeah you have to buy the whole plug.  I think it was $7.You actually can buy the seal . . . rockauto, for example . . . but I feel it’s not worth itThx for the info - appreciate it!",,,,

531,Driving a Honda Civic Hybrid without the hybrid battery?,Maintenance/Repairs,50,89.4k,"My 2005 Civic Hybrid has been an AMAZING car (160,000) up until last week when I got the news that the hybrid battery was dying 
From what I’ve read, the Civic Hybrid has a separate starter, so it doesn’t need the hybrid battery to start up. Is it possible to let the hybrid battery die and keep driving the car as a regular Civic?
I’m not so fanatical about the loss in mileage, I’m just trying to hedge my bets on the best way to spend $2800: to replace the battery or bank that money and drive this as long as I can and have a fat down payment on my next ride. At the moment, the car is still driving great, though no one can give me a reasonable estimate of how long until the battery goes belly-up.
Thanks ahead for any ideas on this conversation!

Food for thought . . .
There are other options, besides a brand new battery
There are companies which specialize in this thing.  Bring them your battery, and they’ll sell you a battery which they’ve already refurbished.  Or they’ll rebuild yours
While some may condemn me for suggesting this . . . the main battery on your car isn’t that hard to get to.  If you disconnect the 12v underhood battery, turn off the 144V batery switch, wait at least 5 minutes, and work smart, you can tackle this yourself
But if you’re not at all mechanically inclined, and aren’t brave, pay someone else to fix it
By the way, I assume your IMA software is the latest version?
If the car is in good shape otherwise . . . and not rusty . . . I’d opt for the repair, versus getting another carI’ve looked into a few companies that do this, and they were pushing replacing with a new battery.
I’m not at all capable of doing that work myself.
I guess I’m back to the original questions: can I drive my Civic Hybrid without the hybrid battery? Is there any danger to me or the the car, and is the only drawback low mileage?Through the grapevine, I’ve heard of Civic Hybrid owners driving with a bad main battery for years
The only obvious problem seems to be greatly diminished fuel economy
If you want to drive the car a few more years, a new battery is not a bad idea
If you just want to fix it and flip it, get a refurbishedIf you don’t have the experience or the safety equipment for working with hybrid batteries, I’d leave it to the pro’s.

TesterYou are going to get some dashboard nag lights but the car should remain drivable indefinitely…Local seller has an AUX 10kv battery pack for a Prius for sale. Says it retails at $10k but he will sell it for 2500. He gets about 85mpg When he uses it in a 20-40mile daily commute. He wants to sell it since he mainly does long distance drives where the pack is not really suited.The Toyota and Honda packs are completely different. Not compatible…Yes, Toyota/Honda are different. Thought it was somewhat ironic op has query about driving with NO battery pack vs this instance where you may have 2 battery packs. The Toyota aux stuff has an outboard control box assy and it wires into vehicle. Somehow. Maybe the manufacturer makes an aux pack for Honda stuff.I’d drive it as is, save up for the new(er) car.of course they pushed a new battery. more profit. that doesn t mean you can t still get a re furbished one. you may even find it cheaper to check salvaged parts.
either way, its paid for and if you can drive it as is with a bad battery, you will come out ahead, even with lessened MPG. keep it till you milk every penny from it.
even if you pay the 2800, if it gets you 9 more yrs… depends on how good the rest of the car is.I think that this situation is the sad future for older hybrids. Now if someone can come up with a cheaper alternative for a rebuilt battery…they will sell them quickly and get rich at the same time. The price has to come down on these batteries or hybrids will be relegated to driving the roads and highways without them.While Hondas can drive without the battery, Toyota and Ford hybrids require the big battery for starting.I don’t know how you can “recondition” a battery that has reached the end of it’s service life…These batteries are good for a finite number of charge-discharge cycles…As the cells start to fail, that’s it…Most of these hybrids have an extended warranty on the hybrid battery to cover the replacement of defective batteries. But they don’t replace batteries that have reached the end of their service life…
An option might be locating a USED battery removed from a wrecked car that still has some useful life left…

I don't know how you can ""recondition"" a battery that has reached the end of it's service life.
Because it’s NOT one big battery. It’s a series of batteries…and they all don’t fail at the same time. You can replace just one or more of the batteries at significantly cheaper cost then replacing the whole battery. There have been cases where the owner gets another 5+ years doing it this way.When one cells fails in a car with over 100K miles, the other cells can not be far behind…Yes indeed, you can replace a failed cell with a salvaged used cell(s) and sometimes extend the life of the battery for a considerable amount of time…But it’s a matter of LUCK…Like the Lithium batteries found in computers, they don’t last forever…Besides problems with other older cells going bad after the battery is ‘reconditioned’, I had a problem the last time I checked with the cost of the reconditioned battery vs. a new battery.  The total cost, including labor for removal and installation, wasn’t that much less (about 20%, if I remember correctly) for the reconditioned battery vs. a new battery.  Not worth the risk, to me.pull that battrery out and you got a golf cart.
Maybe there would be enough room for my anvil, shoes and tools, then. Then I could putter down the road to my next client. I could call ahead and have them meet me at the bottom of the hill…so they could help push it the rest of the way to their place.
YosemiteWhen one cells fails in a car with over 100K miles, the other cells can not be far behind...
Not necessarily. And from experience my relatives had definitely not what friends/relatives I know who had this happen to.Like the Lithium batteries found in computers, they don't last forever.... 
You’re right they don’t last for ever…but 20 years is NOT unheard of. The technology changes long before the battery runs out. It’s rare to replace a computer because the battery was no good. And if it is…I guarantee the computer is probably 4-5 generations behind.
The Lithium battery in cars is designed to last well past 100k miles. Many lasting past the 150k mile mark. I know of at least one person with a Honda Civic Hybrid who’s past the 100k mark on the original battery.",,,,

533,Car Died and now won’t start without jump,Maintenance/Repairs,14,379,"I have a 2001 Honda Civic that died a few nights back after a trip. I got it jump started to drive around and charge the battery but it died while idling at a stop. Got it towed back home to work on it and was told it was probably the alternator. Since I just replaced that back in january I was alright with that, and ran an alternator test today to see if that was necessary and it appears that the alternator is still working. (Volt tester jumped from 12.3 volts while off to 14.3 volts once I jump started the car and got it running). After getting it to run for 30 minutes I turned the car off and left for half an hour. Went to restart the car and it died again. Not sure if it is the battery as that is only 2 years old, figured I would check here to see if anyone might know something.


 calvodyl_172108:

Went to restart the car and it died again.


You mean the engine cranks but does not start?Yes, apologies. Still new to the technical lingo.
Apologies, it cranks the first time when trying to start it.I guess its not related to a charging system problem but more like a fuel delivery problem.With the engine off ,press on the gas pedal for 30 seconds then try to start the carAttempted that, but the engine didn;t crank so I am charging the battery and will get back to you once I try it again


 calvodyl_172108:

Attempted that, but the engine didn;t crank so I am charging the battery and will get back to you once I try it again


Did you happen to check what the charge was on the battery?58% on the battery


 calvodyl_172108:

58% on the battery


Which is what voltage?Voltage while not on bounces between 11.4 to 12.6


 calvodyl_172108:

Voltage while not on bounces between 11.4 to 12.6


11.4 is too low…your battery may have given up the ghost.Batteries can die prematurely.
I had to replace one once that was less than 3 years old. Luckily it still had a week or two of the 3 year warranty, and I got a brand new one for free.If the engine cranks over fine but will not start you might give some consideration to a failing ignition switch as that has been a problem that has lingered around forever. See if there is a spark at the plugs while cranking.
Some Hondas of this era are under a Recall for this problem but it applies to various decades of Hondas Recall or no Recall.If you need a jump to start I will assume you left your headlights on or battery drained for some reason. Checking the voltage is one thing. A weak battery will show 12.5 volts but what you need is a load tester. It will show voltage then you press a button for a few seconds and it puts a “load” on the battery and you can watch the needle drop.
Jump statring is for emergencies and I abhor the practice. I have seen both batteries die forever during a jump start and I have seen them explode.
If you must jump start and it runs but dies after a mile then your battery is shot, probably from leaving ights on which 2 or 3 times your battery is dead. Then people abuse the alternator using it as a battery charger! Bad! Use a battery charger ASAP after a jump start 24 hours on low amp setting.
The alternator is there to top off the battery while you drive and run accessories. It cannot charge a battery and trying to  make it do so it will die soon from the practice.
You have toasted and abused your vehicle electric system. You can google stuff these days so google automotive batteries (not youtube) and find a bona fide site to learn. Lots to know to take care of a battery. I buy a 4 year battery and can get 7 years out of them by doing the right thing. So learn everything, about cars that you can (forums too often are “Did ya try…”)

534,Ignition coil quality,Maintenance/Repairs,10,243,"I recently had an ignition coil replaced on my 2009 mazda cx7.
I found out that it fairly easy to replace myself.
I want to buy one before the next one goes bad.
However, I have found a very wide discrepancy in prices on those coils.
From $50 for a set of 4 to $71 for a single.
Are there brands which are better?
I also need to know how the cylinders are numbered.
Like which is the cylinder is closest to the radiator etc.
I understand the firing order is 1-3-4-2
Thanks.


 Solved by Mustangman in post #10 


                No that is not correct. That is the firing order, not the cylinder number. @oldtimer_11 is correct. 1 is far left, 2 is next, 3 is next, 4 is the far right. 1,2,3,4.
              
Why buy something you may never need ?  And if you do just get one from your local parts house that way if it is bad all you to do is go back and exchange it.The one I replaced failed at 106K miles.
The others will eventually fail, so having a spare seems prudent.I assume you’re looking on Ebay or Amazon?  It is true, there are a lot of super-cheap aftermarket parts available–especially things like ignition coils, ignition wires, sensors, fuel pumps, water pumps, etc.  The sad truth is that more often than not, you get what you pay for.
I would avoid buying any aftermarket auto parts which are not made and sold by a reputable brand, such as Gates, MotoRad, AC Delco, Standard Motor Parts, Denso, etc.  While I would never pay the inflated prices charged in chain stores such as AutoZone and O’Reilly, I’d also be wary of anyone selling a new part for less than RockAuto.  It is probably counterfeit, or just a cheap knockoff.Thanks. I found a NGK one on Rockauto.I prefer Rock Auto over the local parts stores were I can enjoy the pleasure of returning over priced defective parts.For this car I don’t think you could go wrong with either NGK or Denso.  Those two are my go-to brands for electrical parts for my Subarus and Toyotas.Since it is a transverse 4 cylinder, they are all the same distance from the radiator. Standing in front of the car, cylinder 1 is on the left.Is this correct?
cx7797×450 30.9 KBNo that is not correct. That is the firing order, not the cylinder number. @oldtimer_11 is correct. 1 is far left, 2 is next, 3 is next, 4 is the far right. 1,2,3,4.

It shouldn’t.  Wait til it fails - if it fails. We’ve owned 5 vehicles that had that type ignition system (one coil) with well over 300k miles and them and the original ignition coil. Ignition coils were more problematic with the older Point/condenser systems…But they usually are pretty  reliable since electronic ignition systems.
The newer systems now have a coil on each spark-plug. They are seeing higher failure rates. Might because of the higher heat they are subject to. But the still seem to be lasting a lot longer then 100k miles. I have over 150k miles on my 14 highlander and still have all the original coils. My wife’s 07 lexus with over 250k miles have all the original coils. But I have heard of them failing every now and t hen.",,,,
535,Honda Radio Stays on With keys out!,Maintenance/Repairs,14,15.1k,"Hi, does anyone have any ideas on this. My 2003 Honda Accord radio will turn on while the car keys are not in the car. It’s been happening for months now.  If I leave the radio powered on while the car is off it will drain the battery by the time I try to start it again in the morning.  If I turn the radio off before the car keys are out I can still see the radio receiving power (the clock on the display lights up).
I had a different issue about a year ago where if the radio was on it would make really loud popping noise then go silent. I could usually get it back by turning it of an on several times. I  it to a car audio shop who soldered the connections in the radio and I haven’t had the problem since. After this I also had an iPod/iPhone adapter installed. It seems as though the issue with the radio staying on may have started somewhere around that time.
Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this?  The guy at the car audio shop says that he thinks the radio is just bad and that Honda had a huge problem with radios in Accords from that year.  However I don’t want to spend money to put a new radio in only to have the same issue after.  Can anyone help??I’m in agreement with the “guy at the car audio shop.” A new radio will fix your problem. Just make sure your new radio will connect directly to your original radio wiring. No cutting…no splicing.I agree with “missileman” go talk with the people at the car audio shop i feel you will get a better install from them. check out Cruchtfield’s web site and see whats out there and what  features you want, spend some time playi ng with the units on display make sure your ok  with the controlsI agree with the new audio unit. I’d like to suggest that if you do the job yourself you get an “adapter plug” from an automotive audio store. The plug gets spliced to the new unit’s wires on the kitchen table and plugs directly into your cars original wiring harness. It prevents the problems often associated with butchering the harness. I’ve done a few and they’re super easy.I would suggest a new radio is not going to fix this problem.  That is because a radio is not alive; and has no brains.  It does not know if the key is in the ignition or not.  If it is receiving power - the radio is capable of turning ON.  Just press the power button.  If no power is going to the radio - it will not turn on - no matter how many times you press the power button.
From your description - the ignition key is not shutting off available power to the radio unit.  A miswire or some such exists with the current radio and its wiring harness.  Insulation gone touching metal - allowing power to flow; or the power wire being hooked up to an always hot connection; etc.  You can get the setup wiring manual for your radio online.  You should have a service manual for your vehicle as well.  With these two items and some detective work - you can fix your problem.  (unless the ignition switch is defective)  If you install a new radio yourself - you will still have to figure all of this out… So if you like the current radio - figure it out with this one.I tend to agree with DS77, with the caveat that it is possible, though unlikely, that somehow the switched power side of the radio has become linked to the constant power side internally through some means (something metallic falling into the radio in just the right spot, or perhaps an impressive case of tin whiskers). This should be easy to test - unplug the radio, stick a multimeter on the switched power wire of the cable that you unplugged, and see if any power is going to it. If it is, then your radio is not to blame, and you need to look more in the area of your ignition switch.I expect at some point someone has made a wiring modification which wired the radio to the “hot at all times” point rather than the “hot in ON” point in the electrical system.  There’s probably a reason they did it this way.  Or they made a mistake and connected the wire used to provide power to the radio memory and clock to the radio itself.  In any event,  if this is the case, then you’ll just have to remember to turn the radio off when you exit the car.
The other possibility if the wiring remains as when the car was new is a sticking relay somewhere.  Most cars have a relay or relay that turn on when the key is in the “on” position.  And power to the stuff that is supposed to be powered when the key is “on” goes through that relay.  If that relay sticks on, that would explain the radio staying on.
A faulty ignition key switch is another possibility, among others.  An experienced auto electric expert could figure it out no problem I expect.IMHO, it depends on how the radio is being “fed” power.  Once car radios began to have digital displays and presets, typically there were two power connections to the radio–one for the main power, and one to “keep alive” the clock and memory presets.  When you turn off the key, the main power would die but the keep-alive connection would continue to provide a small amount of juice.  Often this connection would be fed from the same always-on power feed that fed the lighter socket or interior lights.
With increasingly complex stereo and nav systems, this may no longer be the case–it may be the system ALWAYS has power available and either its internal logic or the car’s “body controller module” (or both) may determine whether the radio should be on or not.  If the car allows you to keep listening to the radio with the key off until you open a door, it may be set up like this.
In the former case, I would suspect either someone made a mistake when modifying the wiring to add your i-stuff adapter, or the head unit has a fault.
In the latter, it could be the head unit or the car’s BCM.  And it could still be any wiring modifications that were botched.
The way I would approach this personally would be to first check or have checked the mods that were done to add your adapter, maybe removing it for troubleshooting.  If all appears well there, I’d replace the head unit next.Like Oblivion was saying, your vehicle may have a way to bypass power to the radio while the key is off. In my van, power to the radio stays on while the ignition is off for a short time at least and then automatically cuts off when opening a door or times out by itself. I would suspect some sort of power module or BCM is causing the trouble.Wow thanks for all the ideas and suggestions. I’m  actually going to try replacing the radio with an aftermarket one. I’ve seen as much information pointing to this being the problem as I’ve seen pointing to an issue with the car. Really praying this works. I will post an update as soon as I know the results.Replaced the radio today and so far so good. Hopefully it stays that waySo I want to understand the issue a bit more as to I maybe having the same issue. Which is where once the car (04 Honda Accord ex coupe) is off and key is out of the ignition the radio backlights stay on but radio doesn’t turn on at all. My fix for it was removing the radio fuse but obviously that’s not the fix I want. Any help or answers if it wasn’t answered already?.The person who had this problem 8 years ago in their last post said they replaced the entire radio to solve the problem.I read that part but I’m wondering if there was another solution to the issue or just thatWhat happens when you open the door after pulling the key from the ignition?",,,,

Start by checking the grounds. If the ground is rusty or corroded off, current will find another path. Make sure the fuse is tight as @Tester suggested.

Actually, I had the same problem with the oem lights


Agree with @Mustangman and @VOLVO-V70, you need to fix that first before trying the LEDs. Did you try changing the fuse?I have not changed/tightened the fuse. I will try this tomorrow. With the original lights, I got the problem to go away by taking out all of the wires that lead into the portion of the fuse box that is under the hood, then cleaning out the terminals. I tried this with the LED’s with no avail. Could this really be something as simple as a fuse that isn’t tight?This may be corrosion on the wires.  I had similar problems on a 98 Jeep Wrangler, a few were fixed with contact cleaner, a few I had to wire around and put an inline fuse in as I could not easily access the connectors in the bottom of the fuse box.  Check all the grounds first as they easily become corroded.Is this not a circuit breaker instead of a fuse?  I thought this was pretty universal since the 80’s.  A circuit breaker heats up, the circuit opens, then cools down and the circuit closes again.  So could be either a faulty breaker or the circuit is being overloaded or shorted.

so nothing over my face or above me, not even arms abo…
              
I’ve only gotten nausea when I’ve snapped off something important, rare or expensive. Really bad when it is all 3!Maybe if you try to narrow it down. Does it only happen while you are under a particular car? Does it happen anytime you lie down on a creeper no matter where it is? Do you experience nausea in any other situations? Try and figure out the triggers and go on?Thanks for responding.  The situation is very much like what the person at the forum link describes, along with the things suggested by comments there (like head injury, airflow/fumes, eyes, no trouble from other lying on his back, etc) – which were ruled out in that exchange.
I’m wondering if others have similar experiences to help rule out exertion in particular.I tend to be too busy being mad at myself to feel nausea on those occasions.  Have you tried shutting off the engine?
Are you allergic to any animals or fur? Perhaps something is living in/on the underside somewhere or comes over and pees on your wheels when you’re not looking.

Maybe if you defined nausea better it could help. possibilities are, Sick to the stomach, ready to throw up, dizziness, faintness, lightheartedness, inability to think, muscle weakness or control, not asking for me but when you see a doc it may be helpful to describe.Nausea is a symptom of heat stroke, but it’s also a symptom of about four dozen other conditions, and a side effect of several medications, so that probably isn’t much help, and you’re not likely to be properly diagnosed online anyway, unless you’re a car. The only thing I can add is that this symptom hasn’t ever happened to me as a result of working under a car.  Sore back, knocked noggin, rust in the eye, yeah, but never nausea. I’ve experienced contact dermatitis from solvents several times, and nearly passed out from carbon monoxide one time though.  This latter incident is said to have damaged some brain cells, but I dun’t notize anywhingz … .lol .One of the problems I have while working on cars is not drinking enough liquids, get dehydrated and start feeling bad.A  form of claustrophobia maybe?  I am a fairly large and clumsy man and on a trip to Europe I said to my adult grandson who arranged and accompanied the trip, “EVERYTHING IN EUROPE IS TOO CLOSE TO ME!” after about the 15th time my body had slammed into something  that should not have been that close.  From the too small showers, too small bathrooms, too short doorways, tiny elevators and stone walls inches from your fenders with gigantic buses coming the other way on too narrow roads.  Europe just doesn’t fit.well, it’s been a couple of days, and it seems this is not a common thing – thanks to all who responded!Are you talking about working under the car on a creeper, or standing under it while it’s on a lift?
If it’s the former, you might check for acid reflux. That can cause nausea symptoms when lying on your back.Lay down on the floor inside your house for a half hour. Does the same thing happen?The former, and it doesn’t happen when otherwise lying on back.  Thanks for responding.no
Thanks for responding.Try lying on your creeper while not under the car. Both in the garage and outside of it (if it’s warm enough).
I wonder if you don’t have a carbon monoxide problem in your garage. Or perhaps there’s some sort of outgassing from the creeper materials that’s causing you discomfort.LIke the person at the link I provided, no creeper involved, and air circulation is not an issue.
I’ve been hoping to rule in / rule out the exertion factor (possibly combined with other factors).What happens if you run up the steps?no nausea

Not yet but I will.Second the above, clear the tracks and then help the motor with a push in the direction you want to seat to move. Some things need to be used to stay functioning.

Clear the tracks of what? There are no obstructions visible.There might be something jammed and completely in the track (not visible). I helped my wife get a small bottle of hand sanitizer that fell between the seat and console. I had to get down and look at the seat track, and it was not easy to see inside it. Maybe your Kia is different.Possibly. If I get a chance I’ll try a vacuum.Question for the experts: does the gear have a clutch or other mechanism to prevent the unit from stripping gears?There’s a shear pin holding a pinion gear to the motor shaft.Does it move in any direction? Front, back, up, down, tilt?Every seat adjuster that I have worked on had a direct drive motor, no gears. There is a plastic square drive output socket on the motor that connects to a cable similar to a speedometer cable that connects to the seat adjuster.
If Hyundai is using shear pins it seems that they are designed to fail. A seat motor has limited strength and has an internal circuit breaker in case the motor stalls, it doesn’t need a clutch or shear pins.

Does it move in any direction? Front, back, up, down, tilt?


Sorry, I should have been more clear. It moves up and down and I can change the angle of the seat back.

541,Radio changes volume by itself while moving,Maintenance/Repairs,27,81.0k,"Hi fellow car lovers,
We have a 2007 Mitsubishi Pajero (not sure the current equivalent in US, it used to be the Montero but I think they have since discontinued it). It’s a great car.
One rather annoying issue we are having with it at the moment…
The radio changes volume by itself. It goes up, it goes down, all on it’s own without any input from us. Here are some observations:

Only happens when the car is in motion, at a stand-still it is fine.
Only happens when listening to radio, not CD player or DVD player.
The car does not have a “knob” for the volume, it is just buttons (rules out potentiometer thingy)

There are steering wheel controls, but the fact that the volume changes only happen when listening to the radio, and not CD, make me believe it’s not those. Same with speed-sensitive volume controls. We have turned those off in the settings and it still does the same. Even with them on or off, the CD volume works as expected.
Does anyone have any ideas what’s going on?
Thanks!!!My Pontiac does that.  Its a feature to keep the volume at a constant level as road noise increases.  I like it.  I believe there is an option to turn the feature off so might want to take a look in the owners manual.Agree with bing, sounds like speed compensated volume control. Hondas have it as well, you just need to read the manual on how to shut it off.Just throwing something out there but if this car is not equipped with a speed compensated volume control it’s also quite possible the problem could be a faulty radio head; manual potentiometer or not. Even the button types can go stupid at times.
Just a few months ago I had to change the radio head out in my Lincoln as it had developed 2 problems; both due to the washboard roads that are beating things to death. One was the CD skipping and the other was the volume/ON/OFF controls which had developed a mind of their own.
At times the radio would pop on or off and at other times the volume would rise without any input from the driver.Well, I am sure it’s not the speed compensated volume thingy… as we have turned it off (and on) and the issue still occurs in both settings.
I am not sure it could be the buttons themselves, as the issue only happens when listening to the radio. CD plays just fine with no changes in volume.
I don’t think it’s a signal strength issue either since we live in the middle of the city and it can fluctuate volume even when the car is stationary.
Has anyone had this problem before?
Thanks for the replies!Regardless of what you find I’m betting the only way to solve the problem will be to replace the radio. Your radio probably has some kind of volume indicator, a bar graph, or number. Mine briefly displays a number when the volume is changed. If that isn’t changing when volume of the radio changes then the problem, as you have guessed, probably isn’t with the main amplifier.Each component in your system has its own pre-amplifier. My guess, the pre-amplifier for the radio has gone glitchy.Car radios are 100% disposable, non-repairable, products…There are a number of places where you can send your defective radio into and have them fix it, though if it is just a standard unit it may not be cost effective to do that. More expensive units can be worth fixing, especially over the dealer cost of a new unit. The trouble you are having does sound like a problem inside the radio section and replacing it may be the best solution to the problem. Ebay is a good place to find original replacement units. That way all your external controls for the system will still work.Just make sure you get the security code for the new radio if you buy off ebay.  That and Craigs list is where stolen ones get dumped.I was considering replacing it anyways I guess. My only concern if it’s not within the radio, and it’s a problem with the antenna/connection… how can I diagnose this?
Thanks!You have to check the owner’s manual and see if your car is equipped with volume adjustment for speed and how to disable it. If you don’t have this option, then I would just change the radio with a decent aftermarket one.
Crutchfield has a lot of info and selection, with installation guides and accessories.You don’t have to be concerned about this trouble being external to the radio. A faulty antenna would be a different problem, like not picking up any stations. The trouble you describe has to do with the audio gain for the radio section, which is done inside the radio. If the external volume control  was a problem I would think the other functions would be effected also and not just the radio.The radio in my 98 Pathfinder did this. It was a known problem with all systems made by Clarion back then. So it may be the head unit.Alpine makes some of the best head units out there. that being said they also =have units that with an adp. that will let the remote radio controls work with your new radio. I have owned about 5 different Alpines over the years never one had any problems over the years. Cruthchfield does have a lot of good info. pay a visit to a local mobil electrincs store and talk to them. there our other brands out there that our very nice and won’t break the bank. when shopping also check out the instale bay at the store your thinking about doing bussenesss with, is it while lite, clean does the techs take pride in what they do? do they show the same care about changing the radio in your car vs.  doing a very large a/v system with all the bells.I have the EXACT same problem in my Prius V 2012.  It doesn’t happen with satellite radio, CD, or Bluetooth, just the radio.  I bought the car used and had custom racks drilled into my roof right after purchasing so the dealership is saying they must have knicked a wire, but the rack people say no way.  I’m dying to know if you ever found the problem!  ThxHaha this post was so long ago I thought I would forever be the only one.
No sadly still haven’t figured out the problem nor a solution. Some people said maybe bad antenna connection but I never investigated. Possibly bad grounding was mentioned as well. I had been intending to just replace the whole unit but it’s one of those premium sound systems that won’t cope with hot swapping a new eBay unit in. So basically we just listen to podcasts and music from iPod, if we use radio we just live with it.
I would be skeptical about the dealer saying drilling holes into the roof caused this… Most cars I have seen the antenna runs along the headliner inside from the roof not near where a roof rack would go. Who knows… You are the only person to ever reply to me saying you had the same problem haha
Hopefully you have better luck than me!

Regardless of what you find I’m betting the only way to solve the problem will be to replace the radio.


Kudos on the tests you’ve used to eliminate some of the possibilities.
Since you’ve eliminated them, my money is on the radio.
This is just a wild guess, but I’ll bet there’s a preamp in the radio circuitry that’s not used in the CD player circuit. These units are no longer made to be repaired, and even if it could be I doubt if you could find a repair shop to do it. If you did, it would probably cost a lot more to repair it than to replace the radio. You can buy a new unit  for the cost of one (perhaps two) hours of shop time. Individual parts probably couldn’t even be purchased by a tech. An individual part used to be a wirewound resister, or a capacitor, or a transistor, or something of that sort. Now it’s all in thin-film “chips”. And the frame structures are now all ultrasonically welded plastics or “pop in” parts with little plastic bifurcated “mushrooms” that cannot be disassembled nondestructively once popped together.
NOTE"" should you decide to replace the unit yourself, I strongly urge you to spend the extra $20 on an “adapter cable”. This is spliced onto the new unit’s leads on the kitchen table following easy-to-follow directions and then plugs directly into your OEM wiring harness. Installation of the radio is much, much easier and the problems often associated with butchered wiring harnesses are avoided. If you have a shop install the new unit, INSIST that they use an adapter cable. If they give you and argument, go elsewhere.
I’ve installed a few radios and CD players over the years, and there’s absolutely no way I’d do it (or allow anyone else to) without an adapter cable.Unless the radio is connected directly to the CAN bus, I’m guessing there must be an input for the speed sensor.  There must also be some voltage level that can be measured when the car is not moving.  If that sensor input can be disconnected and the input is fed with that stationary voltage, you should be okay.  Just a thought.If it was related to the radio signal wouldn’t it be staticky instead of the volume dipping? But, since it only occurs when in motion then it makes me think there is noise interfering with the signal.  And, since satellite radio is fine then it’s specifically that wire.
The racks are mounted into the roof right where the radio wire runs, but since it is typically taped to the headliner the gap should have prevented damage.

Now it’s done this a few times, and seems to happen after it’s warm, when you try to start it after a short trip to the store. Then it’s fine again the next day.
The car is a Citroen ZX 1.4i from 1992, Bosch single point fuel injection.
Things I’ve tried:
changed distributor cap and rotor, no change.
The spark plugs was changed earlier this year by mechanic.
Changed fuel filter in case of bad pressure. I think I can hear it running a little smoother when cold after this, but no change to the problem.
I did change the timing belt myself about a month before this started happening. Could be that, but it started straigth up the first time after change, and I drove it just fine for a month after. It fits better with the cold weather coming and thus greater temperature changes from cold engine.
No check engine light when it does start. It never stops either after successful start, and I can’t hear any random noises or coughing or anything while it running.
I’m a bit lost on how or what I can troubleshoot next, you guys got any ideas? Checking for spark I guess, but how would that fit with it running smooth when it starts? Fuel pressure fits better with temp change maybe, but shouldn’t that be better after warmup, instead of worse? And also smooth after start? Please help!",,,,

545,Changing transmission filter on 2015 Rav 4,Maintenance/Repairs,12,302,"Getting ready to change trans filter at 62.5K miles on 2015 Rav 4. Already changed fluid about 8 or 9 times so I’ve got that down pat. I had two 1994 camrys and a 2005 camry where I changed those filters by removing the pans/bolts. Maybe I’m older but worried about breaking a bolt. Should I spray them 1st with WD40 and then remove or just remove.  Then when replacing bolts after filter is changed, should I just coat them with trans fluid??? Don’t think I want to put anti seize on them. Thoughts or comments please? thanks. Guess I’m getting older and worried.  Don’t need a snapped bolt to deal with.

Getting ready to change trans filter at 62.5K miles on 2015 Rav 4. Already changed fluid about 8 or 9 times


The transmission fluid???  YIKES!  That’s way too often.I agree; there’s no need to change it that often. Every 25 to 35k miles is fine.
Don’t worry about breaking a bolt. The odds of transmission pan bolts being frozen are very slim. Also, forget the WD-40. That is not a good product for loosening bolts. PB Blaster is far better.
Don’t worry about coating the trans bolts with anything.thanks. I change fluid a lot as it’s a drop and only replaces 50% of the fluid. Gives me something to do. Haven’t done the filter yet on the rav as you can see. The camrys were changed at 60K intervals. Thanks for your comments. I’ve done what you’ve said in the past (no spray, no coat the bolts replacing).  Never had leaks either so I hope that is the case this time.


 oilman:

Already changed fluid about 8 or 9 times so I’ve got that down pa


I don’t think he means on THIS vehicle…
It can’t hurt to WD40 the bolts before you take them out. When they go back in, I personally like a little blue threadlocker. It means they won’t back out on their own and it coats the threads like anti-seize helping to keep corrosion between the zinc plated bolt and the aluminum trans case from locking them in place.  The heads on these bolts usually have “teeth” on the underside to keep them from loosening.the other thing, the trans pan has that plastic overflow tube that you’re supposed to allow excess drain before closing with the drain plug. When I did my 1st fluid change, it drained about a half to full quart or so before I even took the plastic tube out. That means the factory overfilled or I read wrong on how to do it so I just put in what comes out (about 2 5/8s quarts).yeah, when I bought new bolts just in case for my 1994 camrys, the dealer had some blue solid coated on part of the bolts. I still have them. In the past, I’ve never done anything but replaced the bolts and waited 60K for the next filter change. I don’t like anti seize like for plugs as I don’t want that to seep into the trans fluid somehow (not that it could).A 4qt drain/fill is $25 using proper fluid. Same as an oil change. You might do 2-3 oil changes each year. And rarely do trans fluid changes. My fill port is tucked down behind front motor mount. Gm could have installed a 12” metal tube riser to make life easy? No.


 oilman:

blue solid coated on part of the bolts


That was the dry form of thread-locker. Even if you use anti-seize, the gasket keeps it from entering the pan.my fill is behind the driver wheel. I’ve got that down pat. I change the fluid between 5 and 9K usually and use valvoline max life or super tech fluid VI which are Toyota WS replacements. Never had a problem with the Rav. The camrys, I used mostly Super Tech or Castrol import fluid.yes, it is but I had a trans go (1987 grand am) so I am anal with my toyotas/hondas/kia.thanks for all of your comments. Good people on this site. Pretty soon I’ll stop as I’m in my 60’s. I get dizzy/nauseous under cars now laying on my back.Just for others who might have a Rav 4 (2013-2018) and I believe a Camry in that area which had the same engine/trans. I did my filter change yesterday. 65.1K miles. the bolts were so easy to get out (18 of them) except 2 at the curve in the pan farthest from the bumper. Those 2 had to be turned 4 or 5 times to get them to be loose whereas the others were able to be removed by hand after cracking. Those 2 were the only ones with Locktite (blue) on them??? For the one bolt behind that metal bar, I bought a 3/8"" wiggle/swivel adaptor but it’s still to big to get on the bolt head. I tried a 1/4"" 10mm 6 point with the screw driver attachment and it fit easily. Had to use the 1/4"" socket on the screwdriver for torque. The pan started to leak a lot when all bolts were loosened. I drained the fluid from the drain plug. 2.5 quarts normally comes out. Then the pan loosed up on it’s own and dropped off before the last 2 nuts were removed. When I put the  pan down, the gasket popped off on it’s own. It was really hard (like plastic from age/heat but I know it was rubber). No issues at all so far. Then I cleaned the pan which had some gray metal dust on 4 magnets and around them. The filter was removed (2 bolts) easily. It popped out when tugged on due to the rubber O-ring. About another 1.5 qts of fluid fell out.  It was clean inside but the filter paper was a tinge of gray. It did have a plastic mesh netting on the paper so I guess it doesn’t break free into the trans. It was a Denso OEM.  I bought a Beck Arnley filter from Rock Auto and it was just paper. The filter fit right in and I bolted it down. There is a wire harness that is just against the filter but I left it alone (don’t think it was under the 1st filter as it might get crushed).  I tightened the 2 bolts fairly snug with the 1/4"" drive. I put 4 bolts through the new gasket (rubber) to hold it against the pan. I put all 18 bolts back with the 1/4"" drive and snugged them 3X alternating on all sides. In total, almost 4 quarts came out (some spillage from the filter flow when pulled off). I added 3 3/4 quarts of super tech (LV / Mercon VI) and Valvoline Max Life. I used the same washers on the drain plug and fill hole as I’m going to drive it a few months and drop/fill with my std. 2.6 quarts fluid to get the fill amount close to normal from factory. It sat 4 hours and no leaks. This took me about 3 1/2 hours from start to finish. I drove it 0.5 mile and no leaks. I drove it 20 miles today and no leaks. I’ve done 3 other camrys trans filters (3 times each when owned 200K miles before trade in so I never had a leak on those).  Hope this helps anyone who might do one on a Rav 4 or camry.

If your Infiniti is still under the bumper-to-bumper warranty have a dealer look at it.This symptom could be caused by very low coolant levels. If that turns out to be true, let the dealer diagnose why, and then fill and bleed the system.I thought of low coolant but the OP didn’t mention overheating or running hot. There may be air trapped in the heater core though.The HVAC system in your vehicle has two separate blend doors. One for the drivers side, and one for the passenger side.

By 70 mph the vibration can be felt by the passenger through their seat.  I have been told that all 2019 XC60’s do this and that is a feature of the car.  Really!!!No. You probably have wheel or suspension wear or damage.Did the dealership tell you this?   Keep any documentation.  You could try a different dealership.
Have the tires been rebalanced?
Have you noted any unusual wear of the tires?
Have the tires been rotated and has that had any affect?The vehicle is brand new.  It had 250 miles when I got it and it did it on the way home.  I thought it was uneven road surface. They have road force balanced the tires, changed the drive shaft, changed the tires.  They now say that all volvo xc60s vibrate over 65 and they can do nothing about it.Sorry, didn’t notice the year. I do know that it is not normal for a brand new car to have a vibrating steering wheel at 65. So wear is out but damage or faulty parts are still possible. You may need to bring it to a different dealer. Otherwise I’m not knowledgeable on warranty or legal stuff.Thanks so much for responding.  I am really horrified at the dealership’s response,  I will be taking it to another dealership.I’ve tested that vehicle and never felt any vibrations.

Call their bluff. Take another identical car for a test drive with the service manager (or whoever told this tall tale) in the passenger seat.I checked out a few forums, this seems to have a number of posts with the same problem. One resoulution was a bent wheel, but this post might be of help. Others were able to return the car.  https://www.brickboard.com/AWD/volvo/162376/XC50/XC60/XC70/XC90/vibration_problem_defintively_y_totally_solved.html 226folks, i had the same vibration issue on my 2018 volvo xc60. I noticed it after driving for 6 months. Apparently, volvo verbally had acknowledged the problem on the car. The dealer has told me that there is no fix for the issue and thats’ the way all the XC60’s vibrate. Seems to be silly for a $60000 luxury mid size SUV.Yeah thats not normal  .  It can only be a wheel , tires  or the shafts that connect to the wheel .  One of the reasons I won’t touch Chinese made autos .I went back three times.  Finally they kept it for three weeks.  They said they were using my car to figure out what was going on as they had multiple complaints on multiple models.  It turned out to be the drive shaft.  $9700 of warranty work.  Don’t take no for an answer.Hi, I have the same problem but at higher speeds above 160 km/h. I called my delear and he told me that they can’t drive at such speed bu he suggested checking wheels geometry. I haven’t checked yet.I don’t have a solution but where are you able to drive a Volvo 160km/hr? That’s 100mph and I don’t know of any place where that’s legal. Based on your use of km I’d guess rural Canada.Germany — no limit at highway, what is more, the passenger seat also vibrates.Barbara - would you be willing to provide me with more information about what was wrong with the drivetrain? I am experiencing the same issue and they have gone through the same workflow process to no avail. If you’d be willing to share what they wrote on the service order even (or the service order # so they can perhaps look it up) I would be majorly indebted to you! My email is ritchard@gmail.com.I got the gaslighting speech today about how all XC60s do this because of their ‘sport suspension’ so I can’t compare how my car drives with how my XC90 drove or even how the XC40 which I have on loan drives. Apparently they only designed the XC60 to drive like $h!t on the freeway, not the rest of the Volvo lineup.

Any ideas or advice please! ??My wild guess is your transmission is toast.
This isn’t going to be cheap.Good luck.I heard RR were very reliable. Till they aren’t.I can’t tell if this is an engine problem or a transmission problem .  If transmission why the need for heavy braking ?  If engine how did they limp home , just at an idle ?  Maybe they will return with a better description or at least post what a shop found out what the problem was.


 VOLVO-V70:

If transmission why the need for heavy braking ?


If the engine was racing at 6k RPMs, even with a slipping transmission it is possible that the vehicle was hard to stop.



 VOLVO-V70:

Maybe they will return with a better description


Yes, we definitely need a better description, but I have to say that the OP did provide more information with the 6K RPM notation than a lot of people do when they ask for help.It was very hard to stop hense the very heavy bracking and when I did accelerate there was a very clunky noise along with the thick white smoke and high revsWHITE:  was it smoke, or was it possibly steam?Definitely thick white smoke …like you couldn’t actually see through itMy vote is that the transmission’s vacuum modulator diaphragm ruptured, which would keep the transmission from upshifting, create a huge vacuum leak, and suck transmission fluid into the intake, creating smoke.OP went 1 mile at 6k rpm? At what speed? 30mph in 2nd gear would be 3k rpm. Yes I have had ruptured vacuum modulaters. But it was a 66 mustang. What year is this RR?You need to have it towed to a shop that will check it out.
Did you look at the temperature gauge?  The white smoke means an engine problem of some sort. That doesn’t eliminate the transmission, though. You might have more than one problem. One thing you can do is open the hood and check the radiator overflow tank. If it’s empty, then you may have sucked coolant into the engine through a breached gasket.Temp gauge was reading normal  but saying that I fill coolant up yesterday as it came up with a msg then the thng was empty today?No it wasnt at 6000rpm thehole ti.e just when the incident happened  I got home driving at 50 for about 1/2 mile as I was on slip road.Having to add coolant that often and thick white tailpipe emissions indicates a coolant leak into the engine. Tow it to a mechanic you trust and tell him the symptoms. He will check the Landie and determine whether ther really is a leak, where it is, and how much it will cost to repair. Get that taken care of first, then see if the drivability problem remains.WAG: a transmission fluid cooling line let go, spraying fluid onto the exhaust, creating thick smoke. Loss of fluid led to high revving needed to get the vehicle moving. High revving = low vacuum in brake booster = hard braking.Burning trans fluid should really stink. What did the smoke smell like? Bitter? Sweet?",,,,

 davepsinbox_157004:

If you bought it new, it should be under warranty


Even if it was purchased as a used vehicle, the key to the mfr’s warranty coverage is the odometer mileage, as well as elapsed time.   This vehicle has a bumper-to-bumper warranty for 3 years/36k miles–whichever comes first.
Unless the OP has racked-up a LOT of miles in two years, this should be a problem that is covered by that warranty.  As a result, it needs to be towed to a Honda dealership, not to an independent mechanic.ok thankyouIf you have not yet done so, PLEASE open the glove box, take out the booklet containing the provisions of the warranties (there are several, actually), and read the pertinent details.  If–as I suspect–your car is still covered by the 3 yr/36k comprehensive warranty, that means that ANY mechanical or electrical problem will be repaired without cost.
Please don’t waste your money by going to an independent mechanic if the car is still covered by warranty!Oops! I was thinking only the powertrain warranty would have transferred to the second owner. Then again, 36k in two years, 18k a year, isn’t really that far out of line.Someone can correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe that Hyundai is the only mfr that shortens the Powertrain Warranty for the second owner.  To the best of my recollection, the bumper-to-bumper warranty and the full Powertrain Warranty transfers with Hondas, and IIRC, the PW is 5 years/60K miles.No, what I was thinking was that only the powertrain warranty transferred to the second owner rather than the bumper-to-bumper portion. Nothing about shortening the duration.The title to this tread should really read “Dead Battery”.
With many late model vehicles, if the engine will not start and you deplete the vacuum in the power brake booster you will get a brake warning message, it is not the cause of the problem. After the engine is started, vacuum is restored and the message goes away.Which auto manufacture deny the second owner of the vehicle the basic warranty?


 davepsinbox_157004:

No, what I was thinking was that only the powertrain warranty transferred to the second owner rather than the bumper-to-bumper portion. Nothing about shortening the duration.


Hyundai shortens their 10 year/100k Powertrain Warranty to 5 years/60k miles for the second owner.  I’m not aware of any mfr shortening the comprehensive “bumper-to-bumper” warranty,  but I await correction if I am wrong on my second point.


 Nevada_545:

None that I’m aware of, but I’m willing to be educated by dave.I’m the one who was educated. I was under the impression that only the powertrain warranty transferred and I’m happy to be proved wrong.Providing the warranty to subsequent owners improves the resale value of the product; used cars, lease returns, rental cars etc.

In different circumstances you might be right but if my being proved wrong benefits other vehicle owners I can live with a slight embarrassment.

@bcohen2010 and @eddo live in Arizona and should be able to help.Registration - Yes. You don’t get a title if you have a lean on the vehicle. Who ever owns the lean will have the title.

if you are just doing yearly, normal emissions testing, no title is required.  with barcode scanners and fancy computers, you may not even need the current registration.

553,Suggest Me First Car?,General Discussion,24,744,"Hi there!
I’m open for all suggested but there is what I would like to buy inform me up about those. Should I buy one of them or not? If you were me would you buy those? if you wouldn’t let me know what car would you like to buy instead those.
Here My List:
Honda Accord 2010
Kia Forte 2010+
Hyundai Accent 2010+
Ford Fusion 2010+
Nissan Maxima / Altima
Volkswagen Jetta / Passat
Here we go there is my list but as an additional I gotta say something I learned:
As I learned on websites Nissan, Ford, VW, Hyundai, KIA and more have transmission problem I saw on all comments in the USA. It is really scared me. That’s why I’m writing there…
I could find those around 5.000$ (2010+, 100.000 - 130.000miles)
but while surfing on net everyone saying:
VW is not cheap to maintain and (If I would buy VW is not gonna be brand new so if something goes with engine I can’t compensate it)
Nissan has a lot of CVT problems (same as VW)
Ford is not reliable anymore in the USA (same as VW)
Hyundai and KIA are broke down easily and they might not see 200.000mile (same as VW)
Honda (IDK Japan but used for 10 years but the thing is civic feels old even they made of at same years. Seems old)
Guys could you let me know about them which brand is reliable? Which one would you buy for used?
What could be happen if I I buy (Nissan, Ford, KIA or Hyundai except Honda) could it be bad (2010+ 100.000 - 130.000 miles)? And can I use them at least to 200.000miles because even I buy as used they will be around 100.000 - 130.000miles? BTW I really liked the appearance of maxima, forte, and fusion…Why does someone think they can buy a 5000.00 used vehicle and have it reach 200000 miles.  Your list is all over the place and it is possible that the ones that had problems have been fixed or they could have problems on your way home with your recent purchase .
Just do like a normal person - find something you like in your price range - have a shop inspect for things that might be wrong with - that does not mean something won’t break - drive it and hope for decent service.Let’s not kid ourselves here.  None of the models you have mentioned are especially reliable, and buying a 10-year old model for around $5k isn’t a good deal.  It’s too old to have a warranty, but still too expensive to cut bait and run if the car ends up being a money pit.
I would recommend going much older, and buying a 15-20 year old Toyota Corolla, Toyota Camry (only consider the V-6 model if it’s a 2002-2007), Honda Civic, or Honda Accord (4-cylinder model) instead.  An older car will be much cheaper, allowing more money to be put into repairs and maintenance, but can still be just as reliable as a 10-year old model.  Around here, the best “bang for your buck” that you can buy used is a 1997-2001 Toyota Camry or 2000-2005 Toyota Corolla.Skip the VW, they’re money pits. If the Nissan’s have CVT’s skip them. The Ford Fusion (or a Focus if you can find one) before 2012 would be ok to look at. Honda’s I worry about the automatic transmissions primarily. My best advice to you, would be to take Volvo’s advice. Find something in your price range, take it on a good test drive, then have it inspected by YOUR mechanic. It’s not a perfect solution, but when you’re looking at used cars this old, it’s probably the best chance you can give yourself for success. Make sure you have money set aside for repairs, you’re looking at cars a decade old, things break as cars age.If reliability and repair costs are important to you, consult the data in Consumer Reports. Their April issue is always devoted the cars, new and used. They also publish magazines for new car buyers and for used car buyers.
You are looking at older cars, and you might need to find an older issue of CR that covers the model year you are considering.Just thoughts My friend has a Toyota Corolla 2004 on 169.xxx miles still hasn’t even a single problem and he is not take care of it. How much it could be 2004 Corolla, that’s what I mean. Yes that’s not mean every car would be same as it but if I buy used well maintained car at least I would expect struggle to 200.000 mile and all options will be 2010 and around 100.000 - 130.000 mile. Better than 2004 either way.


 CARSss011:

Better than 2004 either way.


Not necessarily so. A well maintained 2004 anything could be better that a 2010 that did not receive timely oil changes .  Put the year and miles out your thoughts and let anything you look at stand on its own merits . Don’t you have a relative or friend to go with you to look at vehicles or are you just playing around on Craigslist type places . Also this is your first vehicle so you might be young enough to have really high insurance rates so that should be in your budget plan.


 VOLVO-V70:

A well maintained 2004 anything could be better that a 2010 that did not receive timely oil changes .


The days of “it was only driven on Sundays by a little old lady” being an indicator of a good used car are long gone.   Excellent maintenance is the biggest factor in the potential remaining life of a used car.


 bcohen2010:

Honda Civic


I’ve been thinking the same way
Actually I don’t care the maintain cost of course all used car would have cost (brake replace, oil change, fluid etc…) but the thing is I don’t want problem that cause replace the engine It’d be cost same price as the car. Other way of course used cars will be cost I know that but If everyone says that if I buy used medium maintenance 2010+ (100-130k mile) Fusion, Forte, Maxima, Accent I would have a problem with engine even I care of them but they couldn’t stand at least to 200k miles I will not choose them because the engine will cost as themselves price but you think they would struggle at least 200k with maintain problem why wouldn’t I buy them they will be cheaper then Japan.I’m looking places as you said and dealers to find out maintained car but the point is if them maintained enough should I buy them instead Honda even they have same price (or less price then honda) but same mile, year and maintain do you think them will struggle to 200k with minor problems? (I have someone to look at the vehicle to check out)Yeah maintenance is biggest factor but
What if I found same year, close miles, maintained good car (Kia Forte, Ford Fusion, Honda Civic)
Would you buy them instead Honda even honda cost more them they price? or second option if find honda that have same price as them what would you buy If you were me?
I think Honda Civic really seems bad even made at same years then them. They feels more nicer but they are not Japan do you know what I mean thats make me scare. If I buy them because they looks nice I dont want a problem with that would cause replace engine.I’ve said this many times in this forum…any used car the biggest factor is how well it was maintained. Manufacturer is secondary.

Oh come on , where are you getting all these strange ideas .  How many times do you have to be told that any brand or model can be good or bad when you are looking at used vehicles .  Just look around the parking lot at Walmart and you will see all kinds of old vehicles that are still on the road.
And what do you mean by they are not Japan ?


 VOLVO-V70:

And what do you mean by they are not Japan ?


KIA, Hyundai are Korean cars and they have a bad past with recalls, quality, engine problems and other things but a lot of people saying they are not same right now or FORD is American Manufacturer a lot of people saying they not sturdy as a Japan cars and not reliable.
That’s why I am asking even they maintained well should I buy them?


 CARSss011:

The 2006-2009 Civic has problems with the engine blocks cracking and leaking coolant, the warranty was extended to 8 years.
Used cars are not all the same, some are to be avoided.

… and Honda’s record with automatic transmissions is pretty crappy.
Additionally, as Nevada stated, certain model years for Civics have had engine problems.
In addition to cracked engine blocks, there have been a significant number of head gasket problems with certain Civics.I’m in agreement with MikeinNH. Maintenance is the biggest factor when it comes to the condition of most used cars.
I know my opinion is at odds with the majority, but I have never found Euro cars to be any more problematic than anything else and say that as a mostly half Euro/half Asian  auto mechanic with a dab of Italian thrown in.
The trashing SAABs get has amused me at times. It’s amazing how many shops refuse to work on them due to their weirdness but the are not as problematic as perceived and I personally enjoy working on them. Most of that work involved maintenance and normal wear items such as brakes and so on.
My oldest son bought a 2015 Jetta new 5 years ago and other than lube services and one set of tires that car has been perfect with not one visit for any warranty issues.
Keep in mind that the majority of complaints are self-inflicted although the car owners will not admit to nor even realize that is the case.
The guy who sued Toyota some years ago because a ball joint snapped on a Tacoma pickup and sent him sliding to the ditch. According to him that should not happen at 107k miles. Well, that is what preventative maintenance is for and is listed in every owners manual; chassis and steering inspection.My 2 cents which are probably pointless.

556,2014 Chevy Cruze… worth repairing,Maintenance/Repairs,10,411,"Have had the common oil leaks, water pump, coolant repairs done over the last 2 years that seem to be super typical with this car. Anyway, back in August, the turbo charger (was cracked), camshaft cover, and oil cooler were all replaced. Throttle body service was also done.  After 800 miles / 2.5 months, check engine light flashes and diagnostics are showing P0106, P0300, and P1101. Got it towed to the dealership. Initially it was a problem with the valve cover gasket and oil had corroded the coil pack and spark plugs. After back and forth, they are now saying that the camshaft is messed up, timing chain is loose, and they would need to pull it apart/the cylinder head would be tested. That would cost 3600 just to pull apart. They mentioned that there could be more internal damage but wouldn’t know until it was apart so of course more money.
Trying to learn about this so I know what to ask. Unfortunately learning while the car is failing.

Can replacing the camshaft cover mess with the rocker arm to make it eventually fail?
Is it worth potentially putting in a new engine if body is in good shape? Or will another system most likely fail because of the current problems making the car a money pit?

*realized I missed putting the mileage. 57K. Also, no payments

No


Only you can determine if it is worth it. The car is only 6 years old with xxx miles (you don’t say) but the body is in good shape.


Some things to consider.
If you don’t replace the timing chain and just button the car back up it is in tradeable condition… to a dealer. I would not want to sell it to a friend or family or even a stranger knowing the timing chain time bomb is ticking.
If you are not making payments, sure just fix the car. There is some risk the transmission or AC would be the next to go but at least the car isn’t dead with a payment due.I would fix it then sell the car before it becomes a real money pit…Too many issues for a 6 year old carI agree with Mustangman, however whether or not you owe money on this car really changes nothing.  In fact, a person who owes a monthly payment on a car is even less likely to be able to afford thousands of dollars of out-of-pocket repairs than someone who owns the car outright.
Regardless, there is no way on Earth I would spend $3600, or even $1600 just on diagnostic labor, which is sure to result in an even higher final cost once internal damage is found.  Especially for a car which has had constant problems, and needed repeated major repairs–despite not being very old or high in mileage.
Furthermore, I would not pay to replace the engine in a car which appears to have design defects which cause the engine to go bad.  The only time I would pay to replace an engine is if the model itself is reliable–which this one is not–but the engine failed due to an external cause, such as overheating, oil filter blew out, or improper maintenance caused by a previous owner.  It does not make sense to replace a failed/failing engine of a defective design with another working engine of the same defective design, unless someone else is paying such as a warranty.
I think the smart thing to do is get rid of this car and buy something else.  If you own the car outright, you can sell it on Craigslist as a “mechanic special” or trade it in to a dealer.  If you are still making payments, you are going to have to trade it in and roll whatever negative equity exists into the new loan.
Around here, $3600 could buy an excellent used car with relatively low miles, and no rust or body damage.With out seeing the vehicle but just going by the list of problems I say it is replacement time . Even if the future problems are minor you are going dislike this thing as long as you have it.


 bcohen2010:

Doesn’t your second sentence contradict your first? The worst possible case is a broken car you can’t afford to fix that you are still making payments on.I’m skeptical of all these problems the dealer says you have. For that money, get one or two more opinions. This assumes you changed to oil before the oil life monitor got to zero.Just to clarify, by cam cover do you mean timing chain cover or camshaft cover? Neither one would cause a camshaft or rocker arm to go bad. You mention cam cover being replaced and now there is an alleged cam problem so the questions do arise.
The codes you provide are related to a random misfire and MAP/MAF codes which can be a far cry from engine destruction.
I’ve had some thought on this one and I have to wonder if you have been yanked around a bit on this car and are still being yanked around. This seems like a lot of serious issues for a 2014 with only 57k miles on it. The one exception might be if you bought it new and absolutely whaled it into the pavement on a daily basis.
And they want 3600 dollars to go on a fishing expedition? I don’t think so. And “test” the head? I don’t know their definition of that.
There is no way on Earth that it should cost anyone that kind of money to discover anything. Sorry  I can’t be of more help here without hands on but something kind of stinks about all of this.First, get a second opinion. Second, if the situation really is dire, I’d have a used engine installed and start looking for a replacement vehicle.


 Mustangman:

Doesn’t your second sentence contradict your first? The worst possible case is a broken car you can’t afford to fix that you are still making payments on.


There is no contradiction.  Whether or not a large amount of money is owed for a car does not change the analysis of whether or not it is worth spending X amount of dollars to repair that car.  Of course a person who lacks the means to pay for the repairs is going to be stuck, even if the car was clearly worth fixing.  Similarly, even a person who owns the car outright should cut their losses and sell/junk it if it’s clearly not worth fixing.
Let us consider the situation which many people found themselves in 8-10 years ago with Chrysler vehicles equipped with the 2.7L engine.  Some people owned these cars outright and made the decision to have the engine replaced (if they could afford it) or to junk the car instead.  Others owed huge loan debts on these cars, and when the engine failed were forced to default on the debt and handle the consequences of a large defaulted debt later on (collections, lawsuits, bankruptcy, etc).
Regardless of any debt which may or may not have been owed, a smart person would have cut their losses and junked the car, because replacing a failed engine of a defective design with another used, new, or rebuilt engine of the same defective design is not a good economic decision.  It only makes sense to do such a thing if someone else is paying, such as the manufacturer or an extended warranty.


 bcohen2010:

Whether or not a large amount of money is owed for a car does not change the analysis of whether or not it is worth spending X amount of dollars to repair that car


Yes it does. You can’t make these decisions in a financial vacuum. If you are going to default on a car loan it matters a lot and as such should be considered in the decison.
You cannot predict that the exact same failure will occur. Even if you can, you have the option of fixing and selling the car or walking away and taking the loss. If it is financed, you risk destroying your credit if you walk away. If you own it outright, you can walk away with a loss but no other effect. Your example was that exact situation.
You make your decisions your way, and I’ll make them my way. And I’ll advise accordingly if asked.",,,,
557,2013 Toyota Venza - when to swap tires?,Maintenance/Repairs,17,564,"I bought my Venza new in Dec. 2012. It only has 36K miles and always parked in my garage. Still have the original tires and plenty of tread. I know that over time the tires deteriorate even though they look great. When should I replace the tires?


 TomF15:

When should I replace the tires?


Now …I can’t match Volvo’s level of snark so I’ll try for a factual answer. Michelin says have your tires inspected annually after five years regardless of mileage and never let them go past ten from the date of manufacture. https://www.michelinman.com/howLongTireLast.html 1. I replaced a set of Firestones after four years with about 30k on them. That said, it’s probably a good idea to go ahead and replace yours since neither of us knows what condition they’re in or when they were made.Thanks for your input, DaveTo be fair, even tire dealers say that a tire must be replaced when it is 10 years old, and a 2013 car isn’t 10 years old yet.  I would replace the tires once they are 10 years old, unless there are any visible cracks in the rubber–in which case I’d replace them now.
It is entirely possible that these tires are still in excellent condition since the car is kept in a garage, in which case the 10-year limit will be the deciding factor.  The DOT code on the sidewall will tell you the manufacture date.I think I’d be looking to replace them, because they are OEM.  In my experience the original tires do not wear very well and have never really made it past about 40,000 miles.  Yours may still be OK tread wise because they have hardened some.  At your usage rate though you likely will only need one more set of tires so why wait I guess?My rule of thumb:  If you live in a hot climate - AZ, TX, CA, NV, and FL - then 6 years is the limit.  If you live in a cold climate - MN, WI, ND, MT, and ID -  Then 10 years is the limit.  States in between are … ah … in between.Venza is heavy too. Am surprised you have a ton of tread left on Oem tiresRead https://www.tirerack.com/tires/tiretech/techpage.jsp?techid=138 2 and https://www.tirerack.com/tires/tiretech/techpage.jsp?techid=183.You need to know how old the tire is.
Not how old the vehicle is or how many miles are on the tires.
That’s why you look at the date code on the tire to determine how old the tire is.



tirebuyer.com 2



What is a tire date code and where do I find it? | TireBuyer.com 2





TesterIMO, parking in the garage can extend the life of the tires, depending how much time they spend away from the garage. The garage can mitigate heat and sunlight effects, and could extend tire life if you live in a hot climate.Besides heat, sunlight, and miles, there’s ozone.  That can degrade tires in areas with high ozone, even out of the sun and heat.  That’s how ozone was identified as a pollutant - a warehouse in LA had new tires in storage, they ended up cracked because of the high ozone in LA at the time (decades ago).
Thank you for your input.Thank you for your inputThanks for the infoThanksMy verano’s are 3 and 8 years old. I am in Florida and both seem to lose air pressure over 3 - 4 days of 4 lbs or mor.e I am at the point of defineately needing NEW tire myself .  Why risk a blowout or flat tire ?The Germans apparently change their tyres at 6yrs for optimum safety, but if in good shape you could see how long they`ll last to save money. Just keep a close eye on the condition of the sidewalls, pressures & treads. Probably ok in steady driving. High speeds, temps might be otherwise. If you drive fast make sure you could control a skid, ie skid training/practise. If not change sooner as they probably harden off so have less grip. Depends what balance of risk/grip vs cost you want & how good your originals are - do they grip well in the wet & cold?
Tyres sometimes/often! leak at the rim especially on alloy wheels, might just need cleaning/sealing.",,,,

559,Weird fuel pump issues on 97 dodge ram! Please help!,Maintenance/Repairs,2,144,"Hello! I have a 97 Dodge Ram 1500 5.9 4x4. Some weird stuff has been happening with the fuel pump and I’m stumped. Here’s the story…
I was driving and suddenly the engine cut out. Electrical on, but engine just dead. Stuck on the side of the road I could crank just fine and maybe get it to sputter and run super rough and then die. Mostly wouldn’t start at all. Luckily I had a friend in the car and we figured out if I bang on the gas tank with a mallet while she turned, it would start, run for a few miles, and then it would happen all over again. After this happening 3 times I finally got home. (Weirdly I could never hear the pump turn on while turning the key half on while stuck on the side of road - doesn’t mean it wasn’t, but maybe this info will be useful…)
I have now replaced the fuel pump, but now am not getting ANYTHING. The previous banging method does not work. I have put a power tester light on to each of the connections in the power harness and it does not light up, not even for a second when I turn the key. So it seems new pump may be good but it’s not getting any power? But then how was the pump running before if even for a few miles all the way up until I replaced the pump? I switched the relay out with horn and relay works, I tested where the relay plugs in and it is getting power.
Any ideas??? Thanks!Does the new fuel pump have a good ground? Needs to be essentially zero Ohms to work properly.You need to test the power to the pump with the pump in the circuit and it should be running. You seem to have a bad connection to power going to the pump. If the ground to the pump is bad you will have voltage on the ground connection due to the unwanted resistance in the ground connection. If the problem is on the hot side the voltage will be significantly less than the battery voltage. Just be sure when you check the power your meter has a known good ground connection for reference.",,,,

Plsese any advice on what to do about my hybrid battery? It’s dead


I assume you know that the Hybrid battery is dead. 1.  check the price of new or reconditioned batteries
2.  Use Kelly Blue Book to have some idea of what your vehicle is worth  3.  Decide if you want to spend that kind of money to fix the vehicle
No one but you and who ever else is in your household can make the decision.What do you mean by the battery is dead?
Do you mean the gas engine runs but the HV battery will not charge properly or stay charged?
Do you mean you ran the car out of gasoline and then ran on the electric until it too ran out of power?
Or do you mean that the car will not “power up” to Ready when you turn it on?
These are 3 different problems with 3 different solutions.Around here the Camry hybrid battery is $1700-1900 installed.  But a dead 12v battery is much more common.I think a dead battery and multiple elec codes will result in a non running/moving hybrid? I don’t think you can drive it with a dead battery. Maybe I’m wrong.",,,,
561,2016 Avalon Rocks Laterally On Turns,Maintenance/Repairs,6,245,"2016 Avalon (used) had been a smooth ride until about four weeks ago. Now it rocks significantly when turning going at moderate/slow city driving speed, especially when turning into one-way (narrower turn angle) streets. It also rocks, to a lesser degree, when going over any part of the street that isn’t perfectly flat, as well as sometimes when slowly coming to a stop.
This started after my block was dug up for “re-paving”, which took the city six weeks to remember to do. More than just “rough pavement”, the dug up street was actually at different levels, so the car rocked considerably every time I very slowly drove down the street. After four weeks of this is when the car started rocking on normal streets and turns.
Is there something that controls the amount of “play” in the Avalon so that the ride isn’t “stiff”? If so, could that have gotten out of whack after the weeks of driving on the dug up, uneven street?It sounds like the struts are bad.    Have your mechanic check them.Is this the same vehicle that in January you asked about ’ play’ in the steering ?
VDC is right , you need this in a shop because you may have serious problems .Sounds like you have a broken stabilizer bar link. Specifically a front one. The stabilizer bar is a big spring that works only when the car rolls to one side. It helps “stabilize” the car.
They are very cheap and should be replaced in pairs.Do you not have anyone who can drive this rocking vehicle and determine if it really has a problem or makes noises that might lead to the problem ?Thank you everyone for your comments.  BTW I did have someone drive it but he said he didn’t feel anything unusual.So, you initially said it was riding differently them before? And now your friend says it is ok? So, you are happy? I wish I had a 2016 Avalon. Heard they rode great. And are reliable.",,,,

IMG_20201106_2200102112×4608 1.36 MBYou can repair windshields some times.
You cannot repair the rear glass. Take it to an auto glass shop and ask them about a repair and a replacement. Replacement cost is likely less than you think.
Please tell me why you seem to have a issue with a) calling a professional shop and asking or b) stopping by a shop for an estimate. You are not alone, we get posts like this all the time. I am curious why.I have no idea what your photo is supposed to show.  It seems that you will not be successful trying to repair this your self.
I also do not understand why people don’t contact places that do repair and at least have an idea of the cost .Can’t fix the rear glass. Like the side windows it’s called “popcorn glass” and is made differently from the front windshield.
Don’t beat yourself up. Even long time glass experts make them.I’d try the Nano glass repair system before replacing the windshield.
Windshield Glass Repair Kit
TesterCapillary action will fill the crack whether gravity works in your favor or not. That’s why water wicks under the cutting board in the counter. Since you have the kit, you might as well try it. Put plastic or newspaper under the crack in the rear deck to catch any filler that falls. If it doesn’t work, you can still take it to a glass repair shop.
You might also try you auto insurer to see if they will cover it. I broke the bottom of the windshield on a Regal I owned. I called my insurer and explained that I broke it. After laughing, they said they would cover it.That is not a crack, that is a mark on the glass or on the window tint film. You may be able to remove it with glass cleaner and a cloth.

Neither have I, but once or twice in this forum we have had people asking questions about their “rear headlights”.  Think of all of the posts over the years about someone’s “V-4” engine, even when their vehicle clearly had either an I-4 or an H-4.
So, almost any type of terminology confusion is possible, I suppose.

I think that’s called “grabbing the low-hanging fruit”.   But… they didn’t make it.
The independently-owned dealership is merely an agent of/for the manufacturer.
If you had phoned VW customer service at the corporate level, it is entirely possible that they would have informed you of the info that the dealership was willing to withhold.
Yes, the dealership(s) should have informed you about the code sticker in your trunk, but a lot of businesses are eager to take easy money from people who are not necessarily well-informed.Depending on who you talk to at the dealer one person may by more willing to find this sort of thing for you than others. Probably varies between dealers as wellI am actually amazed that the security code for the radio is printed on a decal in the trunk.  Doesn’t that reduce the usefulness of having a security code in the first place, since a thief who has entered a car to steal the radio can obviously open the trunk?  Also, I would assume the VW dealer has a way to read and reset the security code, if necessary, independent of this decal.  What if the decal is missing, or you purchased the radio used?


 bcohen2010:

Honda used to . . . still might be doing it, but I’d be surprised . . . put the radio code on the glove box door.  It was on a sticker, plain as dayHonda now has a way to look the code up online, 2002 and newer you can get the code to show up on the radio by pressing 2 preset buttons at the same time.OK, everybody that records their radio code and key code in their owner’s manual and journal when they first get a car like I do, raise your hand.  That’s why the label is in the trunk.  I never had to look myself.The people that answer the phone generally do not know the solutions to these problems, they rely on service technicians to solve these problems.

JustinI would suggest the junk yard module has the same problem as the one you replaced. The local shop diagnosed the problem and they actually touched the car. Why not order a new module from Toyota?The problem might be with the blend door actuator for the drivers side.

The blend door is what controls whether hot or cold air comes out the drivers side.
TesterAs tester says , that sounds like a blend door   In some cars it is an easy job  , in others it can be very expensive , mostly labor cost  due to  dash disaasembly .  Dont know about your particular car .",,,,

I have a unusual problem with my 16 Golf R manual that has been bugging me. After driving the car for a while and then stopping at a light, 3-4 seconds after stopping I feel a slight jolt/clunk. I actually recorded a video from underneath the car in my garage.
I engage 1st gear -> Drive up a couple feet -> put the car in neutral -> after 4 seconds there’s a clunk noise:

566,Automatic headlights are a HUGE safety concern!,General Discussion,34,10.3k,"Several years ago, I rented a Mustang convertible.  It was my first experience with automatic headlights.  It was starting the get dark and the headlights and dash lights came on.  I assumed (I know…bad word) that the taillights were also on.  But while stopped at a stoplight, someone told me that my taillights were not on.  REALLY?  Recently, I encountered a brand new car (had paper plates) where the headlights were on, but there were no taillights.  I felt this was a VERY dangerous situation!  The driver pulled in behind me in a turn lane.  I got out to warn him.  He had NO idea!
I truly believe this is a very good idea with very POOR execution!  New car buyers (and renters) are given a false sense of security with these automatic headlights.  They have no idea that they won’t have taillights until they actually turn the lights on with the switch.
I believe that if car manufacturers are going to provide this “safety” feature, that they should be turning on ALL lights, not just the headlights and dash lights.
Steve
Fremont, CASwil, I’m Not Sure What You’re Describing And Warning About, But None Of It Pertains To The Many GM Cars In Our Driveway !
We have and love DRLs. We have had them for many, many years and hundreds of thousands of miles. We never have to touch the light switch.
When it’s fairly light out then only the DRLs light. When it’s dark overcast or dusk, dawn, or nighttime then all lights, headlights, taillights, dash lights, etcetera, are ON - Every Time ! No Fail ! No Fooling !
I’m not sure what you’ve experienced.
CSASounds like GM got it right, then!   “I’m not sure what you’ve experienced?”  I thought I was quite clear in describing what I’ve experienced.  I think the guy, the other day, was in a Toyota and I had direct experience with a Ford.  Would be interested to hear from drivers that HAVE experienced this phenomenon, as it seems that some car manufacturers are turning on all lights and some are only turning on the headlights.When the auto headlights come on in my 2006 Toyota the tail lights come on too.
My only beef is that in the twilight hours they will go on and off in the shadows of trees, buildings, underpasses etc.
Then I just turn them on manually.“My only beef is that in the twilight hours they will go on and off in the shadows of trees, buildings, underpasses etc.”
CS, the automatic lights on our GM vehicles have built in quite a delay (several seconds) before kicking in or out so that they don’t go on and off in shadows and such as you describe. It’s engineered that way for just that reason.
CSAOur two Ford products have all lights come on automatically.  There must have been something wrong with the Mustang.Ditto to those who stated that there must have been something wrong with the Mustang in question.     While DRLs don’t cause tail lights to go on, the automatically-activated headlights on every car with which I have come into contact cause the tail lights to be activated as well.
Perhaps the OP is confusing DRLs with automatic headlights.CSA, I didn’t describe that very well.
There is a “low pass filter” delay of 15 seconds or so, so individual shadows don’t trip it.
But going from a street with trees or tall buildings to one without, or clouds rolling by etc. can cause cycling up to once or twice a minute.MY '05 Camry works just fine, the delay prevents repeat on & offs.
I have seen a few cars drive around at night with the headlights on and tail lights off and I know what the OP is referring to. It is dangerous. Now I have to make note of the make & model of these cars.
FWIW, my '09 Mazda CX-9 does NOT have DRL’s which I find interesting (car has blue tooth and bunch of other gadgets).Me thinks the OP may have had the DRL’s activated. In which case the tail lights would not come on.Wouldn’t it be a goid idea to wire the instrument panel lights to the same power source as the taillights, then?
I’ve driven old-fashioned cars in urban environs where you didn’t miss not having headlights, but the black instruments clued me in right quick. Given that DRLs are for “ample-light” use, why would you even want instrment lights?SWIL. What you have described are the Daytime Running Lamps, not automatic headlamps. Automatic headlamps illuminate all required lamps.
DRL operate the headlamps only. In some vehicles the DRL operate the lamps at less than full power.The tailights go on on my Acura, Olds, and Pontiac just like they’re supposed to.  Maybe you are talking about the DRLs or daytime running lights.  Those only turn the headlights on all the time and not the tails.   There might be a separate circuit breaker for the tails though that should be checked.  When I was having problems years ago with my Riviera twilight sentinal, there was a separate breaker for the headlights and the rest of the lights.  Personally, I think the DRLs should also illuminate the tails.  People in snow and fog during the day drive around with with DRLs but you can’t see the rear of the car.  I usually just cover the sensor in low light daytime to turn the lights on instead of using the switch.  Then I don’t worry about turning them off again.OK…it looks like I used the wrong term.  Being a 2002 Miata driver, without any automatic lights of any type, I wasn’t familiar with DRL vs. automatic lights.  So it seems that what I am referring to is DRL’s.  That said…let me ask this…if DRL’s are on and it gets dark, the end result is what I’m describing, correct?  The headlights and dash lights are on, but no taillights.  So what would be the best way to avoid this scenario?  It just seems like the technology should be there to somehow warn the driver that they are driving without taillights or something?
Thanks all for the response!DRLs are there so other drivers see you. They’re not there to help you see anything. The instrument cluster on some cars is set deep in the dash or illuminated at all times to allow you to see the gauges. You’ll notice that most likely the heater/ac controls or radio aren’t illuminated any differently until you turn the headlamps on. There’s your first indication. The second (I believe) is the warning light in the instrument cluster (usually a green bulb symbol) telling you the DRLs are on and the regular exterior lights aren’t.
I’m generally opposed to safety devices in general, so my opinion doesn’t weigh heavily, but I wonder what the exact benefit of DRLs are.All of my cars that have had automatic lights have to be selected into that mode with a switch.
If you put it into that mode but someone else de-selected it (like your toddler) then you may believe they are enabled but not know they aren’t. This isn’t exclusive to automatic headlamps. I have seen many people over the years going down the road with just their DRLs on thinking their headlamps/tail lamps were on. If you want to rail against something, rail against DRLs. They precipitate the problem because some people can’t tell the difference in intensity until it gets much darker out. Prior to DRLs, the incidence of this kind of problem was a much more rare event.There are DRL’s - Daytime Running Lights and there is Automatic Lights (GM’s Twilight Sentinel). They are different!
DRL’s are low power headlights (wired in series) turned on whenever the car is running and the lights are OFF. Turning the running lights ON, lights the tail lights as well as full power (now connected in parallel) headlights. GM realized early on that people were running around at night with just the DRLs on thinking that ALL lights were on. They made Automatic Headlights standard. Ford didn’t. Many other car makers didn’t. So now we have tail light-less people roaming around after dark.
FWIW, I HATE DRLs and disable them on all my cars that have them. They take away the safety of motorcyclists running with their headlights on by confusing motorists. My bike gets lost in the light pollution of these things. It is a BAD idea that should be stopped.FWIW, I HATE DRLs and disable them on all my cars that have them.
I guess you live in a state the doesn’t have laws on this. In many states you it’s against the law to disable them.@MikeInNH, I do not know if my state has a law against disabling DRL’s and frankly, I don’t care. I’m taking a stand. My Automatic Headlights illuminate the dark, I always turn on my lights in the rain and when wipers are on (an unknown, unenforced law in my state) but I will not add to the light pollution and confusion caused by DRL’s. It is illegal to run with high beams on (or pulsing) in traffic but many motorcyclists do this in my state because of DRL’s.I agree with you about DRL. Wife has them on her Lexus. I see no need for them.",,,,
567,Car Acquisition advice for my daughter,General Discussion,20,698,"Background: My daughter went to college in NYC 2002, and continued to live there after graduation. She had no need of a car there. Then, she eventually got married and moved abroad, where she also didn’t need a car. She and her husband are now moving to Seattle, and she asked my advice on getting a car.  I’m planning to send the advice below. Curious about what everyone thinks about my advice.
Thoughts on cars
From a broad-brush perspective, what I like, don’t like, and why:
I no longer have any love for American car brands.  Chrysler, since their “merger” with (acquisition by) Fiat, is building junk. Fiat has always had the lowest quality reputation in the industry, and it has infected Chrysler.  Ford’s quality and reliability has slipped greatly in the last few years.  The only noteworthy product they have now is the Lincoln Continental.  General Motors, while better than a few years ago, is not great.  Buick is the only one of their brands that has decent reliability, per Consumer Reports. European brands (VW, Volvo, Audi, BMW, Mercedes) do not have good reliability ratings, and demand a very high level of very expensive maintenance.  That leaves the Asian Brands:
Toyota and Lexus: Produces the highest quality cars in the industry. Everyone has figured that out, so the prices (new and used) are high for what you get.
Nissan and Infinity:  Formerly good cars.  Their build quality and reliability have slipped badly, particularly in the case of their automatic transmissions.
Honda and Acura: Formerly Great. Reliability has also gone downhill lately.
Hyundai and Kia: I’m very high on Hyundai right now (not so much Kia).  Their design quality has impressed me, their build quality has been perfect, and I can sum up my thoughts in the Sonata review I sent into Hyundai, “As good as a Camry for $10,000 less. Take a look at https://www.hyundaiusa.com/us/en to see what is out there. To get all the safety stuff like Mom has, you would need to get the “Limited” trim line on any of the vehicles.
Auto Insurance- To get an idea of what the cost would be, check AAA.com on the web.  AAA of Washington has a very good insurance department.
As you know, Mom leases a new car every three years. This is to ensure her car is always covered by the new car “bumper to bumper” warranty, and thus we have no maintenance expenses other than routine oil changes. You’ll always have a lease payment, but never any unbudgeted maintenance costs.  You’ll need the following lines in the transportation category of your budget: Lease Payment, Gasoline, Insurance, Maintenance, Registration, Uber or Lyft ( for when you want to leave the driving to someone else). When deciding which car to get, you do not need 4 wheel drive. It adds weight, cost, complexity, and thus, unreliability. You won’t get much snow in seattle, and if you should, you can both work from home. Just find something you’re comfortable in, that can accommodate you, your husband, and my granddaughter comfortably.Very good advice.
Just find something you’re comfortable in, that can accommodate you, your husband, and my granddaughter comfortably.

I can definitely agree  with that advice. However when it comes to used cars, I have to disagree with everything you mentioned before giving that advice. Sure much of it is true, for example you can’t go wrong with most Toyota cars. Yes you may pay a little more but remember they retain their value better than almost every other manufacturer.
No matter what you may have read in regard to value, reliability, maintenance, etc. when it comes to buying a used car just remember, It will always be a case by case situation. There are good Toyota’s and there are bad ones as well.
I find that when buying used cars, to me it’s just as important from whom I purchase from. But that’s just me.
Either way, hope everything works out fine in Seattle and you get to see your granddaughter soon. All the best…Just a note… Kia and Hyundai are essentially the same company. Much like Chevy and Buick. Parts are shared, engineering is done mostly by the same people and the differences are to create the brand differences. If the cars are maintained at least, if not better than manufacturer’s recommendations they seem pretty reliable.
I understand the rationale behind leasing and I’ve done it a few times but I would not recommend someone get on that merry go round. It assumes stability in your finances, work and personal situation for 3 or 4 years. Not every one has that situation.Were talking only new cars here.Fortunately, she’s got that stability.Your thought is very good. We leased for a while, but now own. I retired and we wanted to travel, and now have 2 cars and no travel plans except to the cabins due to covid. Have a 2017 rav4 and 2017 acadia limited for boat towing. Leasing is a good option, as long as mileage will not be a concern. Had our 2003 windstar, total cost over 11 years was $218 a month, leased an Optima for $206 a month, so with no major repairs leasing as can be feared with a purchased car.The general rules are fine, but it also varies from model to model and yr to yr. Hyundai and Kia have some serious issues with their Theta II engines. But they are good value. I own two Hyundai’s.
If buying used, what is available is also an issue. Right now I am shopping for a used 2017+ Tucson but inventory is very low. Since our teens are going to drive the car too, wife wants blind spot monitoring and rear cross traffic alert. This really limits my choices. The Nissan Rogue has these standard since 2018 and the used inventory is much better and better priced than the Hyundai, so I might bite the bullet on the CVT and get a Rogue and just maintain the CVT and keep my fingers crossed.
I also had a 2018 RAV4 that had some driveability issues, so you can get a bad Toyota too.
My point is, it is not always that simple.True, but I only get new and so will she. If she gets one she doesn’t like, she’s only stuck with it for three yearsWe bought out the lease on our 2017 rav4, 18k, used ones had a 22k to 24k price range for 18k miles, made it simple no brainer for me. So if you like it well enough, hopefully the price can turn out better. It was 32k list, paid 11k in lease so it did not work out too bad for me. Yes If we hated it it would be nice to be done with it. Her Kia got rear ended 2 months into the lease, $2200 in damages, was not a problem turning it in at the end of lease but could have been a problem if we owned it and tried to sell it. Don’t forget gap insurance if you lease! $5 a month I think.


 old_mopar_guy:

The only noteworthy product they have now is the Lincoln Continental.


They don’t make that anymore. 2020 was the last year for the Continental. It was sort of a baffling decision to even put it in production in the first place as the MKZ was nearly mechanically identical and even looked similar.



 old_mopar_guy:

When deciding which car to get, you do not need 4 wheel drive. It adds weight, cost, complexity, and thus, unreliability.


I’ve had several 4WD vehicles (all trucks or truck-based SUV’s) and have never had to shell out any money for 4WD-speciific repairs.  I also kept them for either 15 year or 250k miles. 4WD is one of those things that you don’t need 99% of the time, but the times you do need it, it’s invaluable.  Incidentally my dad (who grew up in the mountains of central Pennsylvania) has also held the opinion that 4WD is something that “you don’t need”.  Despite the fact that the last two times we’ve had significant (by central VA standards) snow and the roads typically don’t get cleared until 3 days in or so.  That me and my 4WD truck have had to drop off groceries at his house because his sedan doesn’t have the ground clearance to make it more than a few feet from where he parked it and his 2WD truck (which is kept beside his garage in the back yard) just spins a wheel (open diff) on the snow-covered grass.  If you live in an urban area where the city keeps the roads clear during inclement weather,  then you can probably get by without it. But if you live out beyond the suburbs where your roads aren’t high on the priority list, then I’d definitely consider it.
If I were giving someone advice on buying “a car”. Particularly someone who doesn’t really care much about cars and just wants something reliable that’s easy to live with. My list would go something like this (new cars).

Toyota Corolla
Toyota Camry
Toyota Avalon
Subaru Impreza/Legacy/Outback
Mazda 3
Mazda 6
Gap insurance, plus “wear and tear insurance” costs me $11 a month on my wife’s Hyundai.A 2020 Lincoln Continental starts at 46500.00 .  I have driven one and I just don’t see the value there .  You can find lots of vehicles that are more practical for a lot less money .  Besides it is not that attractive .I think you should add Mazda to the list. They’ve been getting good reviews lately.
As for leasing, I think to be impartial you need to point out that the unbudgeted maintenance costs that you’re worried about are likely to be lower than the higher cost of leasing, although of course this isn’t guaranteed.If you are worries about maintenance costs, why would you get rid of a Kia Or Hyundai after 3 years when they are warrantied bumper to bumper for   5 years or  60,000 miles?  If you drive over 12,000 miles a year, you have no business leasing a car.
I personally don’t think any one should lease a car, but then, unlike mopar guy, I don’t like changing cars.  If it was not for rust, I would probably be driving my 66 Valiant. Changing cars every three years as the most expensive way to go eiyjer leasing or buying. Makes sense only if you are using your car to impress someone.Good advice except you’ve forgotten the “demographic and emotional” side of the equation.
Most young families prefer a SUV (today’s station wagon) for the ease of entry, size (strollers, diaper bags, etc.) and image, “It’s outdoorsy and everyone else drives one”.
Further, considered the intended use (grocery store runs, kid hauling, sippy cup drops, etc.) I’d imagine that in 3 years it’s going to be in less than pristine condition so I’d eliminate leasing to avoid getting nailed at turn back time.
So unless you enjoy talking to a brick wall I’d limit my suggestions to SUVs, try to get them to focus on the long term operating costs and insist that they purchase gap insurance.Well, my daughter did her research and narrowed the choices down to a Honda Pilot or hyundai palisade. I got her to promise not to commit to anything until she’s moved, and can rent each of those SUV’s for a week.You are a tough master. My daughter liked the KIA soul, I said fine and cosigned the loan. Seemed to be an ok car. Still doing well 3 years later. Paid it off after year 1, bugging her at 70k to do a trans service.My daughter bought a 2020 Pilot and is very happy with it. Don’t buy a 2019 leftover if there are any. It uses the 9 speed transmission. Starting in 2020, there is a 10 speed. The 9 speed had a lot of problems and Honda accelerated replacement because of that.She’d get a 2021.",,,,

Also check the carpet on the firewall to see if the water is coming in from the windshield or through the firewall.

572,2012 Subaru Outback - Dash lights lit up,Maintenance/Repairs,4,192,"All of my dashboard lights including check engine, brake, skid, etc. are on and flashing. What causes this and is it harmful to drive the car? I can’t get it into the shop until next week.This could be an alternator issue, grounding problem or the battery terminals could be corroded and losing contact off and on. As for driving it, as long as your gauges are where they normally are it should be ok but you may end up stranded without power if the alternator isn’t charging your battery as you drive.Yes, this could harm the car. You should not keep driving this car until it is checked out.Because so many people seem to think that it is “normal” for a Check Engine Light (CEL) to be lit-up, ever since 2010 Subaru has programmed their vehicles so that all of the warning lights will be activated if the CEL turns on.  Ergo–much more difficult to ignore many warning lights.
That being said, if these lights were on steadily, rather than flashing, it might be a relatively benign problem.  Once they are flashing, it indicates that the vehicle should be towed to a qualified mechanic, rather than driving it.The BCM may be bad.

wandering if I will have continues problems


Wondering if you will continue to have problems .   No one can answer that question . The shop doing the work might be able to guess the overall condition of the vehicle .  It is just a fact that used vehicles can have problems .Ouch! At least you got 6 months before this happened which means the previous owner didn’t intentionally sell you his headache.
I hope whatever shop is doing the work knows what they’re doing and not unintentionally running up a bill throwing parts at the problem. Usually a battery dying is just a bad alternator or regulator or some light being left on. Seems odd that a dash cluster would have a continuous draw.

Not odd at all. Instrument panels are computers and not just a bunch of gauges.

If anybody has any ideas for me to try and hopefully diagnose my problem it would be greatly appreciated.Have you checked the serpentine belt for wear?
TesterCheck all grounds
Check all wire connections to and from alternator and batteryI suggest you check for a voltage drop on the main cable to the battery. Place your meter probes on the main output lead of the alternator and the positive battery post while the blower and lights are on high and the engine running around 1500 RPM. You should have less than .3 volts of voltage drop if the connection is in good shape. If that is good then check the main ground wire the same way except use the negative post for that test. Check the chassis/battery ground. If haven’t already cleaned the battery connections so they are spotless you should do that.Thank you guys so much for your help. I replaced the alternator plug as well as the belt and the problem is fixed. You guys are awesome!",,,,

582,Standard Practice for Replacing Brake Lines,Maintenance/Repairs,27,16.4k,"Alrighty, a week ago I lost all breaking pressure suddenly while driving. I wasn’t far from home and got the rest of the way back slowly and used the emergency brake to stop. I had my car towed and taken to a repair shop. All they told me was that the rear brake line was out and they were replacing it. I was charged on my invoice for a brake line, brake line nut, and brake fluid.
I suddenly lost pressure again while driving. It happened fast. It was fine one minute then a minute later no brake pressure. Pumping the brake didn’t return the pressure. I was lucky to be able to pull over. Called the same towing/repair place (only one in my town) to come get it. When the towing guys got there I popped my hood and had them show me where the brake fluid was. It was pretty empty. The other guy hit the pedal and commented that it must be spewing fluid somewhere.
I asked them how this same thing I got fixed happen again in a week. If one brake line was bad how come the others weren’t checked. The response I got was as follows:
#1- Brake lines corrode from the inside out and you can’t tell by looking at it when it’s bad. All brakes will get bad eventually because brake fluid is acidic.
(this seems problematic from a logical safety standpoint.)
#2- when you replace one brake line the others can go because of pressure change and imbalance.
(So then why isn’t it standard procedure to replace all lines at once?)
I also read elsewhere that if any brake lines show signs of decay its a good idea to replace all brake hoses since they deteriorate at the same rate inside and out and that’s a good tell tell sign.
So am i getting dicked around by shoddy mechanics? What is the standard when it comes to brake line replacement?Brake lines can rot from the inside if the fluid is not changed on a regular basis as it should be or rust from the outside due to road salt, age, etc.
The reason for hesitancy about replacing everything at once is that mechanics are quite frequently accused of gouging and piling on.
For every customer who agrees with the notion of one bad/they’re all bad there are many more who will accuse the shop of gouging by recommending they all be replaced.
There is no standard. My opinion is that if one line is in bad shape the customer should be advised they all need replacement and that puts the ball on the customer’s side of the court.
This then leads to the point of brake lines being badly corroded to the point of failure and other parts which are likely on the edge. That would include master cylinders, wheel cylinders, and brake calipers.
Tell the customer they need all the lines, MC, WCs, and calipers and watch the accusations fly…It would help if we knew what you were driving.  Our brake lines around here always rust from the outside in.  Unless your car is very, very old I cannot imagine a brake line rusting from the inside.
It sounds to me that your shop will come up with any story that sounds good to convince you that nothing is their fault.I suppose when it comes to brakes and the safety involved I’d rather a mechanic be upfront about everything. If there’s a logical reason to replace all that then I will and avoid paying for it latter. I just wish it was mentioned that there was more that might have needed repaired. I just got this car used from a reputable dealer 6 months ago.it’s only a 2002 Haundai Sonata without even 100,000 miles yet. I am in the northeast thoughEach brake line “lives” in a different environment.  You were the victim of bad luck, not a shoddy mechanic IMHO.At 13 years old in the northeast you can expect brake lines to start rusting out. It’s much more a time issue than a mileage issue.The better question is, “what is the standard for brake fluid replacement?” Most car makers recommend replacing the brake fluid every 2-3 years. Most owners ignore this recommendation, and as a result, brake fluid slowly absorbs moisture from the air and causes corrosion inside the brake lines. If your shop tested your brake fluid they would likely find it contains a high percentage of water from not being changed in the life of the car, I’d guess.
Your mechanic is not the problem. He was being cautious in not trying to replace too many parts and being accused of gouging.
The problem is you and/or previous owners not changing the brake fluid every 2-3 years as recommended by the manufacturer (check your owners manual).Since I haven’t had the car for a year I know it’s probably just dumb luck. I suppose I assumed too much when I thought the dealership handled everything about making the car up to snuff for passing the PA inspection and sale. I just wish the mechanic was honest and up front about what could happen and what might need done and let me decide as someone else pointed out earlier. It’s honest and avoids gouge accusationsBrake lines are mostly metal, with a section of rubber hose at each wheel.  The rubber section is needed to allow for the up and down movement of the suspension.  Most often it is a rubber section that fails.  The metal tube section last a lot longer.  Was you brake line failure at a fitting?  In a rubber section?  Or, in the metal tubing?
If one of the rubber sections failed, then other rubber sections are likely in similar bad shape.  The metal lines hold up OK if you change the brake fluid every 3 to 4 years.  If you never changed the brake fluid after 13 years the fluid likely has become polluted with water, and that water can rust the metal lines from the inside out.
More info about the specifics of what failed and where would get a better answer about what to do now.Those are very good questions for me to ask the mechanic. As I said the ONLY thing they told me was my rear break line was out the first time. I had to send it back to the same mechanic. Hopefully they’ll tell me straight what went wrong. Sometimes it’s about knowing what to ask. I’ll also talk to them and tell them to let me know ALL the details of everything that COULD be wrong so they don’t have to worry that I’ll accuse them of gouging. The shop’s not open til monday and they didn’t have time to get a look at it today.The problem for your mechanic is that all the corrosion is happening inside the brake lines where it’s invisible and impossible to inspect. All they can do is replace components. It’s your choice as to whether to pre-emptively replace parts that haven’t failed yet.
Since your mechanic used the word “corrosion,” I’m assuming that what failed was a metal brake line, not a rubber nose, since rubber doesn’t corrode.
Unfortunately no one can predict when a brake line will fail. It’s not the fault of your mechanics. But since you apparently have had two consecutive metal brake line failures (but be sure to confirm this with your mechanic first), I would have all other metal brake lines replaced, and all old brake fluid flushed and replaced with new fluid.I’m puzzled on how the OP can lose all brake pressure.  If a brake line begins leaking, then the car will lose only half the braking.
Sure the pedal travel will be farther to the floor and more pressure will need to be applied.  But it should not be the complete loss of braking the OP mentions.I have found that sometimes the “dual-braking” systems don’t really work that well.  On one car, when bleeding one caliper, the brake pedal always went to the floor.  I remember thinking, “Oh well, so much for the ‘dual-brakes’ myth.”Me too insightful, I never understood that.  The dual system is supposed to eliminate the total failure (I thought) but I’ve bled the brakes on my old Accord probably 50 times, same thing every time, just like you said.  Hmmmm.   RocketmanI just got done with the exact same problem with someones car. I replaced the line that went from the ABS actuator to the rear tee. The two lines from the tee to each rear wheel looked ok so I left them be.
When I went to vacuum bleed the brakes I kept getting a lot of air. I hopped in and pumped the brakes a few times and looked under the car. I had a gusher in the front left. I guess while I was replacing the rear main line, I had bumped a front line and caused a weak area to fracture without knowing it. I ended up replacing both front lines next.
The problem also is that many times these lines are hidden under or behind other parts and cannot be inspected. So the best a mechanic can do is to fix whatever is the problem at hand and try his best to inspect the rest.
As far as a mechanic being required to inspect and warn you of any impending doom. He’d have to advise you to replace the entire car. Because at some point something else will go wrong.
The OP only had the car for 6 months and the lines would have shown rusting at that point, but like I said …much is hidden from sight.
YosemiteEngineers love to design things to make them everything but easy to work on.  All automotive engineering students should have to spend an internship working in a garage.       RocketmanAgreed!!!
YosemiteNo sense getting all worked up yet, you don’t even know what the problem is. It could be the same line they “repaired” and it failed again. Imagine that. That would be far more concerning to me than another one leaking. These guys aren’t carnac the magnificent. As many have already said, few people want them to proactively fix at any cost even for something as critical as brakes. You tell them you want no failures, you better brace yourself for the ensuing bill. Because if one failed, the rest are surely not far behind…One line to the rear of my 1999 Honda Civic rusted through last winter. Two brake lines and two fuel lines run close and parallel from the firewall to near the gas tank; the whole bundle has a perforated plastic cover protecting things from flying debris. This cover, however, traps snow and ice and salt, etc. The repair shop said the least expensive way is to just run a new line outside that cover, but I decided to have them remove the cover for a closer look-see and to replace both rear brake lines. This came to about $350.

My Chrysler van had a loose connection there that caused the right channel of the sound system to not function.

I decided to check things out myself and pushed in the connector that was inside the door jam. The shop spent many hours, and replaced things needlessly, trying to solve a simple wire connection issue.As others have said check the wiring first.

image600×600 41.7 KB
Ignition control modules function in two modes.
These are the start and run modes.
When starting the engine, the module allows full battery voltage to the coil to ensure a cold engine has a hot enough spark to start,
When the ignition switch goes to the run position, the module switches to the run mode.
The module then drops the voltage to the coil so when the charging system comes on line when the engine starts, the higher voltage doesn’t fry the secondary ignition components.
So, the module may be working during the start mode, but failing in the run mode.

588,AC randomly turns on,Maintenance/Repairs,6,188,"Hi, everyone. I went to a well known shop yesterday to have brake pads replaced. They replaced the pads, but now my AC is randomly turning on by itself while I’m driving. It happened about 5 times on the way to work this morning. It’s never happened before. Any ideas of what they may have done?I have to think that this is a random malfunction, as brake work should have no effect on your HVAC system.    Certain Chrysler models have known problems with their Body Control Module, so it is possible that your BCM has gone fluky.Totally agree brake work is completely independent of this issue, but is it possible they left something open or anything else while doing the inspection? They inspect for everything: air filters, fluids, wipers, etc, etc.Call the shop and ask them if they might have caused this problem . The worst they can do is say no. They might even do a good will gesture and look at your vehicle.


 amarayyash:

It happened about 5 times on the way to work this morning.


Is it the first time using windshield defroster this year ?


 amarayyash:

is it possible they left something open


Unless they opened the control panel for the HVAC system, or tampered with the BCM, there is nothing that they could have left “open” that would explain the situation.    And–trust me–they didn’t do either of those things.
But, a return visit to this shop would be a good idea, just to clarify the situation for you.Most cars turn the AC on and off automatically when the air flow settings are in certain positions.  Did they change a setting to a position you don’t use?
Another caution: watch out if this shop is too eager to do a major fix on your system. They might have disconnected something intentionally.",,,,

592,2001 Ford F250 - Electronic module issue,Maintenance/Repairs,2,188,"The General Electronics Module on my 2001 Ford F-250 has failed.  It operates the door locks and the door ajar light.  It worked perfectly fine before dropping my truck off for a complete paint job.  During the paint work, all 4 door latch mechanisms were removed and re-installed.  The door ajar light is always since I picked up the truck a few days ago.  The right read door lock also would not function from the outside.  The body shop looked into it and found that both rear door had a part that was re-installed upside down.  They corrected that and the latches now work properly, but they could not fix the door ajar light issue.  They sent it over to service and they determined the General Electric Module had failed.
Question:  Could the improper installation of the door latches cause any kind of short circuit that would fry the module?  The quote to repair even with a discount is $550.    I can’t understand how a module would failed while sitting in a body shop for 3 weeks.Normally shorts are protected internally to electronic controllers but… not always.
I think the evidence is fairly clear that the body shop whacked the module.
But it IS a 19 year old truck so if they pay half of it, I’d say take it and move on.The latches have very tiny and somewhat delicate switches in them which control the door ajar light and I suspect the problem is with the latch instead of the module. Yes they can be hit and miss and if they installed parts upside down in both doors I might tend to take their diagnosis with a grain of salt.

598,Shock problems after new brake pads?,Maintenance/Repairs,7,2.8k,"I took my '02 Hyundai Elantra (84k mi) in to replace brake pads. When I got it back, I was bouncing down the road.  Every bump sent me oscillating like a slinky, and it seems to be mostly driven from front left tire. I found they had filled tires to 40psi, which I promptly reduced to 32, but found the problem persisting.

 I attempted the ‘bounce test’ and couldn’t really even get the front end to move appreciably to see if it continued oscillating. Back end worked fine, just as described, with only 1-2 cycles before resting.

 I assume it’s the shocks going out, but what are the odds of it coinciding w/ brake service like that? Service dept. said there was nothing they did that could have caused it. Don’t know what they could have done, but just seems too coincidental for comfort. Is 84k miles good/bad/avg for replacement of shocks/struts? Is there anything they could have done to cause this?When they did the brake service, they put the vehicle on a lift. When they lifted the vehicle it allowed the susprnsion to hang, hyper-extending the struts. If the valving in the struts is marginal from normal wear, lifting the vehicle can show how worn the valving is and you end up with a ride that’s not as stable.
If the struts are good and you lift a vehicle this doesn’t happen. But if the struts have miles on them, lifting the vehicle can reveal how worn the struts are. So don’t go back blaming those who did the brake job. They did nothing wrong.
TesterAbout the only thing they could easily screw up that might produce your handling problems would be to forget to tighten the wheel lug nuts.  Not very likely, but worth checking because loose lug nuts will probably get looser, a brake rotor may wobble and end up warping, and a wheel might eventually come off.Thank you for the prompt and thorough response.  I’m guessing my prognosis is another service job, this time focused on the suspension…I’ve just had the same problem. Same model car 02 elantra. Got brakes changed yesterday. Now the car is driving like a bouncy castle. Last thing I need at the moment is to have to buy new struts. I’m guessing the old vulve on the struts didn’t like being extended. B

I think that your options at this point are limited to either replacing the struts or tolerating the suspension problem.

The engine had weird studs for some of the mains and I had to use a wrench and hammer to try and get the same amount of torque on them as the rest of the mains. Could the chain gotten loose from when the bolts got loose and let the old cam move back and forth? And then could that be making a knocking noise? I just really don’t want to pull the engine for a 3rd time. Thanks in advance for the help.
Some other things to note are that it does get faster with more revs however it doesn’t seem to get much louder. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I just really really don’t want to have to pull the engine for a 3rd time. Thank youDo you mean that you disassembler and                   re-assembled an engine without a torque wrench?No I used a torque wrench on everything but the studs that I couldn’t figure out, the hold the windage tray or whatever it would be called. I did my best and just counted turns and went by feel. I know that isn’t the correct way to do itI don’t think I can help you, maybe one of the pro mechanics whp hang out here can.
I do admire your ambition at 16 though.The farthest bearings from the oil pump are… in front. I’d suggest you have a rod knock.
Did you remove the main and rod caps at the front? Did you see any problems with the bearing shells on those? Did you measure the oil clearance? If not, you should.
It can also be a cracked piston. Higher pitched tapping sound that sounds like a rod bearing is just starting to fail.
In the future, those main cap studs can be tightened with a deep socket or a crows foot wrench that fits your torque wrench.Thanks, it’s a nice excuse for when I mess things upI think you’re right about the rod knock. When I took everything apart it looked fine and I I’ll check the clearance. I thought about it and I’m pretty sure it’s going to be number 3 or which ever main has the studs I didn’t properly torque. I’ll make sure to find a deeper socket, thanksYou rebuilt motor? Remaned crank, new rod bearings? Why do u think it’s rod knock?I didn’t properly torque 3 bolts on the mains, it had these studs that holds the windage tray or whatever that little tray was and I didn’t have a socket that could reach them, so I did the lazy and wrong thing and tried to “torque” them by counting turns and feel. Good idea at the time in my head but now I’m not so sure.Well, you are not stupid. Ignorant maybe but that only means lack of knowledge. We all are guilty of that to some degree and that includes myself.
Try pushing the crankshaft back and forth lengthwise to see if there is any excessive crank end play that has cropped up for whatever reason. That could lead to noise in the cover or echo noise if torque converter bolts are hitting.
What about the oil slinger on the crankshaft?
In 87 Chevy had carbed, TBI, and fuel injection engines. Which is yours? If carbed, maybe an issue with the mechanical fuel pump push rod, pump itself, or pump eccentric?
I can think of a lot of things to go wrong and the above is only a small slice of them.Ok I’ll look at the things you said to check. It has a carb but it has an inline electric fuel pump, the block doesn’t even have provisions for a mechanical fuel pump. It also is a manual but I’m guessing that the rear bolt noise applies the same? It’ll probably take me a while to get the pan off but when I do I’ll be sure to check. The great engine placement of the Firebird makes it so the whole engine has to be lifted at least somewhat to get at the pan. Thanks for the ideas.",,,,

601,2014 Ford Edge won’t connect to my phone anymore,Maintenance/Repairs,15,357,"Hi all,  My 'phone was connected OK to my Ford KA Edge 2014 then, suddenly last weekend it tells me no phone is connected.  When I first connected all I did was made my phone bluetooth visible and everything was OK but now my car won’t recognise it.  I’ve tried downloading various  apps to my phone but nothing works as they all seem to want SYNC which my phone doesn’t recognise.Start by trying a different phone. If that one doesn’t work either the problem is with the vehicle. At that point I’d suspect the Bluetooth transponder is failing. Depending on the vehicle it might be in the dash, the center console, built into the radio, or somewhere else completely. A car audio place is a good bet for someone to solve the problem.@Carole25  I had the same problem recently that occurred after software updates on my cell phone.  Per tech support from my phone service I did the following which worked to get my phone recognized by my car and reconnected to the bluetooth by following this sequence:


Double check in your cell phone’s settings that bluetooth function is enabled/turned on.  Sometimes phone software updates disable bluetooth pairing requiring you to turn it back on.


Power off your cell phone for a full minute or more; not just a restart but totally powered off.  Then turn it back on.  Wait a full minute then repeat.  Then repeat for a third time.


Start your car.


Follow the protocol in your car’s manual for how to pair a bluetooth enabled phone to your car.


Hope this works for you.  Good luck.
EDIT: Adding what should be the FIRST step; delete your phone from your car’s memory so that when you go to pair the phone the car is searching for it as if for the first time.
See post #8 for the corrected complete sequence.


 Marnet:

Double check in your cell phone’s settings that bluetooth function is enabled/turned on.


+1
My phone–which is about 5 years old–will turn off Bluetooth if the power reserve of the battery goes below 40%, apparently in some sort of power-saving mode.    I will be buying a new phone w/in a few months, but until then I have learned to check every morning whether Bluetooth is enabled.  If not, then I do a full recharge and then re-start the phone.  That works every time.


 VDCdriver:

My phone–which is about 5 years old–will turn off Bluetooth if the power reserve of the battery goes below 40%, apparently in some sort of power-saving mode.


+1  My previous phone’s battery got where it discharged rapidly but recharged very slowly.  All sorts of things quit working properly.  Turned out the battery was swollen!  First thing that quit working was the bluetooth function.Marnet, thank you but that’s the first thing I checked.@Carole25  Sorry it wasn’t a simple fix on the phone rather than the car.
There are many very experienced, knowledgable contributors here on the forum.  Hopefully their input will help you solve the problem.
Good luck.@Carole25  One more quick note.  The sequence I gave worked one time when the phone setting was still ok, still had bluetooth enabled.  Just rebooting the phone once didn’t work.
I had to go through the entire three reboots of the phone with the car turned off!  Only after the hard reboot of the phone start the car.
When I tried rebooting the phone with car still running it wouldn’t pair.  It required:

delete your car’s memory of the phone (I forgot this first step earlier)
car turned off
phone out and away from the car
three powered off, then powered on hard reboots in sequence of the phone
then start the car
then go through pairing process

*** be sure to have deleted the car’s memory of your phone and have it looking for the phone as if for the first time.  I forgot that in the first set of instructions
This may not work for your situation but I hope it may.  Good luck.  And do keep reading here for the advice on this from other far more knowledgable and experienced contributors have to offer.If you haven’t done this already, unpair the car from your phone and vice versa, then reboot your phone and restart the car, then try the pairing from scratch. If that doesn’t work, tell us exactly what you observe at that point.If all else fails, find a teenager.
But seriously, if you and your tech help can’t get it to work, drop by the dealer’s service department, they should be able to check out whether it’s a phone or a car problem.If all else fails, find a teenager.
That would be the easy way and possibly the best way.My old phone had a bit of confusion a times trying to connect with my 2013 Sync equipped Mustang. My newer phone has no issues at all and connects each and every time.
But my new will not connect to my old BlueTooth headphones…
The multiple generations of the BlueTooth protocols sometimes will not connect to the older versions. And 6 years is a looong time in the computer world. The best I can suggest is to second finding a teenager to fiddle with it.Teenager?  Find a 2-year old. If you hand an unlocked smartphone to my grandson, he’ll find videos to watch. It’s amazing. Kid videos are readily available on the phones he gets access to, but he still has to open the application and do a little navigation to get there.

totally not car related, but be careful about that.  some of the big streaming kids channels don’t monitor what gets posted to their “kids” channels and some of it is amazingly un-kid friendly…

An unnamed kitten seems like a serious situation for the state of Colorado, I hope it doesn’t result in a delay of the election count. 
Around here, there is a vast oversupply of stray cats.  They breed like rats, and since there is no socially-acceptable way to get rid of them, the only thing that helps control their population is the occassional very cold winter.  Needless to say, if I could find a way to reduce the population of stray cats in my neighborhood that isn’t highly illegal, dangerous, or considered cruel, I’d do it.In our city stray cats are spayed or neutered, tagged and returned to help with overpopulation and rodent control.


 bcohen2010:

Most communities have a TNR (trap, neuter, return) program.  These are privately funded so if you feel strongly about it, make a contribution.  There are a lot of rescue groups for stray cats and dogs that will foster, vet and if friendly enough, will transport them to areas where neuter programs have been so successful that their is a shortage of pets at a reasonable price.  These also live off of donations.“Little Mack” apparently didn’t make the cut.  That was my suggestion.",,,,

You need to have this battery checked… Most auto parts stores can do this for free.
Then you need to find out why the battery keeps dying. This requires a check of the alternator output, which you might also get checked for free at the auto parts store…
AND, you may need an actual mechanic (NOT the auto parts store employee) to run a parasitic draw test to find out what might be draining your battery. If you have any non-factory electronics in the car, assume it is one of them you might have to replace.Check your battery terminals for loose connection first .If that doesn’t solve it, do what Mustangman says.Year and miles?2014 105,000

My ES300 did that around 100,000 miles, it turned out the starter solenoid contacts were worn, creating an intermittent start.  This is a common problem with Toyota/Lexus cars around 100,000 miles.  If the battery, cable connections, and cables are good, I’d consider either a replacement starter or replacement starter solenoid contacts.I’d try replacing the starter relay in the fuse box under the hood.

Stop the presses! They could have asked us, saved money on the researchers. But then our university towns would be filled with unemployed scientists, hanging out on our sidewalks, holding ‘Will research for food’ signs.I’m sure I’ll miss something by not going through the 108 pages of fine print, but until there is the Cliff Note version . . .  At any rate like with anything, if there was not a receiver, there would not be a sender and visa versa.  There would be no used cars if no one bought new cars.  Not everyone will want or buy a new car.Strict regs in European countries means perfectly serviceable cars head towards the Balkans and Middle east. Same for Japanese cars heading to New Zealand or Indonesia or Vietnam. Japanese laws are so strict 5 year old cars become too costly to be brought into compliance but they are still serviceable cars.Japanese home market cars have less corrosion protection than the ones sold in the US because their life expectancy is shorter.
The used cars mean a family of 5 gets to ride inside the car instead of hanging off a 90cc motorbike. Safer than a Tik Tuk. It means a man can feed his family because he bought an old truck or car.
The first world’s rehilations means transportation for the 3rd world.Search the origins of the word “Jallopy” and find that there’s a long history of dumping US junk automobiles on Mexico. And these days traveling any route from the Mexican border north will result in seeing a great many pickups being towed south by a similar small pickup. Maybe they’re headed Mexico or beyond and maybe Mexico is a 3rd world country. Certainly some of Mexico is worse off than Cuba and much of South America.In the mid-90’s, I was in central Pennsylvania. I advertised an older Mazda pickup locally, and the buyer told me that she would be shipping it to her family in Ghana.
It is somewhat inflammatory to label these activities as “dumping”.  There are world-wide market forces in action, and every country has its own decisions to make about the wisdom of allowing such imports. Your car with a check engine light on might be far less polluting that the car it will replace.The Caribbean is filled with used vehicles from Japan.
I’ve seen this because my in-laws are in Jamaica.
Makes sense in the former British colonies because they’re right hand drive.This revelation is hardly “news”, and the phenomenon has been going on for many years.
Several decades ago, a friend of mine was having trouble getting rid of his old Maverick, and in desperation he took it to a place that advertised “instant cash for your old car”.  Without even lifting the hood, the owner peeled-off a couple of hundred dollar bills and handed them to my friend.
When I asked him what he did with the cars that he took in, he stated that they were shipped to South America and to Africa.The Big 3 used to send their old tooling to bang out old models in South America.VW made the bus in Brazil and the Beetle in Mexico long after they were dropped in the US and Europe.


 Mustangman:

The Big 3 used to send their old tooling to bang out old models in South America.


Yes, but it wasn’t just the Big Three.  After the Willys Aero sedan was discontinued, Kaiser shipped the tooling to Brazil, where that model was manufactured up to the early '70s.   A couple of restylings actually transformed the old Aero into a reasonably modern looking car!A dealer in the U.S. was to remove the sign but it supposedly was sold to Turkey and ended up in Syria instead.
Mark-1992×558 48 KBNow we don’t know for sure that they weren’t out clearing drains with that thing.  No evidence as they say.I agree and don’t understand why shipping cars to the Third World is a “problem”.
From the recipient’s side it’s an opportunity to get affordable transportation providing access yielding income, educational and health benefits.
From the environmental side, it delays the large environmental costs of scrapping a vehicle (Not everything in a car can be recycled) so generally the best environmental solution is to keep a vehicle until it has been so worn out that it’s no longer repairable or useful.
As the old Yankee saying goes, “Use it up, wear it out, fix it up or do without”

When she arrived (by boat, of course) she found out what real singing was, concluded that she would never get beyond ‘third valkyrie on the left’, went into comedy.

Heh heh heh.  Never thought about a shot gun.  I had a slow stool that I was trying to unclog once.  Ran to Menards and bought one of those uncloggers.  Didn’t fix it.  Looked up the stool model and was about to go to Home Depot to buy a new one out of desperation, then noticed a small white disc in the bottom.  Fished it out and all was well.  The wife had put one of those things in the tank and as it dissolved jammed in the stool.  “Please don’t use those anymore.”  Glad I never thought of the shot gun but that would have fixed it.

Notice? You used the word “dump” and all the negatives that word implies. You used it as the primary descriptive as a judgmental accusation. “US, Europe, dump old cars on 3rd world.”Correct.  They aren’t dumping them, they are selling them.  Maybe for more than Americans are willing to pay.  So what’s the issue.  They can be sold in the US, so why can’t they be sold in another country?   Where do you think your old car went when you sold or traded it in?  It did not vaporize, so either it was recycled or it was sold elsewhere or it was crushed and piled in a hole somewhere.  Here we sit, a country of the first buyers of consumer products, being horrified that the things we no longer want are being exported to other countries.  Really?I’ve spent some time in South America for work. Believe it or not…many people down there want our old cars. Mainly from the 60-s through early 80’s.

And, the same could be said about Advance Auto.
A couple of years ago, my Auto Zone battery’s warranty was almost up, so–just to play it safe–I went there for a free battery check about 2 weeks before the warranty would have expired.   Within less than 5 minutes, one of their guys came out to test my battery, and the meter read “FAIL”.   He said to give him a few minutes, and–sure  enough–in less than 5 minutes he was back with a brand-new comparable battery, which I received without cost.
I tried to give the Auto Zone guy a few bucks for his prompt and courteous service, but he declined it.
He said he would appreciate it if I would give him a positive rating on their website, so as soon as I returned home, I did just that.On a three year old car the battery should not  “normally”  be shot .   Also in modern cars if you leave any lights whether interior or headlights the BCM  will shut these off automatically  within like 20  minutes if the car is not running so I’m not sure what the problem would be if the battery does not fix it  .You might need the dealer to do a computer reflash or software upgrade.",,,,

Mending an old belt ?  That has to be a joke .Try “teeth counting” method: the number of teeth between the center mark and camshaft marks is well known and easy to lookup over internet.
I used to have 2.2L subaru where I had similar 1-tooth misalignment and although engine ran, it had unstable idle.
mark looked similar to yours: hard to tell if this is 1 tooth off or not.
I used a sharpie to put a mark every 10 teeth to make it easier and in few minutes I had the suspicion confirmed, it was indeed 1 off.
Easy fix.

Mending an old belt ? That has to be a joke .


We can only hope…
But, some people are incredibly… thrifty.
My oldest friend from my undergraduate days makes it his business to “shop” in peoples’ garbage cans once each week for what he terms “treasures”.  For quite a while, his Dentist had been urging him to buy a Waterpik device, but he balked at the “excessive” price.   Finally, he found one in somebody’s garbage can, and started to use it.  Within a week or so he had a raging fungal infection in his mouth.
He also “washes” his dishes by rinsing them with cold water, and the result is that several times each year he has to pay a plumber to clear the drain of the congealed grease that results from his “money-saving” method of cleaning his dishes.
I keep telling him that he can’t afford to “save money” the way that he does, but he just continues to shoot himself in the foot with his penny-pinching ways.   And, because I help him with his income tax return, I know that he doesn’t need to live like a rag picker.

I guess the last person to do the timing belt did. I’m just going by the stamped lines which is what I assume I’m supposed to do. The repair manual says to line the stamped lines up at least.
I’m not sure what the arrow on the crankshaft pulley is (that’s pointing right) but the white mark at the top is white paint over the stamped line (there’s another stamped line on the rear of the sprocket in the same position too). As far as the link that should take you to imgur where I posted the other pics. I just clicked it and it seems to work.

The national average is 13,500 miles a year. https://www.caranddriver.com/research/a32880477/average-mileage-per-year/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Department%20of%20Transportation’s,over%201000%20miles%20every%20month. For a 10 year old Escape that works out to 135,000 miles. 186,000 is about 51,000 more than average or about twice around the world. Still, it depends on how those miles were accumulated. A good independent mechanic can inspect the vehicle if you choose and tell you what shape it’s in.Yes, that is a lot of miles on the odometer, which means that you have to be prepared for inevitable repairs, some of which could be very pricey.  However, you can improve your odds by inspecting the maintenance records of the vehicle.
For instance, when was the transmission fluid last changed?    If the answer is “never”, or “not within the past 3 years”, then with that type of odometer mileage, you will be paying for a transmission overhaul in the near future.   This would likely cost $2k, or more.
How often has the oil been changed, in terms of both odometer mileage and elapsed time?
If the previous owner(s) were not conscientious about oil changes, there could be engine problems on the horizon.
And, as was already stated, an inspection by your mechanic can help you to avoid buying something that will explode your wallet with repair costs.Agreed with all the advice to have a mechanic inspect the vehicle.
You might also get a Carfax for the vehicle. I know some of the information can be limited, but I’ve found you can learn at least something about the vehicle from the Carfax data. For example, if the mileage listed between oil changes is high, you might assume the car was used for commuting. If so, those are “easy” miles on a car.
For what it’s worth, I’ve bought (2) “higher mileage” cars like this, and have had no unusual issues with them. But, I studied the Carfaxes for both cars closely before I decided to purchase.
Good luck.",,,,

I was wondering if I could avail of another insurance company’s services for my wife’s car rather than the old one as I came across an auto insurance offering excellent additional coverage and affordable premium rates. But as I am not familiar with it, I need some help. Could someone help and advise me if you have two different insurance companies for their cars?The chance of someone having two different insurance carriers is really low .  Seriously if you don’t like yours then move all of yours to one company because that is how you get discounts .
A web search will get you ratings on most companies and ask relatives , friends or coworkers how their insurance has treated them.How is your current insurance “not satisfactory”?
In my opinion both you and your wife should be on both policies for both cars.  Have you talked to your home/rental insurance agent?


 VOLVO-V70:

The chance of someone having two different insurance carriers is really low . Seriously if you don’t like yours then move all of yours to one company because that is how you get discounts .


I concur. By having different carriers you miss out on multi-car discounts and also having bundle packages that include a home. If you think you can get a cheaper rate for your wife with another company then chances are you both can benefit.
I NEVER EVER shop for the cheapest rates. I shop for coverage. Not all insurance coverage’s are the same. How well an insurance company handles a claim is far more important then how cheap they are. If you know any auto-body shops ask them if there are any insurance companies that they have problems with. What ones they avoid.Is it possible the OP is a shill for the insurance website they posted?

If so, it sounds like the switch is bad.Thank you for your quick response Dave. What switch are you referring to?

 d5rile:

As you may know, newer cars don’t use a door jam switch like older ones so I having trouble finding the mechanism that tells the car that the door is open or shut


I dunno about “newer” cars because my Corolla is the same year as your Volvo and it has door jamb switches. It might be a Volvo thing. Still, it’s just common sense that there has to be a switch somewhere that tells the car the door is open. There’s probably one inside the door if you can’t find it in any obvious location, possibly integrated with the latch.Hi Dave, with all my digging around looking for a definitive answer, the absence of a door jam switch does point to the Latch and makes the most sense. However i can’t get anyone or any article to tell me that the latch is the answer. Thank you for your input so far.It looks like you’re going to have to bite the bullet and take it to a dealer or an independent shop that knows Volvo’s. The switch might not even be the problem but it’s likely IMHO.First off, let me qualify my answer by saying that I am not a late model Volvo expert and I do not have any late model wiring schematics for reference. My answer is based on dealing with similar problems in other cars.
Odds are the door will have to be gone into as Volvo likely uses some small switches in the handle and/or door latch assembly and one of them has failed. These  can sometimes be a pain to deal with due to limited access. The switches are generally small, somewhat delicate, and it generally means replacement of the handle or latch assembly.
I had this problem surface on my Lincoln about 6 yeara ago. I managed to fix it but did not expect it to last. I got 5ish years out of it before it boogered up again and the message center is now showing “Door Ajar” again even though it is closed. Changing the handle assembly on the Lincoln is a nightmare and I just have not rounded up enough incentive and red blood cells to have at it again.
To make things worse, I think the switches on my Sonoma truck are messing up as of a week ago and since there is no door jam switch so this means door disassembly.Thank you for your input. Your theory is right on with mine so I guess I’ll start on the door latch assembly today. Thank you again",,,,
612,Spark plug boot remover,Maintenance/Repairs,5,241,"Help please i happen dealing with this for over 6 months and have tried almost everything but apparently the one thing that WORKS.I have a 2001 ford f-150. I have a rubber boot stuck around my spark plug. yes i have tried a scribe set to pull it out i have tried lube to lube it up enough to wiggle it out. i have searched the internet for hours nothing seems to work. SOMEBODY HELP MEW PLZ. Its killing me in gas and has a really bad miss fire it runs like complete and total crap!!!I have 100 bill for anyone who can get it out no matter how long it takes!!They make all kinds of spark plug boot pullers.

Just need to find one for your application.
TesterCut the boot loose with a sharp knife. Lenghtwise. peel it away. Replace the wire, you likely damaged it already.
This is, of course, if you are talking about a conventional spark plug wire and not a coil on plug.I agree with Mustangman.  I was going to suggest a sharply pointed Exacto knife with the dull side of the blade and the tip going under the boot and push all the way down in, then peel with tweezers.
The easier option might be to break the ceranic end of the spark plug, vacuum out the debris fron the hole and just use your spark plug wrench to remove the rest of the plug.I found a dandelion digger helpful under the bottom of the boot, and had one at the time so no money out!
768×768 41.6 KBAt 20 years of age I would not even attempt to save the plug boot. Replace all of it.  I do not know if you are trying to remove it straight out but twisting the boot is what works best.
Besides, if you suspect the plug is actually what is causing the miss then it is also damaging the plug boot. Especially 6 months worth of this.
And I would also suggest with the plug out a compression check be run. If compression is dropping that will in turn soon kill a new plug which will in turn kill a new plug boot and so on.",,,,
613,Nissan Juke Smoking on Front Right Pls Help,Maintenance/Repairs,5,217,"Hi so I have a 2012 Nissan Juke and yesterday after pulling out of a drive through I noticed an oily/gassy smell that was coming from my AC. I turned the AC up to make sure, and then it got worse so I immediately turned it off. I was on my break at work so I continued driving back when white smoke started coming from the passenger front side of the car. No lights turned on indicating something was wrong and the it didn’t not appear to be overheating. The smoked stopped after about 3 minutes of driving at 40 mph with no AC. I was in a hurry to get back to work and didn’t look any further. I was worried but when I got off it was about 9pm so there wasn’t much I could do then and the smell was slightly there but not too noticeable. I drove home and everything was fine but I kept the AC off, now I’m worried and do not know what to do. I’m a girl in college and no family lives close by… so is it okay to drive it… and where should I bring it for this type of issue? Thank you in advance for the help!It sounds like there’s a refrigerant leak under the hood for the AC.
The next time you go to you use the AC and it doesn’t work, that’s probably what’s happened.
TesterI think you have a stuck brake. Either the caliper, slides or even the brake hose. Please have your brakes checked.The A.C. compressor could be seizing. The belt is slipping causing the smoke. But as  @Mustangman said it could be brakes. If he’s right it is dangerous to drive. You may not be able to afford to bring it to a shop, but you definitely can’t afford not to.Ask around for a reference to a good mechanic. Maybe ask someone who works at the school and has been there a long time. Please do not go to a national chain.The fluid levels should be checked with the engine cold before this vehicle is driven again, there may be a coolant leak.",,,,

I have had it for maybe a week now and have ran into trouble.  Going down the road last night, the car suddenly lost power and would not accelerate even with my foot to the floor.  The car corrected itself after 5 or more seconds and drove on down the road for another hour there and 1 1/2 hours back without issue.  No engine light ever came on.  I got back in the car this morning to make the same trip as the night before and didn’t get out of the drive way due to a lack of power and the motor shuttering so hard it shook the car.  I parked the car and made the trip in another vehicle.  Again, no engine light came on.  I came home from the trip, drove the car again, got a few miles down the road and the motor began to shutter and loose power again.  This time I had a check engine light.  I got home and pulled the trouble codes which were P351a, p352b, p353c, and p354d.  I searched the internet and found this link, http://ricksfreeautorepairadvice.com/p0351-p0352-p0353-p0354- 2 p0355-p0356/, which seemed to indicate a grounding issue.  I pulled the dust cover off the engine and checked the connections to the coils and replaced the cover.  I cranked the car, cleared the codes and the car drove and reacted fine.  I took the car to the store 10 minutes later and got the loss of power again and shutter of the engine.  Still no engine light, but I plugged my scanner up again and got the same error codes.  Anyone got any ideas?  Not a ford guy or much of an electrical guy.  Any help is greatly appreciated since we haven’t even got the license plates yet for the car, still have the paper dealer tags.

                So, after a little further investigation, it looks like my problem was a loose ground wire.  Watch the following video for details.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrLbsIz81pU.  Turns out the nut grounding the harness to the valve cover was loose enough to cause a short/open circuit on the ignition…
              
If you just bought this from a dealer, didn’t it come with some warranty or was it As Is? Since you have owned it for such a short time I’d be on the phone to tne dealer.
If it is one of the independent used car sellers, I’d suspect it might be a flood car with a reclaimed title. Did you have a CarFax or similar on this car? Wild electrical problems occure un flood cars, that is why I am asking.The car came as is, no warranty, and they were sure to point that out.  I bought an extended warranty through the dealership, but was trying to avoid paying a deductible if it was a simple fix.  We weren’t offered any of the CarFax information on the automobile.  The car looks brand new though.This is not going to be a simple or easy fix or likely even cheap. Electrical issues seldom are. Parts might be cheap but the labor to trace down a problem can be quite high.
Not promoting CarFax or similar, but you should have ordered one before buying as well as had your mechanic, not the dealer’s, give the car an inspection before buying. That horse has left the barn but consider both the next time you buy a used car.


 redneckred:

but was trying to avoid paying a deductible if it was a simple fix.


Seriously doubt this will be simple and you could spend more on parts that don’t solve the problem than your deductible .No offense, but I suspect you’ve found out why the previous owner traded in the vehicle.
Agreed with taking it back to the dealer, or to another mechanic. You bought that extended warranty; why are you afraid to use it now?
Good luck.Take it back ASAP so that the dealer is less likely to claim that it’s something you did. Since it’s a used car, they might exchanged it if they can’t fix it. Start with the fix route, then bring up exchange later if things don’t work out.So, after a little further investigation, it looks like my problem was a loose ground wire.  Watch the following video for details.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrLbsIz81pU 1.

Snugged it down and no more problems so far (knock on wood/fingers crossed).  I have driven the car all over town this afternoon without problems and couldn’t get it out of the driveway yesterday.

618,Air conditioning drains battery?,Maintenance/Repairs,18,38.3k,"My wife, when we first married, was always in the habit of turning off the AC in our car before turning the actual car off.  I didn’t understand why, and she fell out of the habit after seeing that I never did it and nothing went wrong.

 While we were visiting her parents, my wife did not turn the AC off on her dad’s car.  When he got in, turned the car on, and saw that the AC was turned on he reminded my wife that she needs to always remember to turn off the AC prior to turning off the vehicle.  He seemed to say that it had something to do with Arizona’s climate.

 I’d never heard this (my wife and I live in Virginia and I grew up in Philadelphia).  I always figured that while the car is shut off, the AC is shut off–no big deal.  Additionally, it seems like the owner’s manual should mention this if it’s a problem.

 Apparently, my father-in-law’s battery went dead the other day and he thinks this is due to all the times my wife left the AC on in his car when turning it off.  (I should add–this is not something particular to his car–he’s always had this policy, but this car is new)

 What say the experts?  Does leaving the AC on when you turn a car off cause problems in any way–particularly with the battery?I’ve been driving for 20+ years and have never turned the a/c off before shutting the motor down and never suffered any negative consequences as a result.  This is one of those old wives tales that get passes down from generation to generation.  Kind of like my grandmother used to keep the top of her console TV clean, would dust it several times a week because someone told her that the TV would ovwrheat and blow up if dust accumulated on the top of the cabinet.I cannot explain the reason for the dead battery but failing to turn off the A/C had nothing to do with it.
I too have your FIL’s habit of turning off all switches prior to shutting down the engine, but this habit comes from the olden days when you needed full battery power to start (especially in winter). Anyhoo, leaving accesory switches on overnight does not tax the battery at all. The electric power is controlled by the ignition switch. No ignition, no drain on battery.No related.  You can turn it off before or after turning to engine off or just leave it on.  Nothing will be harmed.  The Battery had other problems.  Make sure the charging system is checked before replacing the battery.Thanks for the confirmation of my thoughts, guys.
I think this is one of those things I’m going to keep to myself, for my own curiosity/informational purposes (I just wanted to make sure I wasn’t doing something wrong).  The “I told you so” is never safe.I would like to add a couple notes.  First, sometimes accessories are wired directly to the battery.  This is most likely to include the power outlets/cigarette lighter (depending on the model).  I also know people who wire their radios directly to the battery so they can play them without the keys.  So although I don’t see how the air conditioner could drain the battery, other electrical accessories can, in specific circumstances.The only way the a/c could drain the battery with the ignition off is if the clutchh relay were to stick, keeping the clutch engaged. But I doubt that’s what happened here.
Love your Everlasting Gobstoppers, BTW.So I made an account just to reply to this post cause I think this is very useful information, so I own a 2001 ford ranger and my ac only worked on max power. I then replaced the resistor and my ac started working just like new again, the resistor does exactly what the name suggests, it resists power coming to the blower motor which changes the speed of air blowing through your ac. In my truck it goes low, medium, high, and max. Also my ac only worked on max because the resistor has a failsafe on it which if the module breaks or fails then the batter then sends power directly to the blower motor, which is why there’s a max option and why it worked and all other ranges didn’t. Now just recently I would go outside and turn my truck on and it wouldn’t turn the starter motor, aka the engine wouldn’t start, but all my electronics would turn on including my ac and when I’d look at the battery gauge it would read at 1/4 battery power and when I’d look at the ac control it’d be on high (not max). Now I don’t believe my battery was draining while it was off, what I think is happening and could be the reason to this old wives’ tale is that when I would park my truck with the ac on, and specifically on the high setting (I’m unsure if the other modes apply yet and I doubt the max setting affects this at all), that puts an excess load on your battery, sure if the alternator is on it’s trying to charge the battery back up but since you have something “resisting” current, you’re technically still lowering the volts being recovered, so when you shut the vehicle off you already killed it from turning on again, I doubt this is an issue with new models of cars due to technological advances and less power needed to crank an engine. So I hope my story can help somebody out there, there’s always a method to the madness.When you turn the ignition switch to Off, the power to most of circuits, including the HVAC blower motor, is cut off. That’s with a switch that is working correctly.

I know of no issues this will cause with the battery, but living in AZ- leaving the blower on in the summer is a sure fire (pun intended) way to get a blast of extra hot air in the face when the blower first kicks on.
Yes I know that,  I meant when the car is on and I turn it off without turning the ac to the off position before, it doesn’t let my alternator charge my battery back to 12 volts because like you said the power to most conduits is cut off when the ignition is
in the off position. So when I go back the next day to turn it on, the battery doesn’t have the full 12 volts to power the starter. Solution, turn the ac off before I turn off the car, to let the battery get back to 12 volts so I can crank my engine over the
next day.

Couple things to make note of here:
-Your alternator does not charge your battery when the engine is off, nor is it supposed to.
-If your a/c blower is killing your battery over night, then you have an issue that needs to be addressed.
-Your situation sounds like you have a parasitic draw on your battery, or  you have a weak battery.  Get this looked at before it leaves you stranded.I saw your response on this thread. I’ve found that my a/c clutch was causing my battery to go dead. Does this mean the relay switch is bad? Or need replaced?Probably would have been better to start a new thread so that people don’t have to read through stuff that is over 12 years old
The relay is in the fuse box under the hood. Inside the lid you have a map that identifies all the fuses and relays. Switch the A/C relay with another identical relay from inside the fuse box and see if that solves it. If yes, it’s the relay.
How do you know it is an A/C component that drains the battery?I just found this forum and see something in your reply that applies to my 2011 Buick Enclave right now. There is a parasitic draw on my battery and our trusted mechanics that have looked at it are at a loss as to what it is. They are very sure it’s NOT an alternator issue, that it’s something else. One thing my husband and I have noticed is that for sure, at least 2 of the 3 times we’ve tried to start it and couldn’t get it to turn over, the a/c light came on and started blowing. However, in neither of these instances was I using the a/c the previous time I drove it. (I was adamant about this and remember it clearly because my husband fussed at me for NOT turning the a/c off before I turned the car off! I told him with absolute certainty that I had NOT used the a/c!) So if it’s not the alternator, is there any way my car’s battery is being drained by the a/c, even though it wasn’t on when the car was turned off?? HELP!!The AC is not your problem .  You can start your vehicle or turn it off with the AC on .  Vehicles with Auto Temperature Control do this all the time.  You really need a better shop .good way to test this:
Find the A/c fuse, the blower fuse, A/c relay- and pull them all out when you park your car at night.  Then, before reinstalling them, try to start your car.  If your problems consistently stay away, then your a/c may be drawing power overnight. (A stuck relay could possibly cause this)Thank you! We will give that a try.",,,,

If the mfr thought  that it was a good idea to shield the gas tank from exhaust heat (a truly radical idea…  ), then I think that the OP should also consider that piece of sheet metal to be important.

Again my thanks for your research.The hotter a piece of metal gets, the more reactive it gets, that is the faster it rusts.  If it rusted off, then it was getting hot and therefore probably needed.  If it wasn’t there to take the heat, then your gas tank would have had to take the heat and that would have rusted instead.If heat heat shields were absolutely necessary, they’d made out of stainless steel, and not made out of cheap sheet metal that rusts away.

So there is no hope of finding a used one in Arizona?
Tail pipes don’t get hot enough to accelerate corrosion.Funny how the “professional” mechanics call others amateurs and hacks for suggesting using a wire nut on a low voltage/current wire but those same “professionals” are more than willing to leave off a heat shield designed to prevent a gas tank fire. Proves getting paid to do something doesn’t mean you’re actually a professional…
The shield is there as a hazard mitigation. Just like you may never need that airbag you’re riding around with, if the need arises you’ll be glad it’s there. Kudos to the OP for not believing some “mechanics” know more than the people that designed and built the car…

Tail pipes don’t get hot enough to accelerate corrosio


Yes they do. The they are usually aluminized or stainless steel, but have you ever seen a tailpipe last the life of a vehicle?My 03 trailblazer had the original exhaust system until it was totaled in 2020, and it was in fine shape, so I assume it would have lasted longer, but is 17 years and 200k miles close enough?“Life of the vehicle” can be subjective, my 1973 Plymouth has the original tailpipes and the surrounding metal surfaces have not rusted away from the heat.",,,,
620,What wrecked this tire?,Maintenance/Repairs,28,961,"My next door neighbor is disabled and doesn’t drive any more.  Her Volvo wagon lives in her driveway/carport for weeks and months at a time unless somebody borrows it.  A  couple of weeks ago it was gone for a few days, then came back.
This morning I noticed that her right front tire was flat, and I alerted her .  If the tire had been flat earlier, I’m pretty sure I would have noticed.  The neighbor invoked her Roadside Assistance coverage, and they came and changed the tire.
They provided her with pic #1, which she sent to me.  The damage is astounding. In the larger gash, pic #2, I can put my finger clear through into the interior of the tire.  In both gashes I can see severed steel cords.
I think it’s clear that the tire was not like that when returned by the most recent driver (but who knows???).  It seems to me also that we can eliminate slow-leaking damage by the most recent driver.  And I can’t imagine what kind of tool a vandal would need to make those gashes, cutting all the way through the steel cord.
Do you experts have any ideas?

@CapriRacer - what do you think?That’s called tread separation.
This occurs when the tread separates from the tire casing.
This can be caused by a manufacturing defect.

TesterTexases – Probably more like 10 to 15 years old than 5 to 10, but I’m not sure.  Maybe she had new tires put on some time.  I’ll see if I can find date codes on the tire.
Tester – Your pic is more astounding than mine, but I think my neighbor’s tire was sitting still when it failed.  Could tread separation do that?if the tire is old, yes.
if look look at the tire, tread has been blown outwards
Meaning a complete failure of the tire.
Here’s how to date a tire.
https://www.tirerack.com/tires/tiretech/techpage.jsp?techid=11 3
TesterTo me, it looks like impact damage. Tread separation is unlikely on modern tires.

TesterThey wouldn’t be retreads, would they?  Is ozone high there?My first thought was old tires.Good question.  I don’t think it looks like something a vandal would do though-too much damage.  Seems to me if something was hit in the road, with that much damage, it would be hard to drive it back unless it was driven flat.  So maybe it was a tire failure and made it back and then went flat.  No question though the result is the same-new tire(s).Need to interrogate the last person to drive the car to see if they will 'fess up and admit to maybe hitting something. I would think if some type of road debris did this there should be some marks on the inner fender, suspension components, etc.
If someone hit something and even if the tire did not go flat I don’t see anyway  in the world that tire would not be bumping and thumping all the way to the house.Looks like ply/tread failure of an aging tire. If the tire had failed due to impact damage the sidewall would show signs of drive flat damage.Would over-inflating it have blown it like this?Tester is right.  That is a tread separation.
Cause?  Tire too old, underinflated, impact damage (There’s a divot out of the sidewall in Photo #1.)
We need more information to narrow this down!Regardless of what killed that tire, if you suspect the other three tires are 10-15 years old, you need to figure out a way to convince her to either get a new set of tires or get rid of the car. Yeah, she doesn’t drive anymore, but if someone else is driving it and they blow, and it causes a wreck that hurts someone, she could still get sued for it.Thank you, all, for the info and advice.  I’ll pass it along to my neighbor (especially the suggestion that she might be liable if a person using the the car with permission causes damage).I got a chance to take some more snapshots of the tire.  Pic’s 4, 5, 6 show the various markings.  Pic 4 is the only thing I saw that looked like it might be a date code (looks to me more like a serial number).  After I downloaded the pic’s I saw the tiny numbers in Pic 7 – maybe “13601”.  Can anybody figure out a date from all that?
Pics 7, 8, 9 just show more of the damage to the outer sidewall.  Definitely abused.

That would mean the tire was manufactured on the 36th week of 2001.
Tester36th week of 2001 ?!?! Wow.  I’ll try to take a closer look when I take her trash out this evening.I’d have to look it up again but I’m pretty sure the DOT number is the plant code where it was made.

Ford blows away earnings expectations as consumers buy up trucks during pandemic 8
Ford blew away Wall Street expectations as well as the company's forecast earnings for the third quarter on stronger-than-expected demand during the coronavirus pandemic.





Having spent a little time riding around in a 2019 model 4WD F150 recently, I can understand why. 5.0 V8, 4 doors. It was a very nice truck.
The owner’s only complaint was how high it was but he was too cheap to buy the running boards. And, of course, the 4WD’s contribution to that height.1 yr ago fords stock was $11. Its $7.70 today. Great results?
Market cap is $30B. Apple went down $75 B yesterday. And will go up the same amount today. It’s all perception.


 Cavell:

It’s all perception.


No it isn’t.  Sales dollars and profits are the reason the company is in business. And those results were pretty good. Yeah the stock is down, that is the only part that is perception.
Comparing Apple to Ford is like comparing apples to buffalo.
You might as well compare Ford to Uber… one company builds things, the other has an app. Both have value, one is undervalued, one is over valued… but that is MY perception, not the market’s.Airlines are 10% capacity. No sports. No restaurants. No hotels? Millions out of work. And stock market is fully recovered from March dump? Yesterday morning every stock was down 3% and Apple was up? Took a few hrs and Apple did bleed a bit but will recover just fine. Everyone needs a phone. Do they need a $65k truck?


 Cavell:

Do they need a $65k truck?


Once again, it is all about perception.  I surely don’t need a $65k truck, and neither do you, but if enough people perceive that they “need” a luxo-truck, and if they have the wherewithal to do so, then they may just go out and buy one.
Let’s not forget that people are socking a lot of money into savings accounts  right now–despite the fact that interest rates on those accounts are negligible–and I think that some people are choosing to treat themselves to something that–technically–they don’t “need”.I live in Oklahoma and it might be called truck country.  I do not want one of those over grown expensive trucks but they are every where .  I have been looking for a used Ranger of the years when they were smaller.  The prices of those are way too high .


 Cavell:

Do they need a $65k truck?


Apparently quite a few DO need a $65K truck.



 Cavell:

Maybe in your neck of the woods, but not everywhere. Not in Florida nor in Georgia from personal experience. IndyCar race up the road in St. Pete last weekend with 20K fans. I travelled to a sports car race outside Atlanta 2 weeks ago. 40-50K fans, hotel was fairly full as were the roads to get there. Restaurants open but not full.
Reports from friends in Ohio and Michigan were very, very different. It would be a miracle if 20% of the restaurants and small businesses re-open. Different Governors, very different responses, very different results.Yep, Apple is up 3% this morning. $60 billion. And ford is up 5%. NiceThe gaming of CAFE regs resulted in the marketing of station wagons rebranded as trucks(SUVs) which were outrageously luxurious in order to sell them to women. Marketing was so successful and coincidentally the price of gasoline declined to paint a great picture for truck(?) sales. But honestly the opulent four door behemoths are just swelled up station wagons after all.


 Cavell:

Do they need a $65k truck?


The actual transaction prices are typically nowhere near sticker prices when it comes to trucks. I bought a 2019 F-150 last year for over $13k under sticker price, without a trade mind you, and without playing games with floor mats for 3 hours. I still feel like I Ieft a bit on the table as far as negotiations went.  A truck that stickers for $65k, can be had for right around $50k OTD if you play your cards right.  The MRSP’s on trucks and truck-based SUV’s have been artificially inflated for about two decades now.Do people need a 65K truck, yes, about as much as they need a $1200 Phone.  I son’t tow anything and am retired so if I did wan to move something I can’t get in my car, it would make more sense to rent the right size truck.
I son;t mind that the sticker range up to 65K as much as the fat that they start at 33K.  { can remember when a ford, chevy or dodge pick op was cheaper than their lowest price sedan.I guess you have to remember that people will be driving more instead of flying, for a while at least, so a good solid $65K truck might be tempting.  I’m still thinking about the figures in one of the car mags that said males buy about half of the trucks and females buy the small cars and SUVs.  I got my quarterly statement though yesterday and stocks were 8% year to date.  I just don’t worry about individual companies anymore.  So making money but nowhere to go and nothing to buy.  I don’t think the truck would fit in the garage though, but my neighbor has two of them.

Yes, and I agree despite being a woman.
I’ve rarely had men try to convince me to trade my sedan for an SUV but oh how women I know spend a lot of effort trying to get me to switch.
I’ve nothing against SUVs.  Several made my short list both times I ending up buying sedans in relatively recent years.  My choice of sedans came down to an aggregate of factors.  Basically, sedans suit my personal needs and budget.
My frustration is that sedans are simply dwarfed by most trucks and SUVs these days, making it difficult to see traffic ahead down the road, etc.  And, increasingly, those driving gigundatrucks and SUVs seem to enjoy bullying drivers of smaller vehicles.  In that regard, men no longer hold exclusive title to aggressive road bullying.

And very often waaaay, waaay too close!It seems to me that back in the mid 1980s, U.S. manufacturers decided to get motorists out of station wagons and into minivans.  This worked for 15 to 20 years and then the auto manufacturers gave minivans the image of Soccer Mom’s vehicles and convinced the auto buying public to trade in their minivans for SUVs.  Now it’s time to get motorists out of SUVs and into crew cab pickup trucks.
I am rather surprised with the recession caused by COVID-19 that these expensive trucks are selling so well.  I well remember the recession that began in 1957.  Sales of the VW Beetle were strong and the AMC Rambler became popular.  The 1955 Chevrolet which was an efficient design turned into the ‘bat mobile’ 1959 Chevrolet.  The  big cars weren’t selling, so we got the compact Ford Falcon, Chevrolet Corvair and Chevy I I and Plymouth Valiant.  These compacts were a little too small for a family car, so we got the ‘intermediates’.  The Chevrolet Chevelle was about the same size as the 1955 Chevrolet.  I think the four door pickup trucks may be replaced with more practical vehicles in the near future.

Even here in California the prices of those older . . . the small ones, as you said . . . Rangers are absolutely outrageous.  Highway robbery, in my opinion.  In some cases, you might be better off buying new.  At least you can haggle and won’t be overpaying for used up old truck that probably needs a lot of work immediately



 Marnet:

Basically, sedans suit my personal needs and budget.


Yup . . . those big SUVs are thirsty and they’ll probably cost more to maintain and repair over the years.  Those big LT-series tires for the bigger SUVs aren’t cheap at all, at least not the decent tires.



 Marnet:

And, increasingly, those driving gigundatrucks and SUVs seem to enjoy bullying drivers of smaller vehicles. In that regard, men no longer hold exclusive title to aggressive road bullying.


Yes . . . big trucks and SUVs are great equalizers, so to speak.  Anybody, no matter their age, size, gender, etc. feels emboldened to act like a total jerk.  I’ve seen people who fit the description of “little old lady” get into Chevy Suburbans and drive like absolute menaces

I disagree with that. Having many relatives at the time working for Chryco and GM…it wasn’t the manufacturers PUSHING the public into minivans…it was the public WANTING the minivans. When minivans first came out the manufacturers couldn’t make enough. Sales climbed and climbed. They were very versatile. Delivery vehicles were also a big driving force to the minivan revolution. Sales in that market were huge.@MikeInNH. That may be true about minivans.  However, the reputation that minivans got as a ‘soccer mom’s car’ seemed to steer people from minivans to SUVs.  I agree that minivans are versatile.  I have owned five minivans since 1991. However, there really isn’t much that can be done with the styling of minivans.  I think it is the urge for buyers to want something different.  My 2017 Sienna looks like my 2011 Sienna except for the color.  My 2011 was maroon and my 2017 is gray.  I told a friend after I bought the 2017 that I had my Sienna repainted by Earl Scheib for $39.95.  He thought they did a wonderful job.  I bought a 2000 Ford Windstar from a dealer I liked working with.  When I was ready for a new minivan, Ford quit making minivans.  The dealer tried to steer me to a Ford Escape.  I went to the Chevrolet dealer and bought an Uplander.  When I was ready for another minivan and went to the Chevrolet dealer, Chevrolet no longer made minivans.  The salesman tried to sell me a Traverse.  I then went to the Toyota dealer and bought a Sienna.
I understand the 2021 Sienna will only be available as a hybrid.  Maybe Toyota will keep upgrading minivans.",,,,
622,Kia Rio Car is sliding when driving over manholes n bumps,Maintenance/Repairs,6,244,"I have this problem with my Kia Rio 1.4 Crdi 2016.

I have tried new wheels with no effect.
This problem concerns me alot also coes the car is moving towards on coming traffic. i hope you guys have an idea of what to do.
Thanks for your time.Sounds like something in the suspension is worn. Maybe shocks and struts, maybe a tie rod end, maybe a ball joint. It might just need an alignment.
The car needs to have an inspection of all the suspension parts to find the problem.Replaced wheels or did you mean tires ? Is tire pressure correct .  Also if you are not able to check and replace suspension parts or don’t have the tools get this in a shop soon .Note to self-avoid Kia Rios

Would a worn suspension do that. When you drive over a manhole you feel the backend of car go to the right and the front turns to the left. It feels more like it could be the steeringrod but i really dont know.
VOLVO-V70
tires and wheels but now you ask the warning light for tire pressure is on, this is because the tire pressure system dosnt work, it keeps going wrong and for that reason i gave up on getting it fixed. Could that be the reason alone ?
Cavell
90K milesSomething is loose or worn in the front suspension.  If it was tire pressure you can check it manually and eliminate that issue.  I’ve had one time when the front struts were worn so the wheel would bounce too much when it hit a bump, and the tire would lose traction and the steering would change a bit.  New struts fixed it.  But there are a few things that can get you where you are, and you need to either educate yourself on how to check everything or pay someone to do it for you.454 , Have you actually checked the tire pressure ? Something you should do at least monthly and check oil level weekly .

624,Auto Parts Markup?,Maintenance/Repairs,612,54.2k,"Recently, I had needed front and rear brake pads and a rear rotor. The auto repair shop used Napa parts which are OKAY with me, but when I compared the price the auto repair shop charged for the parts vs the Napaonline website, the auto shop was 40% higher. Of course I called them back and when questioned, they stated that they provide a parts & labor warranty - even though that is not anywhere on the bill for 12-18 months. The auto repair shop said that if the brakes fail, they will replace the parts include the labor for free.

 The other thing the auto repair store stated is that they charged ‘list price’ and the price I am seeing online is the ‘over the counter’ price.

 Am I being ripped off? Do all repair shops increase parts costs by 40%? FOr example, online the front brake pads cost $48.19, but I was charged $82.96.

 Thank youYou weren’t ripped off.  Many or most auto repair shops sell the parts to you at a mark up.  Each shop sets their own mark up, and many use the “list price” as one you are charged.  Pretty much a standard practice.
Look at the total price, not just the parts mark up, and quality of service rendered.  I am surprised that the shop doesn’t print their warranty information somewhere on their invoice, however.It is normal for a shop to mark up prices. It can be anywhere from 20% to 100% depending on the shop.
If they quoted you a price for parts/labor and you approved it, you have no recourse. You were not ripped off. You should have questioned the price before not after the repairs were completed.This is normal.  All shops do it.  And, while I haven’t checked into it, I imagine that the internet has forced Napa to cut it’s on-line prices to stay competitive, so that the repair shop may not get the substantial discount it used to, resulting in the large apparent markup.Yes, they did call with the price and I approved it. But the price provided was for the overall work, not a breakdown between labor and parts. Is this something that should be asked?
I understand that there is no recourse, I am just trying to understand the comment about the warranty. On the NAPA site, it states as long as the parts are installed by a Napa Auto Care Center, then the 12 month warranty applies. It does not state that I have to pay a different price.Thank you. It is interesting to note that the repair shop did state that they paid less for the parts than listed online. I am just trying to get my hands around this warranty thing…All parts are marked up for resale reletive to what what the SHOP paid for them. You did not buy your parts from napa , they did. And if they paid to napa the same price you could have they still will mark it up. Basic business practice.
Ford parts are marked up to reflect a 40% Retained Gross Profit and when outside parts are procured they are marked up only 30% r.g.p.
I don’t know what business you’re in nor how you make profit for your paycheck, but even if the dollars spent are high, no one stays in business at 0% retained profit.
DO NOT attempt to rebut that you could have got them for less elsewhere. You didn’t ! If that’s where you wish to get your car repaired then go there, it’s a free enterprise country. At the end of the day , mechanics cannot go to the grocery store nor pay their rent with a hand shake and a pat on the back.The way it worked some 30+ years ago was…A independent would buy the part from NAPA (or who-ever) at a DISCOUNTED price you and I could NOT get. Then they’d mark up the price and the final price usually was close to what you and I would pay if we walked in off the street to buy. I know many independents still get this discount…but from what I’ve seen recently in this forum…either
A) The discount is no where near what it use to be…OR
B) Some independents are now marking up the price some 50 to 100%…
Many independents will let you supply the parts. They won’t guarantee the part, but they’ll guarantee the labor.Thank you all for your replies. I must not have been very clear in my question and apologize for that, but I was really just trying to understand the warranty vs ‘list price’ vs ‘over the counter’ statement.Based on what you said, the parts warranty is there, per the NAPA site.  If there is a parts issue, then you may need to remind the mechanic that the warranty is still in effect, to gain the needed warranty satisfaction.  The labor warranty is whatever the shop’s policy is.  Sometimes it varies; some offer a strict 90 day warranty on all their repairs; others offer longer terms.just had new rotors and ceramic brake pads installed.
last week.the markup was 20%.
this paticular mechanic usually charges 30% mark up.heLast mechanic I used marked up the parts around 75%. Along with the $90/hr labor rate, I was paying him over $200/hr. I solved this problem by buying tools and a repair manual.That’s what I do when I have to have work done that is beyond my skill level. I’ve always had suspicion that some shops use cheap/inferior parts whenever they can and then mark them up to make a few extra bucks. My reasoning for this is that I’ve noticed that several shops that friends and family take their cars to for service will use no-name/genetic oil filters, plug wires, etc. Yet charge higher-than-you-might expect prices for them. On one invoice, a recall seeing a $7.95 charge for an oil filter (some generic brand) for a Crown Vic. At the time an OEM Motorcraft oil filter was going for around $3.50 at most parts stores before any discount.Realize on an oil filter charge it is all sort of made up for an oil change. Most places charge $24-$40 for an oil change. No matter what way you look at it, if the car is in for an oil change only the shop is not making any money. However they are getting a great opportunity to check vehicle and get potential work hopefully for mutual benefit.I think a mechanic is going to be a job that has the potential to make a lot of money in…When I was growing up…there were very very few kids I grew up with who didn’t know how to do a brake job, or even change a spark-plug and oil…Nowadays…MOST kids barely know how to open the hood…whats going to happen when they become adults???I’m not debating that at all. All I’m saying that some shops seem to use the cheapest parts they can find, but mark them up so much that they charge as much for higher quality parts that the customer could’ve bought himself. I had my Mustang in the shop to have some emissions part replaced, I forget what it was, but it was about 6 or 7 inches in length and mounted vertically in the engine, anyway it was pain to get to so I decided to have the Ford place handle it. At the time the car had about 75k on the clock so I decided to have them change the spark plugs while they were at it. The spark plugs on the 4.6L in a Mustang are nigh impossible to get to. I asked the service advisor how much extra it would be, he said that it would be $129.95 with the price of the plugs included. I already had the spark plugs with me, since my car has a supercharger and I need to use a colder spark plug for better drivability. I told him I already had the plugs, the price then dropped to $89.95 for the labor only. I don’t think a set of OEM Motorcraft spark plugs costs a Ford dealer $40. I know for a fact I can get a set of 8 at Advance Auto for about $25.Their profit that they pay for their meals and rent comes from labor, not from jacking up prices on parts. If I noticed a company doing this to me, and they have tried, I get them to lower it to something reasonable, or I pay the price and then send in a price gouging report to the state attorney general and any profit they would have thought they could make, would be spent on defending themselves from stealing from customers.Before you go on about the free market system and the American way, remember the American way is through a court room as well.Exactly Chris Truck I quoted out 3 shops for struts all the way around and front rotors and pads at no less that $1898 for my car last week, I went and picked up everything myself at Advanced auto with lifetime warranty installed everything myself in less than 3 hours total shopping and installing time for less than $450 total. Paying someone else $1500 to do something for 3 hours any idiot with a basic tool set can do is idiotic.@basicbosch, 1) Why in the world did you respond to a 7 year old post?


More importantly do not insult folks on this forum with your baseless statements.  If you want to have a mature and friendly discussion you are most welcome, but do not start with insults, you do not want to go down that road with us.


Business do mark up the products they buy and resell, they are not charities. They have costs they have to cover and they have to make a profit to continue providing the service they do provide.  The beauty of the free market system is you can negotiate prices and if you do not like a price you can go down the street, or if you have the skill set you can do the work your self.  There are many things I fix on my car myself, many that I pay the shop to do.  Same with they house.  I do not expect the service shops to give me the parts or do the work for free.

We may have had our differences in the past but I have to say I would be shaking your hand if you were here.  It’s really a case of dismissing the issue by talking about moving forward or the best one
""need for a change"".  I used to like to tell these folks that there is good change and bad change.  The good change is usually for the person making the change and the bad part is the person receiving the change.  Then I usually have to run to the bathroom when they talk about the “radio community” and our $10 an hr associates instead of employees, and our partners instead customers.  It’s really out of the Harvard MBA type schools of group speak.There’s no need to stop listening if you still enjoy the show.   A new Best of Car Talk  podcast will be posted each week with no end in sight.Mentally, substitute the world ‘comrade’ when they talk that way and it will make more sense.There are real issues out there that should keep us all awake from time to time, but getting all wound up over someone using a phrase of current pop culture language is a complete waste of my time and energy.Maybe a waste of time but I can listen to someone speak for about five minutes and based on the terms used and accents, can pretty much peg the person’s world view.  Not always but a lot of the time.  Maybe its different on the east or west areas but in the center of the country, people that end statements as a question with upspeak can be a clue believe it or not.

As far as I know, that is referred to as Valley Girl Talk because it (supposedly) originated in Southern California.    The first time that I heard it was in the '80s, in the little town of Solvang, where I stayed for the night on a drive from San Francisco to L.A.   In the local café, a couple of old-timers were excited to see a young, very pretty waitress, who had apparently not been on the job for a few months.
When the old guys asked her where she had been, her response was, “I go to college in L.A.??”.
My first thought was…Is she asking them where she attends college, or is she telling them?
Every subsequent statement from her also sounded like a question, and I have to say that this was the first time that I ever heard that annoying linguistic affectation.
Dear comrad Bing, what do you mean by that? Yeah, I’ve been to Solvang?  Nice place if you are Norwegian?

Scandinavian anyway.  It was a few years ago.I didn’t hear valley girl up speak when I lived in Southern CA Jan 1974 to Nov 1976. I first heard it when I saw the movie on TV in the mid 1980s.Ok. I’ve had a few up here but it’s Canadian Thanksgiving so I might be excused. What the hell are you trying to say? (To whereisthe bus). Please translate are you tranny kidding me for starters.
Talk about linguistically challenged…They are just millennia buzz words that tend to dismiss those who may not share the same opinion.  Comprende?   By saying things like “we need to move forward”  they are essentially telling people where they were, which may have been a better place, is not important and it’s a new age whether you like it or not.  Pick an issue.  It’s used to control discussion and objections.  Those fully socialized may not realize what is being done, but to some of us, it’s quite evident.  That’s all.  IMO anyway.
Sorry to upset anyone.
To put it in terms of cars,  “we need to move forward to self-driving, electric cars, that are just borrowed and not owned to save the planet”.  See?  It’s a conclusion without a discussion, and anyone not getting on board is just a foot dragger or worse.Saw a Toyota commercial this morning that revived “Moving Forward” followed by the current “Let’s Go Places”.Unfortunately, I don’t have a pod.You don’t have to load the show to an I-Pod.

image447×600 51.1 KB
This valve regulates the flow of refrigerant into the evaporator which creates the cooling effect.
TesterI suppose that could be a suspect if the blower was still blowing air into the cabin, but it was not and yet the motor was still running. For some reason the air door had closed; next day it ran perfectly again.In that case, the evaporator may be icing up.
The next time it does this, shut the AC off for a few minutes and see if air starts blowing out the vents.
If it does, turn the AC back on and see if that works.
If so, it indicates the evaporator is icing up.

630,2006 dodge charger blown head gasket question?!,Maintenance/Repairs,14,438,"I bought a 06 dodge charger from a private dealer a few months ago… At the time I bought it, it looked good. But after having it less than a week, discovered it head a blown head gasket. (Guessing maybe a seal was used before and finally broke)…The dealer agreed to have it fixed. Supposedly the heads were warped and needed to be re-machined…they did that…new radiator, and hoses etc…Well I just got my car back a few weeks ago and the exact thing happened again. I have severe oil getting into coolant reservoir just like last time. Did they not fix it correctly you think or is there a bigger issue that can cause this? My engine never smokes at all or makes noises of overheating.  No check engine light. Temperature  gauge stays in normal range as well.If they did not flush the cooling system there could be a lot of oil trapped in the coolant passages in the engine.  As you drive it will migrate to the high points.
You did not mention what engine . If it has torque to yield head bolts and they re-used them, it could lead to head gasket failure.
I do not know what the situation is with your used car dealer and any warranty. Talk to them and see what they say.
If you have no hope of them doing further repairs, and it is not overheating and you are not using a lot of oil, I would run a compression check and if the results are good, just keep driving.Dang, son.  Dealer pulled heads and new radiator, on a 14 yr old hood special? Agreed, ask dealer why oil is in cooling system. They seem to like to work on it.
Charger? That thing got a Hemi?

The only accurate answer will be from the dealer .  I think your best move would be to see if they will take this thing back and let you choose another vehicle .


 Cavell:

Dang, son. Dealer pulled heads and new radiator, on a 14 yr old hood special?


Highly unlikely.  Much more probable that the dealer put a new radiator, used one of the commercially available head gasket sealant products, and said that they fixed the problem correctly.  It would not make economic sense to pull and machine the heads on this type of engine–which necessitates a new timing chain kit, new gasket set, new head bolts, and numerous other incidentals–versus simply buying a working used engine from a junkyard and installing it.  I call B.S. on the claim that all this work was (supposedly) done.I wouldn’t doubt it they lied…hard lesson learned…I’m already in the process of having it fixed properly by someone else…they refused to fix it further. No surprise there.Supposedly  they have receipts from the mechanic shop they used and it’s all in there. But ya wouldn’t Shock me if u were right.I think your engine oil cooler is leaking oil into the cooling system, that is more likely than leaking head gaskets.Appreciate the quick response.

 Solved by JosieB357 in post #12 


                Thank you everyone for your responses! Turns out when my fiance changed the thermostat he let some air into the system and it was building pressure, and the car was actually overheating but I couldnt tell from the one place I was feeling. But he fixed it and it’s all good!
              
Where are yu checking the water level?  The level in the radiator is what counts. Do you have an infared thermometer>The fuel pump may be weak, causing the engine shaking. You might have the engine checked to see if there is a head gasket problem.


 JosieB357:

The “oil meter” as you call it is oil pressure, not level. The level on the dip-stick might be just fine but there is another problem with the oil system. The only way to check it is to have a mechanic install a mechanical oil pressure gauge onto the engine so the pressure can be observed and compared to the gauge in the car.
Same for the water temp. Even if the level is OK, the car might still be overheating. Testing that requires some device that can measure water temp to compare to the gauge.
You need to take it to a mechanic that can do these tests. It will cost $100-180 or so to find the problem. The repair cost is unknown until the problem is determined.I know it’s not overheating cause when I pull over I can put my hand on the metal part where the water runs and its just warm not scolding hot like where I’ve seen overheating cars are like. But thank you for your response! I’ll relay this to the mechanicI’ve changed the fuel pump a couple years ago. But I’ll ask the mechanic about the head gasket!I checked the water level in the white tub in the engine, where it says water on top, on the side it has two lines, the bottom says engine cool and the top says engine hot, its filled to the engine cool line


 JosieB357:

I know it’s not overheating cause when I pull over I can put my hand on the metal part


That points to the instrument panel starting to fail, or the body computer. It also points to the car not properly warming up either. That itself is a problem.
It also means the oil pressure readings are likely not correct either so the engine should be OK.
Finding parts for this 23 year old car may be more of an issue than finding the problem.
Good LuckBut will false readings still make the car shake when it says its overheating?It shouldn’t cause a shake but stranger things have happened.The plastic bottle where you check the coolant is an overflow bottle. You need to check the coolant level in the radiator after removing the cap and when it’s cold.
The overflow bottle is not part of the pressurized cooling system and only serves to catch overflow in the event the radiator decides to burp some coolant out past the radiator cap.
I assume by thermometer you mean thermostat? As for the oil pressure I would want to run a check with an external gauge to determine if there really is a problem going on; maybe due to sludging.
As for the shaking I might throw a wild guess out there that this could be related to a spark plug or plug wire ignition miss. I say this because back in the late 90s/2000s GM had a campaign going on in regards to spark plug wires on the V-6s in various makes and models. A campaign is a voluntary Recall but it has mileage and time limits so that campaign would long be over by now.Thank you everyone for your responses! Turns out when my fiance changed the thermostat he let some air into the system and it was building pressure, and the car was actually overheating but I couldnt tell from the one place I was feeling. But he fixed it and it’s all good!Wish I saw this comment sooner! It actually was a problem with the pressurization and coolant, from when he changed the thermostat, but we got it all fixed now! It was shaking probably from actually overheating, but if it starts shaking again I’ll be sure to look into that recall campaign, the car only has 69,000 miles so as long as it isnt time based it should be good, again thank you for taking the time to try and help!",,,,

My car always has a slight miss at idle, and if I am stopped for a while with my foot on the brake, it gets a lot worse, and the engine shakes violently, but smooths out when I take my foot off the brake.  Whether I leave the transmission in gear, or shift it into “P” or “N”, the same thing happens–after idling for about a minute with my foot on the brake, the engine runs really rough, and taking my foot off the brake lets it smooth out.
My engine does not smoke, or use any oil that I can see, however there is a TSB for the 2004-2005 Chevrolet Aveo, which uses the same engine regarding valve guide and valve stem seal wear.  I had this vehicle looked at by a professional mechanic back in June who noted that the compression was about 130 PSI on two cylinders and about 150 PSI on two cylinders, and that the spark plug for cylinder #3 has oil on the threads and on the electrode.  Other than the idle issue, this car seems to run fine, and has decent performance and fuel economy for a compact car.
Also, the check engine light is always on, unless I disconnect the battery and keep the fuel level topped off to prevent the evaporative emissions monitor from running.  The codes are P0442 and P0456.  I had a smoke test done, and the (alleged) leak was not found.  There is no way to run bi-directional tests on this car without the factory scan tool, which no one has.
Any ideas for solving the problem would be appreciated.  I am otherwise satisfied with this car, and don’t really want to deal with the hassle of trying to buy a different used car.Have you checked for intake system or vacuum leaks?My best guess is that the power brake booster’s vacuum supply from the engine is the source of the problem.I agree with VDCdriver about looking at the power brake booster.
Try unplugging the vacuum hose from the power brake booster and plug the hose opening.
Then get back in your car, step on the brake again to see if the idle gets rough again.Sadly, the brake booster is not the solution.  I tried disconnecting the brake booster, which still had plenty of stored vacuum when I removed the hose, and plugged the hose by inserting the back of a Sharpie marker and closing the hose clamp over it.
With the brake booster disconnected, the brakes are of course much harder to apply, but the result is the same.  Having my foot on the brake for a while makes the idle much worse, taking my foot off the brake lets it smooth out.
Some people on the Internet say that this type of problem could be a failing idle air control.  A new one on Rock Auto costs about $60.  Does this sound like a worthwhile investment, or is it likely something else?Yes, it’s a worthwhile investment. You might check if your car has an EGR valve as well and give it a clean. Its a 2002, stuff is getting older. You have an EVAP system leak as well that you should have looked after.

This is puzzling.
How long does it take for the idle to get much worse, once you step on the brake?
And when you let go of the brake, how long does it take for the idle to get smooth?
And if you let it idle on its own, (without stepping on the brake), the idle remains smooth?
Thanks.I decided to go to the local “you pull it” yard, and got a low-mileage used throttle body assembly, removed the TPS and IAC, cleaned it thoroughly with paper towels and carburetor cleaner, and reassembled it.  I stopped at AutoZone and got a new throttle body gasket, although maybe it’s possible to reuse this type of gasket.
When I removed the throttle body assembly from the intake manifold, I noticed a huge amount of oil residue inside the intake manifold, much more than I would expect to see.  I took some pictures, and then stuck a paper towel inside and cleaned up as much of the oil as possible.
Anyways, I installed this throttle body assembly with the new gasket and started the engine.  It seemed to idle ok at first, but as it warmed up, I noticed a “stumble” every 30 seconds or so, and I could see the engine visibly shaking when this happens, and I could see by looking at the writing on the accessory belt that the RPMs drop real low and then recover.
I also noticed that if I take the oil fill cap off, lots of oil mist sprays out, more than I have seen on other engines, but the valvetrain looks clean (no sludge) and the oil level on the dipstick stays above the “full” mark.  I also heard a hissing noise, which might be a vaccum leak somewhere, but unable to determine exactly where the noise is coming from.
Now, putting my foot on the brake or not, or having the transmission in gear or not does not seem to make a difference.  Once fully warmed up, it idles better, but there is still a slight miss.
I was already advised by a professional mechanic who looked at this car that the poor idle quality may be due to the valve guide wear problem which these engines are noted for, although he could not prove it, and could not recommend such an expensive repair based solely on a guess.  Also, he could not find any published specification for what the cylinder compression should be, only that the “service limit” is 100 PSI, and that the engine should be repaired or replaced if any cylinders fall below that value.
There is a device under the intake manifold which has a wiring harness. a fuel line going into it, and a nylon hose going from it into the throttle body.  I removed the connection from the throttle body while the engine was running, and it revved up a lot, but once I plugged the opening on the throttle body, the engine went back to running how it was before.  I believe this device is part of the evaporative emissions system, and perhaps there might be an internal leak which might also explain the evaporative emissions codes?
There is a procedure to reset the base idle speed whenever the IAC is replaced, so I will attempt that procedure and see what happens.
Any more ideas?",,,,

                If you pull the front O2 sensor and install a sensitive pressure gauge, a converter that is plugged will show positive pressure. Anything over 1 psi at idle is bad. Rev it up and you might see 5 psi or more. Dead giveaway the cat has done a melt down. 
Since the rings are worn, the amount of oil run…
              
Yes this is a big job plus you will have to pay to dispose of the old engine and transmission. That 1300.00 engine on line must be used and might not last very long.
Sorry , but this thing has reached the end of it’s life span .  Replacement vehicle time.After 16 years and ~350,000 miles, I’d put that money towards a new car. Too many things with that much mileage and time could be getting ready to goI’m not liking the way this is heading…
I was hoping to hear that it would be a pretty easy engine swap.
@ VOLVO-V70-it is a used engine from a salvage yard with 86K on it.And you have no idea if this engine is in any better shape than your own. It’s a 16 year old econobox, just junk it.You never said whether the check engine light was on… Nor did you check for an exhaust restriction… the latter is important if swapping engine.
But those compression readings are pretty bad…
If the engine is the same year and everything for your car, I’d swap the engine and transmission at  the same time as both are on their last legs. It is a do-able job if you take pictures, mark wiring, be diligent about keeping track of bolts and such and take your time.
That said, wheel bearings, CV joints and shafts are all likely ready to die and need replacing. If the engine is out, it would be stupid not to replace the oil pan gasket and rear seal as well as the front trans seal while they are out and you can reach them. If the engine has a timing belt, 86K or not, it must be replaced and that includes the front seal and the water pump… You see where this is going? $$$$ and time.
And if this is in a state where salt is used on the roads in the winter… forget this job and scrap the car. Rust is already about to kill it.Sorry but IMHO it’s time to move on. My Corolla is a 2009 in good condition with 120k and if it needed an engine I’d get rid of it. A dealer might sell a really nice 2004 for $6k, which is more than a private seller would get, and at 350k yours likely doesn’t fit that category. Plus, I know a guy who swapped out the engine in a Cressida and he didn’t describe the experience as fun.I put a vacuum gauge on the intake manifold side and read 11 in Hg on a cold engine.  I lost all vacuum as soon as I touched the throttle. It would stabilize around 8 mm Hg at 2,000 RPM. I could not see a slow loss of vacuum at 2,000 RPM.  Is there another way to determine if the exhaust is clogged.  The amount of heat that is being generated from the exhaust manifold makes me think something is going on there.
No check engine light.
I’m in the south east, so no worries with the rust.Most definitely does not meet that description. It’s my junker commuter car. But there is some hard to describe value about having a total junk box. It’s almost like wearing a badge of honor to keep the thing on the road.


 clherron2000:

But there is some hard to describe value about having a total junk box. It’s almost like wearing a badge of honor to keep the thing on the road.


Oh, I understand completely. In the mid 80’s around the time my wife and I were first married I owned a 1977 Oldsmobile Omega for a short time. It became known as “my valuable $300 car.” It was both challenging and rewarding to keep it running until the day it simply wouldn’t any more. But you need to decide if a 16 year old junker is “the hill you want to die on.”If you pull the front O2 sensor and install a sensitive pressure gauge, a converter that is plugged will show positive pressure. Anything over 1 psi at idle is bad. Rev it up and you might see 5 psi or more. Dead giveaway the cat has done a melt down.
Since the rings are worn, the amount of oil run through that cat has likely melted it. If you find pressure, you can open the exhaust right before the cat and give it a quick run… in the day… it will wake up your neighbors.
If it is clogged there might be a little more life in the old girl.It sounds to me like the engine has a lot of wear, but is still in serviceable condition, although there might be an exhaust restriction (perhaps the catalytic converter).  Since you live outside of CA and NY, you can buy a cost-effective aftermarket cat online, and you can add Restore to the motor oil to help the performance and oil consumption.  (Remember to always do a fresh oil and filter change before adding the Restore for best results.)If you are not ready to say goodbye to your Corolla, I have another suggestion.  Instead of buying a used engine/tranny and doing a lot of work  when you don’t know whether they are good…buy another low-mileage  2004 Corolla and use your current one for parts.  This would be the “highest usage” for your old car.
I’m sure that your wife and neighbors will not mind a parts car parked on the front lawn, and your old favorite car can stay with you for years.The compression is pretty bad and that is backed up by the poor vacuum reading of 11 inches. As for losing vacuum when you blip the throttle that is entirely normal. It’s doing what it should do.
An engine in good condition should have a manifold vacuum reading at idle of around 19 to 21 inches with a rock steady gauge needle.
If it were me I would say goodbye to it and I’m of the type who keeps a car nigh on forever. On top of engine or trans issues everything else on it has 350k miles also and as mentioned buying a used engine or transmission is always a flip of the coin. Salvage yards always say everything in the yard is “guaranteed good” when the reality is they do not know and individuals will often lie through their teeth.

Hope so . . .Just my two cents. Take that $ 1600 as a down payment on a newer car maybe 2 years old. Mostly because its your life .And newer cars have abs and airbags guaranteed to work . as well as things that wont rust tomorrow  letting your life be in danger.Don’t put a penny into that car.Get wrid of it because It reached the end of its life.This did the trick!  I used the low drum of generators (we had a power outage in the neighborhood) to mask the noise of driving around without an exhaust and the, limited as it is, power has returned.  I’m going to buy a $100 catalytic converter from eBay and rent tools from Advance Auto. Thanks for all the input and advice.  Looks like I can live on this hill for a while longer.",,,,
637,“New” seems pretty old,General Discussion,14,758,"I purchased a new 2017 Nissan Pathfinder SL on December 2016 from a Nissan dealership. With it I received two years of free oil changes and other goodies. Because it was my wife’s main vehicle, and she’s more organized than me, she made sure I always took it to get an oil change ahead of its due date. That service ended December 2018. Since then, I’ve been doing my own oil change every 4-5k miles.
Early this year we started to see blueish-white smoke when we accelerated after being idle for 45+ minutes (waiting in line to cross international border). Then, we would see it from time to time when we turned on the car in the morning. Now, we see it almost every time we turn it on. We took it in to a nice shop to have them check out what the problem was, and they said they found sludge stuck on the spark plugs. In fact, based on what they saw, it appeared as if my vehicle had never had an oil change EVER (their words). They say that the piston rings could also be damaged.
Obviously, by now all warranties have expired. But, if it turns out that after 46 months my dealership-purchased suv does not have proper lubrication and burns a lot of oil due to inadequate maintenance, can I hold the dealership liable?
PS: one month before the engine and transmission warranty ran out, we started hearing strange sounds from the engine. We took it in about two weeks before it expired, and they said everything was perfect, nothing to worry about. I don’t think they were being honest.The dealership should have showned you the maintenance history of the vehicule and you should have ask for it before you bought this vehicule.Without it,there is no way to tell for sure if anything major happened. You could try getting the carfax  history report but unfortunately work that are done outside a dealership are seldom showned on these reports.You are on your own.This is a 3 year old car. Nissan has a 5 year 60K mile warranty on the powertrain. Are you beyond the 60K miles? … you didn’t tell us the mileage. If you aren’t over 60K you should make a claim with the dealer and Nissan. All the oil changes at the dealer should be on record and any maintenance notes you made when you did the changes will be important. You should also contact Nissan corporate. The number is in your owners manual. A lawyer that specializes in this might be helpful.
Good Luck.


 arqbrulo:

they found sludge stuck on the spark plugs. In fact, based on what they saw, it appeared as if my vehicle had never had an oil change EVER


You know they’re wrong, since you’ve been changing the oil for the last two years.  How many oil changes have you done?  The next step is to get a compression and leak down tests to see if the smoke is from worn rings or worn valve seals.


 arqbrulo:

can I hold the dealership liable?


The legal system is all about proof.
Unfortunately, even if it is true that the dealership falsified the maintenance records and failed to actually change the oil, proving that truth will be difficult–at best.The Jeep was purchased NEW.


 COROLLAGUY1:

The dealership should have showned you the maintenance history of the vehicule and you should have ask for it before you bought this vehicule.


The vehicle was purchased new in December 2016. No  negligence here by the owner. Possible negligence by the selling/servicing dealer.But there’s no actual evidence the dealer failed to perform the oil changes.  How could the OP prove it?  Now the owner has the problem (assuming the car is still under the power train warranty) of proving that the owner did the oil changes for the last two years.Did you DIY those later oil changes?
Going forward, whenever you have a shop doing oil changes check the dipstick before leaving to verify the oil level and that it’s new, clean oil.
Do a visual inspection, if possible, for other services.
I had a friend have problems with his 1987  Toyota because the shop wasn’t doing the services:
Corroded cooling system because coolant wasn’t changed.
Timing belt slipped because it wasn’t changed, and it stretched.I am curious about one thing, would like comments.  “Sludge on the spark plugs”. Perhaps carbon build up, but sludge?Did you receive a copy of the repair order on these free oil changes? Even if the dealer was doing them free of charge to you there should still be a paper trail as a repair order is always written up no matter who gets billed for it.
If the Used Car Dept. for example sends a used trade in back to service to have the front brakes replaced there will be a repair order written up and billed to the Used Car Dept.; albeit with a discounted parts markup and discounted labor rate.
What would I recommend you do? Go in and have a sit down with the service manager. Keep it civil at this point and maybe with the cell phone “inadvertently” left on Record.  Ask him to produce copies of those ROs right then and there. If he cannot produce them then I’d say they were pulling a fast one and the next step (letting the SM know this also) is that you will be contacting corporate Nissan and drag them into this problem.
Don’t let the SM know that anything that was said is recorded at this point in case some tit for tat comes into play later.If the dealer hasn’t performed the maintenance during the last two years it is unlikely that they will take responsibility for the current condition of the vehicle.Truth is- while somewhat unusual, it IS possible the dealership service department committed fraud.  The problem is going to be PROVING it.
But another thought- how many oil changes have you done yourself since the dealership “deals ran out?  It’s hard to imagine so much sludge that the mechanic things it’s never been changed.
How many miles on it currently?Sludge?  More like carbon, ash, or oil.  Smoke on start up usually indicates valve seals.  Blue/white smoke while running usually indicates piston rings.  IF these parts have failed, there is probably no coralation with possible maintenance issues.  Ive seen late 2000’s vehicles have piston ring failure from design failure even with regular and proper maintenance.  Is your engine using oil?  Go to the dealer and tell them your issue/complaint and ask them to set up an oil usage chart.  They will most likely have you pay for a fresh oil change, and then document your oil consumption when you return weekly or bi-weekly for and oil level check.  Keep the document in your vehicle. Also ask for any documents on your vehicle that may result in oil usage or ANY other engine issues. If they find nothing, or even if they do find something, go to other sources for documents (manufacturer bulletins and recalls).  Plus get copies of all your oil changes from them.  Paperwork paperwork paperwork.  I worked at  a GM dealership repairing engines and transmissions and this is the way the game was played.As Mustangman pointed out, depending on the mileage this may still be under warranty so we first need to know the mileage.
Next, since you’ve been doing your own oil changes for the last 2 years can you get some sort of support from your records or credit card statements to backup your oil change claims?
Finally, assuming you’re over the warranty mileage, how much over are you? 10,000 miles? 100,000 miles?
Then once you get your ducks in a row, take it back to a Nissan dealer, explain the problem and see what they say and here’s the important part …
Remember that “all business is personal” so instead of ""going in with both guns blazing, simply explain the problem (NOT WHAT MECHANIC #2 OR WHAT ANYONE ELSE SAID) and ""remember the phrases, “can you help me?” and “I need your help.”
If you start out accusing them of fraud and theft, the normal reaction is to “circle the wagons”, “lawyer up” and say NO.
But if you appear to be a reasonable person and simply ask for help, people will generally bend over backwards to give you a hand so the problem’s solved although you may have to push it up to a higher level.
As just as important, when buying a new car that’s under or near under warranty, spend the extra couple of bucks to have the service done at the dealership. Yeah, it’s not legally required but it’s going to eliminate a lot of “who struck John” when you’re under warranty and buy you some loyalty if you have a serious problem.",,,,

Do the dolts actually get cold, more?
1- Put on clothes, go.utside into the cold.
2- Slip into the cold vehicle and starthengine.  (Not remote start.)
3- Out into the cold again
4- Walk in the cold back to the house.
5- Outside again into the cold walking to their vehicle.
I just get in, start engine, immediately place in Drive.

That aside I warm up my vehicle the same way you do, by driving it,  The car warms up before you lose the body heat you carried out of the house.  Leave a window open a little and don.t turn on the heat until the engine temp starts to come up and the windows won’t steam up.
In the old days before we had trucks with insulated cabs and separate heater and defroster cores and window fans when going up to Watertown and North we used to dress warm and carry a blanket. The only was to keep the windshield clear was to turn off the heat 'let the windshield freeze on the inside, scrape it clear and crack a window on the side opposite the wind.  Winter nighttime temps were usually -25F or below.  The coldest I was in was -43F.I was confused too. I think it’s local (To CO) slang.
Means a car that’s running and unattended…puffing smoke.Puffers -  A term used to describe vehicles left running unattended so anyone can just get in and drive off.

That’s what I thought too.  I don’t use it much but my remote start is pretty secure.  It only goes for 10 minutes and then you have to start it again if you want.  The doors need to be locked first and if you get in, you can’t shift it out of park without putting the key in and turning the key on.  So not likely to be stolen by anyone.I think Robert Gift and I should start a 100 mph club for car talk members who will admit to going over 100 on public roads.  The only reason my grandmother never drove 100 is that her 41 Studebaker Commander would not go much over 90. The first tine I cracked 100 was in a 1940 Buick Century with the twin 2 barrel carbs.  It was fast but handled like a pig.
I have actually had a few blowouts over a hundred. Nothing dramatic happening as long as you don’t hit the brake, just let the tire slow you down til you get under 50.
A rear blowout is more dangerous because there is a drop and swerve involved with the rear trying to steer the car. You have to counter steer to correct but the worst thing you can do is over correct. AAA did some tests in the 50s or 60s and found out the most dangerous speed for a read blowout was between 55 and 60. That gave the most violent drop and swerve Above that speed the centrifugal force or the wheel and tire gave you more stability.

Lots of luxury, plenty of utility, not much sport.





I had my little G6 up to 90 inadvertently.  It wasn’t even trying so heaven knows how fast it would go.  I had to pass two cars on a stretch that does not have many options to pass.  So just hit the gas and when I looked down I was going 90.  No effort at all.  Got it down to 60 again by the time I sailed past the cemetery.  Slow drivers on two lane roads are very dangerous.

639,2010 RX350 check AWD system,Maintenance/Repairs,8,421,"A while ago my “check awd system” light on my 2010 Lexus RX350 illuminated. The car has been well maintained and I rarely drive it (maybe 10 miles a week). It still seems to drive the same, but the light is on. I thought it was linked to the gas cap, because it seemed to appear out of nowhere and will turn off occasionally. I recently purchased a new gas cap, but the light hasn’t turned off (I haven’t been able to find a correlation when the light turns on and off). Our driveway (where the car is parked) is on an incline.If the gas cap was the culprit, the Check Engine Light (CEL) would have lit up.
This is also almost surely not related to parking on an incline, and the fact that you rarely drive the vehicle has nothing to do with a possible AWD system problem.
Because the AWD warning light portends potentially pricey repairs to the AWD system, I strongly suggest that you have a qualified mechanic inspect the vehicle a.s.a.p.Have you replaced the tires?  If so, are they the same exact size on front and back?  Different sized tires often lead to AWD problems. We can’t trouble your system with the usual diagnostic tools that a repair shop can. You should take it in for an evaluation. If you have a relationship with a shop already, take it there.The code c1298- linear solenoid. We took it in and the shop said that they tested the power supply for 4wd ecu and it was fine. They checked tested the wires from the ecu to the solenoid sensor and it was fine too. And they checked the connectors and they were fine too. They didn’t really know what else to do. I guess it’s time to go to the dealership.The tires were all replaced last year, a while before the light came on. I am not sure the sizes, but I would assume they are all the same (I can check in a bit). Last time I took it in they said they should be rotated and balanced as there is some abnormal wear, although the tread is good.


 lilithlex:

Last time I took it in they said they should be rotated and balanced as there is some abnormal wear,


Did you follow their advice at that time?
Have you consistently rotated the tires as specified by the mfr?   (I think that this is supposed to be done every 5k miles, but it is possible that the mileage interval is a bit longer on this model.)
In any event, uneven tire wear on an AWD vehicle can cause damage to the drive system.I didn’t that time (because it hadn’t been even 3k since the tires were replaced), but I do get them rotated and balanced per manufacturers specs or sooner if the wear signals that it is needed. I was planning on taking it in and getting it done with the light came on. Would it be worth it to get it done now, before going to the dealership?Next step is to measure the resistance of the solenoid. If the power supply, wiring and solenoid are good, the ECU has failed.
Tire condition has nothing to do with this, there is an open or shorted circuit in the rear differential AWD coupling solenoid. This means that the AWD lock feature won’t function when you push the button on the center console so stay out of the mud.Thanks @Nevada_545 . Is this something I can do, if so how? Or is it best to bring it into a shop. Do you have an estimate of how much this repair would cost? Also, as long as I don’t need my awd lock button (I am pretty sure I have ever used it) is it ok to drive the car occasionally or should I get it fixed asap?",,,,
640,2001 volvo s40 transmission fluid. Change?,Maintenance/Repairs,21,8.3k,"Just bought 2001 s40 with 88k miles.   Transmission is smooth but when I checked the dipstick the fluid color is a kind of dark.   I was thinking of changing it.   Here are my questions/doubts:

 1.  The fluid is ATF Dexron III and Mercon oil.  Right?  What is the best brand to use?  Castrol?

 2.  As I was looking for the fluid at pep boys, i met the service manager i knew.   i asked him about the transmission fluid.   he mentioned to check the service record.   I did not have the service record.   he said if the fluid has not been changed ever,  it usually got into trouble (?).

 but in the haynes manual, it mentioned that:
 transmission fluid does not usually need to be changed unless the car is used as taxi ( then it needs to be changed every 40k miles or so).   Because of this, i think i can change it anytime.   am i right?



Although I’m just reading this now, I would like to point out that if your transmission is running find - DO NOT touch the trans fluid!!!  Secondly, the off-the-shelf trans fluids are abrasive to Volvo transmissions.
Your transmission wears over time, and lifetime trans fluid (like the fluid in your S40) is designed to compensate for the wear.  As a matter of fact, it actually utilizes the debris and grime that builds up in the trans.  If you flush or change out the fluid, you then deprive the transmission.  How do I know this?  I went against the advice and replaced the trans fluid on my 2000 S40.  About 3 or 4 months down the road, I had big problems. Lets just say it has never worked the same, and it’s getting worse by the week.  I am now faced with the decision to replace the trans (Volvo tranny’s run about 3 or 4 grand) or get a new car.
Even at the time I changed the fluid, every Volvo specialist I talked to said “Don’t do it!!”  I just thought they were full of it… it didn’t make sense to me either - why NOT change the fluid?  It looks dirty, right?  I really hope you didn’t go through with this!The OP did not tell us if the trans fluid has ever been changed on this 8 year old car, but I surmise that it has not.  In that case, it should definitely be changed–but NOT flushed.
As to the preceding comment, I am going to compare that person’s situation to the patient who dies on the operating table during a Quadruple Cardiac Bypass operation.  That patient would have died if he did not have surgery, and was unfortunate enough to die during the surgery that was necessitated by his poor health.  Both instances of death would have been as a result of him not maintaining his health properly for the preceding X number of years.  In other words, that surgery may give the patient a few more years, but it cannot be counted on to overcome years of neglect of one’s diet and exercise regimen.
When the person above changed the fluid on his 2000 S40, it was likely very much overdue, and as a result, the trans would have failed anyway.  This type of “Hail Mary” servicing of an older transmission rarely works.
What does work is changing the fluid (and filter if so equipped) every 3 yrs/30k miles.  People who follow that type of schedule rarely experience transmission problems.  When trans fluid is not changed on that type of schedule, whether the fluid is first changed  after many years of not being changed or whether the fluid is left alone, the trans is going to fail–usually anywhere between 90k miles and 140k miles.  Such is the price of neglect.I’m with VDCdriver on this one.
If there is something sensitive with Volvo transmission changes, I’d welcome hearing Transman’s input on it.
While I’ve only rebuilt about 5 auto transmissions (and that was 30 years ago), I’ve never heard of a transmission utilizing the debris and grime buildup - as if it were a good thing.I did change the transmission fluid;  drain and refill.   It only took 3.5 quarts vs 8-9 quarts the repair manual said.   Most of fluid are still in the gear (?).
I decided to change after consulting with a friend of mine who teaches auto mechanics at local college.
so far it is ok.  i used mobil one synthetics atf.   I was planning to do another drain and refill again soon to clean up more of the fluid.  so far, transmission is working as before if not smoother ( it may be just psycological since i changed the fluid).
I have not checked the current fluid ( after it mixes with old ones in the gear) because i do not have time yet.
somebody told me that if you start to have some issues with transmission, best way is to flush and refill with originial type of atf or synthetics.   maybe add some additives like Xado to improve metal to metal friction.   Not sure if it works.Use the type of fluid recommended in the owner manual or a reputable transmission specialist.  Do not use additives unless recommended by a reputable transmission specialist.  Change the fluid every 40K as outlined by the severe service recommendations.  You could not drain most of the fluid via the pan because most of the fluid is in the torque converter.It is OK that your drain-and-refill only takes 3.5 quarts while the whole transmission takes much more.  If you do that every 30k-40k you’ll be fine.Here is more explanation on why some do not recommend changing transmission oil.
my guy ( who is teaching auto mechanics at local community college) explains as follows:


atf oil is lubrication but the enemy is heat.


when it is overheat,  atf oil breaksdown and did not really function


but when transmission shifts, there is “disk” to move it ( i do not really sure ), and this one will expand as atf oil brake.  so it is like to compensate


thus, in old one,  when we flush with new oil,   the “disk” will shink back and causing some issue.


thus,  if it does happen,  the tranmission failure is just waiting to happen anyway.


i will drain and fill every 20-30k miles since i do it myself the atf cost is minimal.I know you’re only passing along the input that your mechanic is telling you, but there is little hope of trying to convince anyone on this forum on reasons why transmission fluid should not be changed.I recently bought a 2005 Volvo S 40 with 175k on it. After heating up, the transmission slips a little and goes in to drive hard. I figure changing the transmission fluid will hopefully fix the issue. Whats everyones thought on this and did I waste $1100 on the car. Otherwise, its in great shapeI think you would have been better served by posting this before you handed over the $1,100.I purchased the car because I watch a lot of shows where they buy older cars and fix them up. They ran in to a few problems where the transmission was slipping a little when it got hot and they ended up changing the fluid which fixed the issue, maybe I am hoping it fixes my issue. I purchased the car to use for the winter months to drive to my new job and I didn’t want to drive my BMW convertible in snow. Would I be better off leaving the fluid alone or drain a little and add Lucas or do a flush. I only plan on using the car a few months till I receive a company vehicle.You bought car with issue.
Changing your fluid did not cause issue as you have not done it yet
2 different scenarios.
Shifts hard when hot. Something is worn?
Bad seal/o-ring? New fluid won’t fix worn partsMost transmissions are neglected until they come a problem and then people get rid of them. Odds are the seller knew it had an issue before they sold it.
I would change the transmission and hope but keep in mind that changing the fluid is not always an answer for a problematic transmission.
Also, don’t put a lot of creedence into automotive TV shows. There’s a lot of creative editing and BS involved. One show I watched one time involved an allegedly bad starter motor on a Ford truck. They determined the starter WAS the problem without one minute of actual diagnosis. Then they slid under the Ford truck with a GM starter motor and all was well…   ;-I’ll be blunt . . .
I would expect a $1100 car to have some issues
Either mechanical, cosmetic . . . or both
a transmission fluid and filter service won’t be terribly expensive . . . but it likely won’t change anything
But it sounds like the car is still drivable, even so
Do the trans service . . . not a flush . . . and drive the car until the transmission drops out completely, then dump the carThe car is in excellent condition, new tires, starter, battery and no body damage. I have plans to drain the trans fluid, replace it and add Lucas and hope for best. 3 months is all I need and its all highwayIf it turns out to be fine or reasonably fine after a fluid change have you considered just keeping it around for a backup car? I’ve always had one or two extras  sitting around for those times when I have to service the main set of wheels or when something goes stupid.
For 1100 dollars I do not think you got hurt at all. Even if the transmission went completely out and you chose to go as far as installing another trans I think you are still ahead in the game considering what used cars are selling for; some with far more more miles and problems this one might have.I will probably keep it around for winter use. If the tranny goes out, I definitley don’t want to put more in it that I paid for it although the motor is strong. I would sell it as a mechanics special. I didn’t buy the Volvo tranny fluid, they didn’t have it,  the Mobile synthetic they had which I boughtCould be a internal solenoid which is gummed up alsoYes, I heard that also. I will have to cross that bridge if that is the issue. Monday, it goes in to the garage to get changed, 160175637308034750279160536269353468×4624 3.81 MB",,,,

I have looked at multiple suvs’s in junkyard and all are the same. It’s not an issue with my 05 alone.Are you sure about that? Did you check with someone in the drivers seat, engine on and in drive?
I have never seen a GM vehicle with DRLs that could be turned off. Doesn’t mean one didn’t exist though. Many have a dedicated fuse for the DRLs that allows them to be disabled.Oh, I’m sure. I park in garage. Start suv and lights automatically go on. Without touching MFS. It does this on 07 torrent and 05 equinox. But I can rotate control 1 click CCW on torrent and lights go off. I don’t drive torrent a lot but I sometimes take it to work and park in front of large glass window. I can easily see the headlights in reflection. Lights are always on in equinox. I can see the lights go off when I chose driving the torrent.image3264×2448 1.46 MB image3264×2448 1.5 MBThe 2nd pic shows the additional position below “auto”.

The 07 equinox lets you turn off the DRL. So it’s a gm thing.
So, gm allows you to turn them off but it’s illegal?


 COROLLAGUY1:

You can get fined if you try to mess around with it


Where did you that? It is not required in the US, but it is in Canada. Maybe illegal in Canada, should not be in the US.
I disable them because I used to ride motorcycles that have had DRLs since 1981 for the visibility. Pollute the roads with a bunch of 4 wheelers with DRLs and MCs get lost again. I don’t think that is a good thing so I will not participate.

Seems to have been an after-thought. Manufactures realized that people needed a way to switch off the lights in certain situations.
20201031_1250361932×2576 1.52 MBSecurity posts want you to turn off the lights completely so that you don’t blind them. Unfortunately, a lot of cars with sentinel lighting used to be controlled only by daylight. This used it bother me when I approached these posts in a rental without the turn off feature.Manual says auto is default. And daytime use will have low power DRL. And switch to normal power intensity at dusk. I have never seen that. My lights never change from low power to normal power.My 2012 Camry will shut off the DRL If you really want other people to see you, turn on your headlights.
NY has the law that your headlights have to be on when when it is raining. DRLs do NOT comp;y with the law, they are not bright enough and dpnot turn on the tail and side lights.Auto is low power during day. And switches to normal power at dusk. Have you seen that, old timer?
My 05 has auto only. No off switch. But I never see brightness changes.
The manual says that for 07. I have not looked at 05 manual.You need to make sure the tail lights are coming on at night. The the light sensor has failed, the night running lights may not be triggered. If the tail lights are coming on, try setting the lights to ON not auto and see if they change brightness… I think you may have done that already…The auto function works for both suvs. But neither have brightness changes. And both have taillights on when dark out.  I think the taillights are off during day? Might have to verify that now.
I have dbl garage but 2 single doors. Garage is dark even during day when only 1 door is open.It’s not illegal here in the states  .  My 20 Durango doesn’t even have DRL’s .   A lot of GM vehicles allowed this.  All the Trailblazers and Envoys allowed you to do this  because I do the same thing  .   This  was mostly about not burning out the headlights on the vehicle.  the earlier  vehicles never had LEDS which were good for the life of the car  .  I always found headlight  DRL’s annoying as heck .  If they were just the parking lights it was fine .I know on GM  the DRL’s were the headlights and they supposedly ran at about 60%  during the day  and then full power once the light sensor   dictated it was dark enough to turn them on 100% .

Went to get it titled and long story short, the motor I put in didn’t belong to the car I took it out of! Now what?You can’t transfer title to the vehicle because the engine came from a third car in the mix and not the second? Why do you need an engine serial number to title the car? Is this a salvage vehicle?You don’t have a vehicle problem , you have a legal problem . Also you don’t say what state you are in .
Used motors are put in vehicle all the time so there must be more to this story.The Washington State Patrol has a guide for salvage vehicle inspection, What they require for yards such as pick-n-pull.

Overthinking I thinkThat is bureaucracy at its absolute worst
And this is a perfect example of why so many people hate it
This is where some local government official needs to step in . . . in my opinion, for what it’s worth . . . and say “I’m taking charge and cutting through this red tape.  Give that man a title for his car.”I have purchased many used parts–including a used engine–from junkyards, and never once received an invoice showing the VIN of the car which the parts came from.  Even when I purchased the used engine, from a junkyard where they pull the parts and have them ready to go, the only information on the receipt was the type of engine and the year/make/model it was from.  I cannot believe that this type of invoice will not be accepted if someone is trying to repair a salvage vehicle to obtain a salvage-restored title.What state is this and you’re saying they did an engine serial number inspection?  This whole thing sounds ludicrous and I wonder if you just happened to deal with someone who has no clue.
By that logic, what would someone do if they installed a crate engine which did not come out of a car at all? Even engine reman facilities have no idea what cars their cores came from.
Years ago I bought a 1941 Harley from a guy out of CA. He gave me a valid CA title, CHP inspection, Orange County sheriff inspection. LAPD inspection, OK OHP inspection, OK County sheriff inspection,  and OK City PD inspection. Three argumentative visits with the local tag agent led nowhere. The lady there emphatically stated “You are not ever going to get an OK title. Ever.” I won’t repeat what I said in return.
I went to the OK Tax Commission and it took the supervisor less than 2 minutes to approve a title for me. He also stated I had enough paperwork for a dozen titles and that the DMV agent was an idiot. Maybe you were dealing  with someone similar at your DMV.The resolution sometimes is to go to a different office of the DMV.  I also have had good results asking the DMV office to take my request, charge me the basic fee to do the bureaucratic thing I came for, and refer the matter to their home office for resolution.  In my case they “send it to Sacramento”.  It takes forever, you might get letters asking for something you have already done or some other strange thing.  Just do it.

I don’t know what that means.
Sounds like you have a long list of problems here. We need some more info. when the car starts, is the check engine light on? What codes is it showing? What other warning lights are on when running? What transmission do you have? Manual or automatic?



 TJ03:

everything that is electrical powered doesn’t work


Seriously? EVERYthing? Lights, radio, turn signals, brake lights?? EXCEPT the starter? That works and starts the car?
Start searching for a burned wire - the fuse-able link in the engine compartment near the alternator and make sure the battery grounds are all present and connected properly. Trace the battery red cable to the starter and then a big wire from the starter to the rest of the car. Is it there? Is is burned up?
That should get you started. Post back with what you find.yes nothing works, I was charged 250$ to change some sensors at a auto shop and a week later the same problem occurred. All the car can do for now is start and idle. I can rev it and it will run fine but if I try to put it in reverse or drive the car jerks and eventually loses power and cuts. I try to roll down my windows and the same thing happens the car jerks loses power and cuts off. It’s a v6 3.9l automaticExactly what was the diagnosis of this shop that “charged 250$ to change some sensors” . . . ?

So now I know what transmission you have but none of the other questions I asked. We still can’t help without at least those answers and the other things I suggested you check.
If you aren’t capable or willing to do this work yourself, I’d suggest towing it to a competent shop and be prepared for a large bill or sell it to a junkyard.I’m having the EXACT same problem with my 2004 Mustang. Same specs, except a manual transmission. I was stopped at a light one night, and when I put the car into first gear and stepped on the gas, the radio, dashboard and headlights went dark, the car sputtered and jerked and then died. I replaced the alternator, battery and belt, and everything was great for a month or so. Then it happened again the other day. Just like the other poster wrote, when I jump the battery and start the car, it idles just fine – until I attempt to drive it. Then the same thing happens again. It appears to drain the battery when it happens, too. Could I have screwed something up when I replaced the alternator?I suspect there is a faulty connection in the main electrical bus somewhere. It could be a bad main ground, a fusible link or in the hot side of the power bus. I would first check the wiring from the battery and to the main panel under the hood along with the grounding. Try moving the wiring while the engine is running to see if you can make a change. Try tapping on the main panel with a screwdriver handle or something like that. If that doesn’t make anything happen then check the ignition switch and wiring to the dash fuse panel.",,,,

Why did you continue to drive it if you were experiencing steering problems?

No, the driver of the car should have prevented the accident. If the car was driven into the brush the driver should have steered the car back to the road and/or applied the brakes to stop the car.

Why would a Nissan Rouge 2020 crash


Hmmm… Perhaps your Rogue was offended that you were unable to spell its name.   
Seriously, however, the preceding comments are right on target, in my opinion.
It is worth noting that Nissan has had more problems with their automatic emergency braking system than any of the other manufacturers, but the problems have been of an entirely different nature than what the OP is complaining about.  The 1,400 complaints–so far–about Nissan’s automatic braking problems had to do with the system applying the brake when there was no obstacle in its path.   Many of the complainants stated that snowbanks on the side of an expressway could cause their car to come to a sudden stop, thereby exposing them to the possibility of being rear-ended at high speed.

As Smokey says “only you can prevent forest fires.”   I gotta a feeling this is related to why deer don’t cross where the signs are posted.It sounds like you were experiencing some major malfunction, and you didn’t get it towed to the dealer.When buying our 2017 Rav4, the salesman had gone to a training session on the features. The autostop or whatever it is called during a light rain failed to stop before plowing through a cardboard obstacle. His advice was it is a nice feature but do not depend on it.I agree with the other commenters - all of the safety systems should be a backup for the driver, not a primary substitute. These are more advanced but it’s similar to saying “I didn’t avoid the accident because the seatbelt was supposed to save me”If you really experienced these problems, you should contact a lawyer if you haven’t already. I hope that you and any passengers are OK.First, safety systems can’t overcome the laws of physics. If physics dictates that you’re gonna hit a tree, you’re gonna hit the tree, and at best the safety systems will make you hit the tree slightly softer.
Second, if the car is behaving strangely in a dangerous way, and you continue to drive it, the resulting crash is your fault, not the safety systems. Safety systems are not there so that you can turn off your brain while driving.",,,,

ThanksThere should be a fuse.
Have you checked your owners manual?I agree with Mike.
However, are you doing the work yourself? If so, you’ll want an “exploded view” drawing of that portion of the dash assembly. You can probably get this from the dealer parts window if you ask nicely. That’ll show you how the thing is assembled, and that makes disassembling it to replace the switch much easier.
If you’re not doing the work yourself, simply bring it to the dealer and request an estimate to replace the switch.I check the fuses, I can replace a fuse, no more than that
I will have to get it fixed by a mechanic
or I just use a scraper to remove ice buildup from the window
thanksyes I checked the manual on fuses and their location
thanksAlso take a close look at the affected window and the wire leading to it. Look for a break in the wiring, connectors, or the grid itself.Sounds like the switch is contaminated or worn out. Having to press harder or temperature dependence are clues that it may be the switch itself. If you can gain access to the switch, it may be something that can be cleaned with an aerosol spray meant for this purpose but it’s going to require some disassembly to get there…thanks
no easy way to get to the switch
the winters aren’t bad here, I may just not get the switch fixedthanks,
there is no visible wire
the grid is molded in the glass
it must be the switchIt appears to be fairly common failure on these cars if you google it. I found one thread addressing how to replace the control unit here- http://forums.nicoclub.com/i-think-i-rear-window-defoster-is-broken-t475207.html 813
The switch can be replaced by someone with the skills and patience to do it but easier to replace unit. Even that takes some doing.There should be a separate fuse for the rear window defogger, as that circuit is one of the bigger current drains in a car. Suggest to stop by a Nissan dealership and ask them to show you where it is.  Bring your owner’s manual along.    From your post I’m guessing the problem is the switch itself has failed.Thanks for the link, there was this comment:
…the problem is a switch that is soldered into a circuit board on the back of the A/C Controller Assembly. There is no practical way to repair this switch nor swap out any sub-assembly. The entire controller (which consists of the 3 rotary knobs and the 2 push-button switches) must be replaced. The switch fails in the same way a single button will quit working on a TV remote control. I purchased a used controller from a junkyard. The online parts manual shows that the original controller has been superseded by a new part number. I also noticed that my old one did not have any orange illustrations on the mode selector, but the newer one I purchased has matching orange illustrations for the fresh air knob and the defrost settings.
so a lot of work to a take the dashboard off, replace the whole unit, not just the switch, not an easy fix
not an easy fix

Easy is relative. I would have no qualms about removing and disassembling that module to replace the switch. Someone who has not done that kind of work before would understandably be quite apprehensive about such an undertaking. By the same token, if it were mine I might just rig up an external switch and splice it into the wiring harness that goes to that module and not have to even touch the module let alone remove it.
BTW- you don’t need to remove the dashboard. You have to pull some of the trim garnishes to access the module. Not hard to do at all if you have done similar work before. It’s all about knowing where to pry and how hard 


There is no practical way to repair this switch nor swap out any sub-assembly.


I certainly do not agree with that statement made by that person in the referenced thread. I only posted the link and supporting info so you could see one path to resolution and that you have company in this regard since it’s a fairly common failure mode for that car.If you’re pretty certain that’s the problem, replacing the controller with a used one sounds like a good plan.   On a 17 year old car those kind of work-arounds are often necessary to get the job done.  Suggest to keep the controller you remove.  If the replacement part fails later for the same reason or a different one you might be able to find an auto-electric specialist who can replace just its switch.  That kind of job is easier if you have the factory service step by step procedure at hand.  It’s probably worth your time to search a little to see if you can find it before you start.Hey guys. Easy fix. Just take all the trim off to the point where the switches are exposed. Shoot a bunch of electric contract clean in and being the switches. Wait a day and bam. Works great. My wife’s versa the rear defroster button would not turn on and the ac would not turn off. After the contact cleaner all works great!

649,Prius Mileage,Power/Fuel,16,1.4k,"We purchased a 2008 Prius last March.  Our mileage used to vary between 47 and 50 mpg in mixed town and highway driving.  We noticed in early January that the mileage was 37 and it has improve since then, but only to about 40 mpg.  I called the dealer and they said it was winter gas that is sold in this area.  Is that right or are they just blowing smoke?Winter gas, ethanol in the gas, and heater use can all reduce mileage.  The engine has to run to provide heat for the interior, so it runs more in the winter than it does in the summer.Dealer is at least partly right.  If you are not getting a CEL (Check Engine Light) I would not worry.  Cold temperatures and the fuel mixed used in winter in most areas, will give you lower mileage.The winter gas reason is true as it is for any car, but the hit you get in the winter is especially bad on the Prius because in cold weather the gas engine has to run a lot more. You might notice that the first time the engine kicks on when you’re driving it stays on until it’s fully warmed up, and obviously that takes a lot longer when it’s cold out.Whoa! … Why Didn’t They Explain This To You Before You Bought It?
Why did they wait until you found out about the poor mpg on your own? I know they are trying to sell cars, but they also need repeat customers and word-of-mouth advertising. Something doesn’t sound right. 37 - 40 mpg for a Prius? Why did they wait until you found out about the poor mpg on your own? 
The question was about the drop in mileage during winter, not low overall mileage.I Know. Why Wouldn’t A Dealer Alert Customers That MPG Will Drop In Winter? 
At time of purchase the overall mileage looks pretty good. I mean they are trying to sell cars, but why have their customers searching to find out why their mileage drops to almost non-hybrid range. Also, lots of Prius people search here asking why they have to buy so many tires. Why aren’t they informed of this at purchase time? I would be ticked. I still say that something doesn’t sound right.

And, for you, @Whereisthebus, all I can suggest is that you learn to use the available technology on this site before you post another inappropriate criticism, as you did in regard to me.agree with getting a second opinion.   Parts can go bad when working on unrelated parts, just as parts can go bad from not working on unrelated parts. Parts fail- it’s why I will always have a job as a mechanic.  Parts can also be abused during an unrelated repair. it happens.
A second opinion can help you get an understanding if something was done wrong to cause your new steering issue (jack or lift marks on the R&P? damage marks on suspension or steering parts?)  Get another set of eyes on it and see what the report it.As an aside, I realized many years ago that most alignment shops view “Align the wheels” and “Centralize the steering wheel” as two different jobs and often do the first without even thinking about the second.

Well yesterday I did this and now the car won’t crank or anything. It’s like the starter doesn’t even attempt to do anything. Wondering if maybe there was a fail safe that was tripped or what. I highly doubt it’s locked up because like I said it was running fine before shut the car off myself. Don’t know what to do and it’s stuck on the side of the freeway.Try shifting into neutral and see if it will start.
TesterTemp gauge goes from hot to normal in 30 sec? Nice
Are fans running?I’ve tried. I’ve tried disconnecting the battery for a long period of time, I tried jumping it thinking maybe the battery was too low.Yea I think it’s a thermostat issue or a clogged coolant line that was causing it. But now it won’t crank or do anythingwhen was the last time you checked the oil ?An overheted car does not cool off in 30 seconfs even if the gauge says it does. Your radiator may be low on coolant and when you shut off the engine the coolant is not surging and hitting the coolant temp sensor. The sensor can’t read air.
You may have a seized engine now.I unfortunately agree with oldtimer_11. What has the coolant level been throughout this situation?


 oldtimer_11:

You may have a seized engine now.


Yes, a definite possibility, based on…



 Joshua-70:

overheating occasionally and when it does I pull over before it gets too hot, shut the car off and it only takes maybe 30 seconds to cool


If you were driving–let’s say–a '52 Plymouth, repeated overheating might not take a toll, but repeated overheating incidents will almost always take a major toll on modern engines.   Anyway… as oldtimer_11 stated, an overheated engine doesn’t cool-down in 30 seconds, so there could well be a problem with the temperature gauge, as well as with the engine.",,,,
652,Passenger side car power socket v12 won’t go off,Maintenance/Repairs,9,323,"Hi,
Jeep Grand Cherokee 2000 4.7 when the car is off, the passenger side power socket won’t go off (driver side) it does.
How to make it so the power socket goes off?
RegardsIs this a new problem ?  Why do you need it off anyway ?  Maybe it is supposed to be on .If you leave something plugged in it will just run your battery down .If you want it to go off, the car will need to be rewired.
Some manufacturers turn all sockets off when the car is off. Some don’t and leave them on. Apparently in 2000, Jeep did both.Just unplug whatever is in the socketThe wiring diagram I’m looking at shows one 12V power outlet in the front,
image1280×960 141 KB
And one 12V power outlet in the rear.

And both are hot all the time.
TesterOn another Chrysler product - my 2007 Town and Country - the secondary outlet can be powered full time or part time. It depends on where you place a fuse in the underhood fuse box. Check your owners manual for details.I am wondering, since the night before my brand new battery was 12.59V and in the morning 11.99V so worried if it will go to 0 if left for a week…
I think there is a power leakage…In my '02 taurus, there are two sockets in the dash, one is hot 24/7 and the other is hot only when the key is turned. It’s a feature.


 workforumwork_169205:

think there is a power leakage…


Yes, there is. It is called a parasitic draw and can be tested to see what is causing the draw. If you have an aftermarket radio, subs, alarm or remote start, assume it is one or all of them.If nothing is plugged in that outlet won’t drain any power.",,,,

I felt wobbling in the front left wheel, especially when the car starts driving or when applying brakes. The mechanic said it could be something with the transmission, but the car running good and the gear shaft is smoothly moving, no problem. I thought it could be bad rotors or something in the brake system, but the mechanic said those components are okay. Does anybody has suggestions away of misfiring.
Thanks


 Soliman:

wobbling in the front left wheel,


You need a different mechanic.
This could be a tire problem, suspension problem, or steering problem.


 Purebred:

You need a different mechanic.


^This +1. A transmission issue wouldn’t cause the wheel to wobble. If you’ve eliminated a warped rotor the issue could be a bad CV joint or possibly something suspension related.How do you know it’s the left front wheel?Thanks for the reply
I feel it when I drive, especially when the car accelerates and stops. I have asked my friend to take a turn to drive and I sat in the passenger seat, I did not feel that motion as obviously as when I drove.SolimanYour hands are not on the wheel in passenger seat. How do you feel the wobble? Thru the seat?I felt that motion even without holding the steering wheelThat leaves your feet and seat. Where do you feel the wobble?


 Soliman:

The mechanic said it could be something with the transmission, but the car running good and the gear shaft is smoothly moving, no problem


Have you paid your mechanic to diagnose and repair the problem?
Or have you just spoken to him, and he gave some opinions without actually driving the car?
On the other hand, if your mechanic drove the car, experienced the wobble and still has no clue, then maybe he’s not a very good mechanic . . . ?That in no way points to the left front wheel for certain. You need to have this checked by a mechanic. It could be as simple as a wheel balance problem or as serious as an impending failure of a steering or suspension component.",,,,
655,Car shudders when in gear and foot off brake,Maintenance/Repairs,36,9.6k,"I have changed the ignition coils, spark plugs, and belt tensioner, nothing seems to be making a difference.
When I first put the engine in gear with my foot on the brake no problem the engine doesn’t shake but as soon as I take my foot off the car shudders until I get going with a bit of speed.
I can replicate this issue by putting on the E brake while in gear but like I said when my foot is on the brake no shaking.My car shudders similarly to your description when the RPMs are too low.  This happens in first if the idle is too low, higher gears when I should be in a lower gear.  I have a manual transmission: I get to choose my gears; an automatic should make the right choice as long as the idle is set high enough.stopped, in gear, foot on brake. no vibration
remove foot from brake and not pressing gas and vibration starts?
does car creep forward with foot off brake and no gas pedal?Is it possible that the motor mounts are in need of replacement?
I would suggest that the OP have a qualified mechanic check the motor mounts.Exactly right and the car does move forward but here is when I get the most shudderingI had an idea it could be the mounts. However, the engine doesn’t seem to shift a significant amount when I put it in gear.Mine is automatic, not sure if this would be related? Hopefully, we get some clarity here.If you could either clamp shut or remove the brake booster vacuum line and plug it, you could determine if the booster is the problem (leaking in air and causing a lean mix).  DO NOT DRIVE THE CAR DURING THIS TEST.


 Jon_yaboi:

Mine is automatic, not sure if this would be related? Hopefully, we get some clarity here.


Does it happen only in first gear?  Does it stop when you reach a certain speed?Is the check engine light on?  Any diagnostic codes in the computer memory?  It does sort of sound like what insightful above is suggesting, the engine is running a little on the lean side at the lower rpms, and misfiring.  When you step on the gas enough it causes enough gas to be injected the low rpm lean problem is masked.    A small vacuum leak should be considered.  Clogged injectors could cause it too.  You might try running a bottle or two of injector cleaner through the gas tank.   A couple years ago I had a sort of similar problem on my Corolla where it would jerk only in slow speed neighborhood driving.   I wouldn’t describe it as shaking, but when I stepped on the gas say after slowing for a corner, arouind 10 mph,  instead of smoothly increasing in speed, it would not increase in speed at all at first, then  all of a sudden jerk forward.  Very annoying   Setting the idle speed to spec and an injector cleaner treatment fixed that problem for me.Happens at low idle just starting out, basically when you just take your foot off the brake and are gently accellerating the. Stops when you get going like 7mph and up.Sounds reasonable, I will be testing that and will post the results thank you.Alright, I went through the whole engine bay and checked for vacuum leaks while it was in gear and shuddering. I also pinched off the vacuum lines to the break booster under the same conditions to no avail. This sure is a resiliant issue.I have ran a full bottle of injector cleaner through previously seems not to make much of a difference, I am with you on injectors except the relationship to the brake is odd. The engine never acts jerky, always just the same shudder at low rpm and in gear.Still not resolved, please help.This is exactly the behavior I get with a low idle: did you check the idle?Have you  used a hand-held vacuum pump to verify the brake power booster is holding vacuum to 20 inches hg?Just ran the codes on the engine here is what I got

Family's Truck Stolen In Centennial While Packed With All Their Belongings,... 1
Along with the truck, the thief took nearly all the possessions of a family of four, including the wheelchair of a 13-year-old daughter with epilepsy and the books of a mother putting herself through college.





What can be done to make theft more difficult?I think it was a 92 f250 as a work truck, the ignition lock did not need a key to start the truck. Sorry for the family.Lots have been done in 28 years to make car theft harder. Google them. Those solutions tend to cause problems as the cars age.


 Robert-Gift:

What can be done to make theft more difficult?


A kill switch is about $5 and very effective, unless you’ve got a mechanical fuel pump.  Maybe someone just needed a ride.This particular truck would be easy to wire a switch in to disable the fuel pump relay. Kind of after the fact now.
Hopefully the police catch the scumbags who stole it and odds are this is not the first,second, or even third rodeo for them.
In OK about 10 years ago some guy tried to steal a pickup in broad daylight. The homeowner grabbed a firearm and went outside where the thief tried to run him down. The homeowner shot and killed the thief. There was some whining and hand wringing over the death of that bum.
Court records showed that guy had 53 felony convictions in the past 15 years which to me means why in the hxxx was he even out anyway? 53 convictions makes me wonder how many he got away with.
Drug dealing, burglary, armed robbery, 3 POs by 3 different women with 3 ensuing assaults on all of them, 3 assault and batteries on police offers with 2 of them involving deadly weapons, and pretty much everything else that constitutes a crime. The homeowner should have been given the key to the city.


 ok4450:

3 POs by 3 different women


Couldn’t figure out what a PO was then I got it, protection order.
Some people think that buildings and possessions are not important but they don’t realize you need to effectively deal with this right away or it breeds more of it.   When I was a kid, steal a car and you’d get sent to the reformatory, 16 years old or not.For many years the 1990’s vehicles have been a target for petty thieves and joy riders because they lack an immobilizer system.


 ok4450:

The homeowner shot and killed the thief. There was some whining


Clearly the thief valued this man’s truck more than his own life. No need for whining!


 Robert-Gift:

As others have noted, a hidden ignition kill switch would have helped.
That vintage vehicle had an ignition switch that was pretty easy to pop out with a dent puller, which then made it easy to stick a screwdriver in and turn it like a key.",,,,

664,Pacifica vs. Sienna,General Discussion,18,584,"Hello!
We are looking for 4WD Minivan to be safe in Colorado Winter. Our options are Sienna or Pacifica. They look both appealing to us based on Youtube videos. We like to test drive them next week or the following week. I wonder anybody has any strong opinion on one of them. Also How do you compare the maintenance cost of a Toyota Sienna and a Chrysler Pacifica?
Thank you all in advance!I owned a 2011 Sienna and now own a 2017 Sienna.  Neither have 4WD.  My son now has the 2011 Sienna and it has logged  about 130,000 miles.  The two repairs have been a water pump at 90,000 and an alternator at am125,000 miles.  At 34,000 miles, I have had no repairs on the 2011 Sienna.  I have had no experience with Chrysler minivans.I have a 2014 Dodge Grand Caravan and I have spent many hours at the dealer. I have 42000 miles.I like the Chrysler vans for their versatility and I find they fit me better, but the Toyota Vans definitely average less frequent repairs.  If you are buying new the Toyota traditionally depreciates slower, if you are buying used, the faster depreciation of the Chrysler is to your benefit. If you ever want it to haul things, the stow and go seats in the Pacifica are wonderful.FWIW motortrend ranked the Pacifica as the number one minivan and then the Sienna as second. They don’t care much about reliability though.
As mentioned, if it was me, I would try and get a good deal on a used Pacifica, that is if you liked it during the test drive.Pacifica is renowned for cheap used prices in want ads. For a reason.
A Pacifica is comparable to a Venza. Look at that too.


 mozkaynak:

Also How do you compare the maintenance cost of a Toyota Sienna and a Chrysler Pacifica?


I doubt there is much difference if buying new . Of course you did not say new or used .  If used then there is not a way to tell because not all used vehicle of any brand have the same problems all the time.


 Cavell:

A Pacifica is comparable to a Venza. Look at that too.


The New Venza (2021) is considered a Luxury Rav4. Same platform (engine and drivetrain)…but it only comes as a hybrid and more like a Lexus.You get the quality and piece of mind for years when buying a Toyota vehicule.The Chrysler will depreciate  so much in the first 3 years that  you will get little when its time to trade it in.I think @Cavell is thinking about the old Pacifica, not the newer minivan that uses the same name.
Edmunds estimates the maintenance for the 2020 Pacifica at $3849 for the first five years. They estimate the 2020 Sienna costs at $5083 for the same period. Pacifica repairs are expected to be $994 and Sienna repairs could be $797. You can read about how they calculate their estimates at Edmunds.com, True Cost to Own. The repair costs are skewed low because they have the full factory warranty included. You could use the ratio of the two to estimate repairs for later years. You might also look at repair costs for older, out of warrant Siennas and Pacificas to get a better idea, but 2020 is the first year for the Pacifica AWD minivan. Again, a ratio of 2WD vans could tell you how much more repairs might be on a Pacifica.On Carcomplaints.com, the Pacifica/Town and Country is worse than the Sienna:
https://www.carcomplaints.com/Chrysler/Pacifica/
https://www.carcomplaints.com/Chrysler/Town_Country/
https://www.carcomplaints.com/Toyota/Sienna/Wife  has a 2014 Grand caravan which uses the same engine as the Pacifica  and the only issues in 105000 miles has been a cracked oil cooler which was under warranty   and now it has a check engine light on and it is a  P0128 code which is going to be  a thermostat  .   I think the Pacifica uses a 9 speed auto versus the 6 speed in the wifes car    which has less than stellar shift characteristics   but it has not had  any issues so far  .    Myself I run the same engine in my 20  Durango behind a 8 speed auto and it is one of the best engine transmissions setups I have driven .  Have about 11000 miles on that  , no issues .   Quality wise I have not seen any major issues with FCA’s  products .  Most makers have reasonable quality if you take care of them .  If 2020 is the first year for AWD on Chryslers  mini then I would give them a year or two to get the bugs out .


 galant:

FWIW motortrend ranked the Pacifica as the number one minivan


I haven’t really paid attention to Motor Trend as a serious source of independent automotive journalism since it became obvious that Car of the Year was most likely based on how much money a company gave the magazine. I mean, the Caprice Classic got it in the 90’s, and the freaking Citation got it in 1980.


 shadowfax:

I haven’t really paid attention to Motor Trend as a serious source of independent automotive journalism since it became obvious that Car of the Year was most likely based on how much money a company gave the magazine


Some Motor Trend’s most famous cars of the year.
1971 Vega: The Vega is listed as one the top 2 most unreliable vehicles ever built.
1983 Renault Alliance: Another extremely poorly built and designed vehicle.
Motor Trends car of  the car goes to the highest bidder. Sometimes it matches with a reliable vehicle.I wouldn’t worry much about maintenance costs on a new vehicle. And repair costs are covered by warranty. But I see nothing in the post asking about new/used.I think the ‘stow and go’ option isn’t available with AWD on the Pacifica.It has to be new. This is the first year for the AWD Pacifica.
When we were looking for my wife’s minivan, I drove a Pacifica hybrid and she drove the non-hybrid Pacifica. They are quiet, comfortable, have good power, and good handling for a minivan. We liked the storable second row captain’s chairs too. We ended up with the Odyssey because she felt better about a Honda vs. a FCA product, and the second row had to stow or come out. The Pacifica was new in 2017 and hasn’t been around long enough to work the first model year kinks out and show long term reliability.
There are 63 complaints for the 2019 Pacifica at safercar.gov 1 and 17 for the Sienna. The 2019 Sienna is the 9th year of the third generation. This is the first year for the fourth generation Sienna and there are 3 complaints at safercar.gov 1 while the 2020 Pacifica has six.  It’s still early in the model year and the gap could grow or shrink.@shadowfax; I get the the motor trend for free from a friend. You are right about their ratings. The part that is helpful is fine print. When they report something like harsh shifting, you gotta know the transmission is a disaster. Also, the long term review could be revealing. Like the car of the year being back to the dealership 6 times for a leaking sunroof.
@COROLLAGUY1; I had a rental RAV4, 2019. The transmission shifting was horrible, radio screen resolution dismal,  engine noise galore. And I am used to Hyundai cars. Had a 2018 RAV for a while too. The torque converter was very whiny and the dealer didn’t want to do anything. The acknowledged the problem, but said Toyota says to keep driving it for now. It was a CPO and I had them buy it back from me. I lost the tax and registration fees, but I might live longer.
Having said that, when in doubt, if you buy a Toyota, at least you know if you don’t like it, someone will buy it from you for a decent price.So, I am reading one issue of the motor trend. There is the long term review of the 2018 Pacifica. They say it is a good car, BUT had been in the shop for one month because they had a no start situation and the dealer couldn’t figure it out. Then the heater stopped working along with some other problem. The 2018 has the Stow and go, but the 2021 with AWD would not have this.
I am not sure the Sienna is better, but OP might also want to look at the Kia Minivan.",,,,

TesterIf it were me, I would go back in and recheck all of the timing marks. Since it’s an interference fit engine hopefully if there is a timing mark error it’s not more than a tooth off. Much more can lead to cylinder head valve damage and loss of compression when intake valves hit piston tops.
If valve damage is present it’s quite possible this could happen in a split second upon startup and not even be noticed. Hopefully that is not the case.

667,Nissan Titan starting issues,Maintenance/Repairs,2,138,"I am looking for a little advice regarding my 2010 Nissan Titan.
Here is the back story
I began having issues with it turning over and not starting from time to time. I needed to change the battery and ironically it started fine for about 2 weeks then the problem came back. Finally it happened more and took me sometimes it took me a while to start it. Then nothing.
I towed it to a electrical auto place which they traced it to the ECU. So I sent it off to be refurbished which they told me it couldnt be repaired so the to another refurb, programmed it and I got it back today. I tried for about 10min and nothing. Then is started yet sounded sluggish for about 3 seconds. Turned it off again and it didnt work. Got it started and let it run for a while so that part is fine so I am assuming that issue is fixed.
So here is the new issue that I question. Before this happened it turned over quick but when I got it back from the electric place when it turns over it had a deeper tone that different. Now when it starts it takes a 1-2 seconds over turning over to start.
For anyone that knows can you suggest a list of easy inexpensive things I can throw at it? While is seems “OK” something is still off.Did you try cleaning up the connections on the starter  end   ?Sounds like the battery is a bit drained. If you drive this truck every day, I’d suspect you have a parasitic drain. Aftermarket radios, subs, alarms or remote starters as junk and will partially fail by pulling too much current from the battery even when off. If you have any of those, unhook or pull the fuse for each of them for a few days and see if this improves.",,,,

If the cyclist ran the red light, then his failure to follow the law is the proximate cause of the collision.

“What is the supposed evidence that the cyclist ran the light?”


The bicyclist’s helmet-cam video?
Denver bicyclists are notorious forunning RED signals and STOP signs.
Wife and I also do.n our tandem - if such does not affectraffic having the right-of-way.I re-ran the vid several times and couldn’t see a red light.The cyclist edited that video.  There is about 20 seconds missing.  Possibly cropped as the it looks like the focal length changed between the segments.
Since they were going at 90 degrees to each other, one of them certainly ran the red light.  All you see in the first segment is his handle bars so either the helmet cam wasn’t aligned with his view of the road, which is unlikely, he wasn’t watching where he was going or he cropped only the bottom of the clip so the traffic light would not be shown.Don’t know if it is hit and run, or maybe the driver was asking if you are ok and the cyclist said yes, too little info.",,,,
669,Stuff dishonest car dealers used to put in the oil of worn out engines?,General Discussion,71,40.4k,"I overheard some friends talking about buying a used car.  One said to make sure that no one had put sawdust or banana peels in the oil!  Now I had heard this statement or something similar years ago and had forgotten.
My question is how would this help or mask the symptoms a tired worn out engine?  All I can see it doing it plugging the oil pump pickup and locking up the engine?  I guess all this stuff could help plug leaks in gaskets/seals to mask an oil leak but what good would this really do?  Is this just an old saying or was this actually done at one time?  I can see it maybe working on an engine without an oil pump (really old) but cannot see it doing anything good, even in the very short term, on a modern engine.I know people who have added various additives to their engines that burned oil or had worn bearings and made more noise because of this.  They were mainly just thicker oil to mask the extra large clearances.  One issue with this in many modern cars is that the valve lifters and timing in many new cars requires a very specific range of viscosities as well as very clean oil.
I honestly feel that one of the main reasons you don’t see so many mass polluters driving around anymore is that modern engines cannot run in such poor condition because of all the sensors and hydraulic systems in the engine.  If an engine starts burning oil, it simply won’t run very long before something gets fouled.I think the sawdust and banana peels were for old worn manual transmissions, to cover up the sound of grinding gears, not for engines.  I remember an old (well, they’re all old) episode of the Andy Griffith Show where Barney thought he got a “great” deal on a used car, until it started acting up and they discovered sawdust in the transmission.This makes more sense than a pressure lubricated engine.
I recently had a manual transmission that was acting funny.  2nd gear synchro was shot and it would sometimes pop out of gear, especially 3rd, when you hit a bump and it was under load.  Between this and the fact that the clutch needed replacement, I got another good transmission to swap in.  I found some sheared off screw heads from the bearing retainer when I drained the fluid.  I suspect that I found the source of many of the problems.
I guess this is basically like some of the cars I have seen where the cooling system is filled with some type of stop leak.  They should outlaw that crap.I have no doubt that just about everything imaginable has been tried as an additive at one time or another. I’ve heard of countless things, including sawdust for transmission. We get an occasional odd recommendation on this forum.
I agree with your conclusion that these “additives” cannot do good, only harm. I also agree with your post of 10:23AM.The most interesting additive that is actually decent was a suggestion by a transmission guy here to use Berryman B12 in automatic transmissions.  He runs it all the time but I put it in one that was getting “clunky” and then had the fluid and filter changed.  I wanted to dislodge all the crud right before the change and the transmission shifted smooth as silk afterwards.
One that seems to actually work in the oil for freeing suck rings and lifters in neglected engines is Marvel Mystery Oil.  I know others just add a few ounces of Diesel and it does the same thing.The sawdust and banana peels seems to be more for rear ends that are howling
Put it in, and if it’s quiet long enough to sell the POS, mission accomplished
That’s what I hear, anyways
I think I would have trouble sleeping if I pulled a fast one on somebody, like that
What’s scary is that some of the guys that tell these stories, the way they smile, their eyes glaze over, and they laugh, it makes you think they’re the ones that were doing it.  And maybe they wish they could still get away with itHere’s what happened to Barney:
""Barney makes the decision to buy a car for the first time. He sees an ad in the paper that sounds just like what he’s looking for and when the seller comes to Andy’s house, he’s more convinced than ever. The vendor is a little old lady whose husband has recently died. She claims the car was only ever driven a low speed and that it just breaks her heart to sell it. Andy advises caution and suggests that he have Wally the mechanic give the car a once over but Barney won’t hear of it. The old woman has him wrapped around her little finger so tight that he even overpays for the car. Not surprisingly, the car breaks down the next day when he take her out for the first time. When Gomer checks it out, he finds saw dust in the transmission, used to keep it all running smoothly for a few days and a sure sign he was taken for a ride. They soon find exactly what that old lady has been up to. ""Keep in mind this phrase “Only in the movies”.  In this case, only in Mayberry.  TV writers are not mechanics.
I have never  heard of anyone doing (or finding) the sawdust trick in the real world, and I’ve been in it for a while.  Anyone else?
I do recall my father telling a story about a guy he knew in the '50s who had a worn out babbit beater Chevy.  He dropped the pan, took each bearing cap off and “packed” them with ham rind.  Then he towed the car to within a block of the Chevy dealer.  He only drove it that very short distance and traded it in.  Of course the dealer discovered it as soon as they sent the trade out for it’s first test drive, and subsequently dropped the pan again.  Of course that wasn’t a dealer trying to fleece a customer.I’ve heard that from other places in the '60s. So if it’s just a story it was widespread.I remember back in the 80s running across a rear differential that looked like it had been packed with something to quieten it down although I don’t think it was sawdust. It was a trade-in and the boss sent it back to service where a rear differential leak was discovered. In the course of fixing the leak this unknown substance was discovered. Once repaired and with fresh fluid it seemed to be fine.
Of the dealers I’ve worked for over the years I’ve never known one of them to stuff sawdust into a differential or STP Oil Treatment in an engine to muffle noises.
However, I’ve seen a lot of trade-ins that the owners have doctored before unloading them on the dealer.
The worst one was the car with the missing engine and transmission.Back in the 60s and 70s, I too often often heard discussions about using sawdust or bananas in manual transmissions or rear differentials to quiet noises.  This was usually done prior to selling the vehicle.
This was not limited to car dealers.  Individual private sellers did it as well.The second car I bought when I was young and foolish, was from a little old lady in a cottage with a white picket fence around it.  It was a 54 Plymouth that had just been repainted Petty blue.
She was so charming and the car seemed so nice that I didn’t even look under it. The only problem I saw was that the seat wouldn’t slide but I figured I could fix that.
The next week I was driving and the u-joints started clunking and I looked underneath and saw the joints were wrapped with grease filled burlap with wire coat hanger twisted around the ends.
I saw why the seat wouldn’t slide, the floor was made of flattened large paint cans welded together with the seat frame welded to them.
When I changed the oil it came out glug, glug like 90 weight gear oil.  Two months later the bearings went.
The moral os the story, buy the car, not the story.I remember hearing more than once, the use of finely ground oatmeal or pepper to plug a radiator leak, but never really saw anyone really do it. I guess that it would flow to the leak and swell as it cooked and would plug the hole.
I might try that if I was stranded out in the desert 100 miles from nowhere and had to rely on my own wit to survive.
I avoid even the marketed stop leaks and additives. I think they do more harm than good. I did use some stop leak for a plow truck this fall that had a small head gasket leak. I know it worked, or at least helped for the short time. The truck is a rust bucket and too many problems to fix, so I know it will be replaced before next years plow season.
I bought a car once that I had even looked under the hood before paying for it, but somehow missed the recent repair. Someone had needed to replace the ground cable from the battery. They had straightened out and twisted three lengths of coat hanger to make the wire from.
Yosemite@oldtimer–your story of the 1954 Plymouth and the heavy weight oil in the crankcase reminded me of an experience when I was in college.  Several of us were coming back to campus with one fellow who owned a 1950 Pontiac.  About 15 miles away from campus, a connecting rod started knocking.  The driver pulled into a service station and we filled the crankcase with 90 weight gear lube.  We push started the car and the heavy oil got us back to campus.  The next day, a wrecker hauled the Pontiac away to the junk yard.I believe that was a black 52 or 53 Ford that Barney bought.  Then later Aunt Bea bought that nice 56 Ford.  I like to watch the shows just to look at the old cars.
Around here we had one guy that it was suspected of using saw dust.  He had a used car lot.  We used to call him J C Bob because every car you’d look at he’s say J C its just like brand new.
Coat hangers on U joints?  That’s a new one.  I mean U joints are pretty cheap.When I was cook at Holiday inn in college,I bought a car from a hotel maintenance guy who had a sideline of used cars. Was disappointed when I found masking tape over rust holes spray painted the proper color, and the engine blew within a year. As Wierd Al says, I’ll be laughing my butt off while he is roasting in hell. (amish paradise) a bit into the song. One of my favs if you want a watch here it is! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOfZLb33uCg 46Ah, “Weird Al” Yankovic, my favorite artist. You know he’s outlasted many of the artists he’s parodied over the years. I’d say he certainly belongs in the Rock N’Roll Hall of Fame.
I have all three of Tom & Ray’s Disrespectful Car Tunes CD’s and I’m disappointed they didn’t get at least one Weird Al song on there.  “Stop Draggin’ My Car Around” comes to mind as appropriate.On Board with that @Ed_frugal !Back in 1962 just after my sister married, my Brother in Law got a body shop job at one of the dealers in St. Paul on University Ave.  I think it was a Ford dealer.  He had worked previously at the local Ford dealer body shop so was experienced and did/does nice work.  He quit when they wanted him to use tape over rust and then body filler to make it look nice.  That was back when all the cars had rust holes on the fenders, doors or wheel wells.
Of course then there was that aluminum tape that was pushed for rust repairs.  I tried it but it didn’t last.  Of course the best was welding in new metal or second best, fiberglass in my view.  I think it was a pretty common practice back then.  That’s why you used to need to go over the common rust areas with a magnet to detect if there was filler in there or not.",,,,
670,Dodge dakota ac/heat,Maintenance/Repairs,6,210,"Hello,
I have a 2000 Dodge Dakota 3.9l V6…
When I turn the AC on the truck shutters and doesn’t blow cool air. It almost stalls.
Still problem occured a few months ago so through the late Summer and Fall I just haven’t been using the AC but now it is getting cold and I need the defroster/heat.
i went to use that today and the the truck did the same thing.
I thought the heat and defroster wouldn’t be effected since it was the ac compressorSome HVAC systems automatically turn the AC on when set to defrost.
Unplug the compressor clutch electrical connector to see if the problem goes away.
TesterThe compressor kicks in when you’re in defrost mode.The a/c compressor runs in defrost mode.Sounds like the compressor is on its way out  and when it engages  it is putting a heckuva load on the engine  when it engages  .    Most Dodge products do indeed run the compressor when  the setting is  set on the front windshield  (defrost)  .   It should not engage  in a normal heat setting  thru the front outlets or the floor .If you are tight on funds, you can maybe use a substitute belt to bypass the ac. Sure everybody says it is needed, but my frst ac car was 1993, 22 years without ac for defog worked fine for me.I removed the AC clutch relay and the defrost and heat work fine without any stalling.",,,,
671,2016 Corolla Shaking and accelerating issues,Maintenance/Repairs,8,361,"Hello. I have a 2016 Toyota Corolla L 39,000 miles. 1.8l engine.
I have no check engine light on.
Back in early Summer the car was not accelerating very well when going up hill and when first starting out into traffic. Thought it might be ac and the heat but now we have much cooler temps and no ac running and the car sill accelerates poorly at times. Not like it was with ac on max but still not what I would consider normal.
Car has also began being much more shaky and bumpy. I can really feel it in the seat. Not so much in the steering. I had new tires put on thinking that might have been the problem and they needed them anyway. Not the tires…the shaking and bump is still there. No issues with ball joints, etc. from moving tire up and down. Things seem good there. no abnormal tread wear on tires.
Also when stopped and idling with foot on the brake (red light or drive thru line) The car make some vibration in the brake pedal and a light noise coming from engine.I feel like i’m in a roller coaster at times. If I prop by leg towards the door you can see my leg skaking and it is very annoying…I am assuming a issue with spark plugs would have thrown the check engine light?I rarely see issues with a Corolla at this low milage.You need to take your car to the dealership or an independant mechanic that can diagnose the car properly.I’m wondering if the problem could be related to the VVT system.
VVT problems can arise from using the wrong grade of oil, and are frequently caused by failure to change the oil often enough.
If you are driving less frequently nowadays–as most of us are–are you changing the oil on the basis of elapsed time, rather than on the basis of odometer mileage?Does your check engine light come on when you turn on the key but don’t start the engine?
It is just a gurss given your vauge symptoms but it sounds like you might have a vacuum leak.I will check some of these things out. Is the Corolla known as having a rougher ride?
The cars I am use to driving have been older V6. Perhaps the ride just isn’t as smooth since it not as heavy.
The braking/engine shaking is intermittent so hard to really feel it long enough.We leased a 2015 civic, even had cvt… It rode fine. Certainly ok at highway speed. I would be surprised if you think a newer Toyota/Honda 4cyl would be lacking in acceptable ride and have meager performance. Blaming the issues on 4cyl vs 6 cyl? Something is wrong with your car.Does this use a CVT tranny  .  If you aren’t used to it they can seem  sluggish and not refined compared to a normal transmission .It has a stand 4 speed automatic trans. No CVT. I purchased it without that purposely after hearing some poor things about that type of transmission. not necessarily with Toyota but in general with CVT.
I just think of older model say my last car a 2004 Taurus which was a V6 and much heavier to be a smoother ride which is what I meant in 4cly vs V6. It was older and the same as the 90’s model.
That versus the 2016 corolla to me is lightweight and more fuel economic…Just thought the ride would be less smooth. I have also heard Camry’s ride much smoother than the corolla and read some reviews about corollas being a bit bumpy.
I am just trying to figure it out on my own and looking around. At only 40K miles I was hoping I wouldn’t have any shaking.engine performance issues yet with the reliability of Toyota.
I don’t like going to the mechanic. You never know if what you need is what they are telling you…and tampering for repeat business. You just never know. I guess you have to trust one some time or another but I try to figure things out on my own to start.",,,,

675,Exhaust Noise Only When Accelerating After Catalytic Converter Replacement,Maintenance/Repairs,9,14.4k,"I have a 2005 Honda CRV LX. I replaced my catalytic converter with an aftermarket one I found on Amazon (https://goo.gl/GTBnjD 36). The check engine light came on for the converter and I took it to a shop that confirmed it needed to be replaced. I had also been smelling fumes for some time which was probably due to the corroded connection at the back of the catalytic converter. And it was a little noisy. It came with a flex gasket for the manifold, but it didn’t fit. So I bought a better one from Autozone (https://goo.gl/cL4iAP 34). It seemed to fit well. The spring bolts came with the converter and installed without a problem. I also replaced the spark plugs (same NGK Laser Iridium that it had in it) and air filter while I was working on it.
When I started the car after I was done, it was much quieter while idling. Even while revving the engine in park, the exhaust sounded great. However, when I actually drove it, it was quite noisy while accelerating. Quiet while coasting. Only during accelerating did it make noise. I also don’t notice any exhaust fumes.
I’m stumped as to what the problem is. It sounds like an exhaust leak, but there are no other indications of a leak and it’s quiet as can be when the car is not in motion. Any thoughts?You might try checking for an exhaust leak the old fashioned way. Stick a potato in the exhaust pipe and start the car. Don’t rev the engine, just start it. If you hear a hissing sound and the engine is still running you do, indeed have an exhaust leak. I’d suggest the flex coupling between the engine and the cat as you may have finished it off when you replaced the cat or possibly the cat’s seal itself is a mis-match.
If the engine dies right away with no hiss, then there is no exhaust leak. Restart and rev engine and the potato should come shooting out the pipe. If that happens, the likely problem is that the cat you bought is not as good a muffler as the original equipment cat. You choices then are, ignore it, replace the muffler or add a additional bullet-style muffler between the cat and the muffler.Thanks!  I’ll give that a try.  There is no flex coupling per say.  There is a donut/flex gasket that fits over the manifold pipe and the flange of the cat is pressed against the gasket with two spring bolts.  The only thing I can think is that the springs are not stiff enough to keep the joint closed under the exhaust pressure when accelerating.  I assumed that revving the engine while in park would produce similar pressure to actually accelerating, but maybe not.
How much muffling does a cat provide?  Like I mentioned it’s much quieter than before at idle.  So I don’t think it’s the muffling ability of the cat itself.I have been thinking about this and I think the reason this is happening while accelerating and not revving the engine is because the noise is not he result of increased pressure due to higher RPMs.  Instead it’s caused by excessive rotation of the engine, leading to the flex joint (manifold to catalytic converter) opening more than it should.  My first thought is that it could be due to insufficient spring force.  The new springs may not have the necessary stiffness to hold the seal under load.  I may try adding some washers to compress the springs and increase the force.  I want to be careful not to increase it so much as to transfer the force further down the exhaust system where is it less able to tolerate the flex.
It also could be that the new bolts are a little longer, or the new gasket is not as deep.  Either way it would be the same solution: remove the excess slack from the connection.
It may be that the engine mounts need to be replaced, preventing the excessive twisting of the engine during acceleration.  I don’t know much about that, but imagine it’s more work than I’m willing to handle, or want to pay for.
A third possibility is that the donut gasket isn’t tight enough around the manifold down pipe, causing the flex in the connection to   open more than it would otherwise.  I am considering using a bit of Permatex 80335 Muffler and Tailpipe Sealer around the gasket to help seal it up around the downpipe.What did you do, any updates? I have a similar scenarioAlso,. My replacement cat is noisy.  All the pipes up to the actual muffler were replaced but now car is much noisier…I might try wrapping the cat,. No leaks that I seeWrap cat with insulating tape I’m thinking…There is a leak in the exhaust, or the muffler is bad.
It’s a pleasant surprise: how much good work an independent local muffler shop can do for a very reasonable price.Just to be clear: if I’m experiencing greater noise, then the noise itself is the only actual “problem”, right?  There’s nothing else to be concerned with?  I just noticed the added noise when coming home from getting government-mandated emissions testing (my '97 GMC Sonoma failed emissions a few days earlier which is why I got the new cat) and it passed, so would that indicate that there isn’t an exhaust leak?  Or if there is, that the leak isn’t reducing efficiency?If you have noise you might have a leak, or the replacement cat might just have less restriction so it is less of a muffler than factory. Unless you check for a leak, you won’t know which it is.
And exhaust leaks can make you sick or kill you. That is why the outlet is far away from the passengers.",,,,
676,Mystery Grinding Noise 2014 Charger,Maintenance/Repairs,11,6.3k,"My husband has a 2014 Dodge Charger RT all wheel drive. We have been hearing this strange grinding noise from the front end. It only happens when you let off the gas. It is not there while accelerating. Two different Dodge dealerships can’t figure it out. Any help is greatly appreciated.That sort of sounds like a drive shaft, CV joint,   or trans-axle  problem to me.  Try experimenting to see if there’s any brake involvement maybe.  Drive it at a steady speed for example, then let off the gas and take note of the noise.  Then drive it at that same steady speed while applying the brakes a little, then let off the gas while still applying the brakes.  Any difference in the sound or how the car responds?
Next time your shop gets it on a lift, make sure they check for any unusual  play in the drive line components, the CV boots are ok,  and that there’s the proper amount of fluid in the trans axle/differential.   Nothing?  Sometimes a failing wheel bearing might cause this, so ask the shop to check for that.  Still nothing?  hmm … when you let off the gas it changes the suspension components configuration a little, so there’s a chance something is rubbing on the wheels due to the front end lowering as a result of the deceleration.  Ask the shop to look at the inside of the wheels for any unusual rubbing marks.Is it still under factory warranty? If not, do you have documentation the 2 dealerships could not diagnose the problem while under factory warranty?. If you do it is Dodge’s problem until properly repaired.Check brake backing plates


 sgtrock21:

it is Dodge’s problem until properly repaired.


I agree with sgtrock21. The dealerships may not want to find what’s wrong with your car until the warranty is over. Make sure you document that the problem thoroughly to hold Dodge accountable.


 Roger124:

The dealerships may not want to find what’s wrong with your car until the warranty is over.


That is a misconception, dealer employees are aware that a complaint can’t be dismissed when the warranty expires.
How many miles are on the car and what is the duration of the warranty?


 je_allen:

We have been hearing this strange grinding noise from the front end. It only happens when you let off the gas. It is not there while accelerating.


I’ll post this just in case @je_allen checks back here.
I’d have the dealer technicians check engine/transmission mounts carefully and look for any evidence of alignment problems or defects involving mounts.
I experienced a problem like this once that was difficult to locate. It turned out to be what I have described.
While accelerating, engine torque moved the engine/transmission just enough to make the noise cease.
However, while decelerating, lack of much torque allowed the engine/transmission to transfer noise and vibration through metal-to-metal contact of the mounting parts, to the car’s body.
CSA2014 AWD Charger: I have the same grinding noise. It’s happens when you let off the gas at about 1400 RPM. It’s driving me crazy. I changed the front axels, front differential, transfer case, the front and rear drive shaft couplers. I’ve taken it to two dealerships and three other mechanic shops. I’ve written the manufacturer to no avail. No one can tell me what it is? It started at about 51k miles and now have 60k miles on the car. It is really loud in cold temperatures. Does anyone know what this noise is?Tucson? You familiar with A mountain?I am back in the shop today, still looking for that noise. The shop says it travels up and down the drive train. Says it may be a differential, but doesn’t want to say for sure. I think it is somewhere in a universal joint or bearing. I’ve written the FCV Manufacturer several times, no reply. I think they are tired of my complaint. Anyone have any ideas?Keep complaining until they find a solution.AWD 2014 Charger: The mystery grinding noise was the rear drive shaft. I just changed the rear drive shaft and the noise is gone. Thank you BrakeMax! No more grinding noise. It’s been doing it since 51k miles. Now I have 62k miles.",,,,
677,Thunk when coasting at speed and then depressing gas pedal,Maintenance/Repairs,23,2.7k,"First off, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all who have responded in the past to my posts seeking advice. I very much appreciate your efforts to help. I tried searching the internet for this condition but could not quite get the search wording right. In this case I am driving a 2005 Ford Escape V6, and when I am cruising at, say, 40mph, and I lift my foot from the gas pedal due to traffic conditions, when I depress the gas pedal again I get a thunk. If I depress it VERY slowly, no thunk, Also, no thunk when accelerating from a stop. Sometimes, but not always, I get a thunk when the transmission upshifts.
As I am writing this, CarTalk suggests this post, which is very close to what I am experiencing: Feeling a “bump” in the gas pedal after coasting…? 9
I changed the right front hydraulic motor mount right after I got this car about two months ago. Have only been driving it regular for about three weeks. Besides motor and transmission mounts, might there be anything else that could be causing this condition? Again, no thunk when taking off from a stop. This happens at faster and slower speeds than 40mph.
Thanks,
JackI would say u joints are a possibility, but then again probably not, as I assume a 2005 escape is front wheel drive?Yes, it is a front wheel drive.OK… You replaced your front motor mount… which basically keeps the engine from rising up and out of your hood or “doing a wheelie” lets say…  Which direction do you think it tries to twist when you do the opposite?  How bout the side and rear engine mounts?
I’d look into them in a serious manner.  It wouldn’t be the CV joints because they usually dont manifest that symptom.
You can also do this test for bad mounts.  Open your hood… Begin in park… Put in Drive and hold the brake and cycle the accelerator.  On and off the gas.  Watch engine.   After that go from Reverse to Drive and give it a little gas in each gear.  You may just recreate the actual sound…if so… you found another bad mount.
Let us know.I certainly will let you know. After posting this I recall reading that you should not see daylight through the rubber bushing of the mm. When I was under the car a few days ago doing something else, I gave the mounts a look at and noticed daylight through one of them. I thought at the time that it was by design. Then read that it is not a good sign.  I will have another look at them as soon as all the other things that are demanding my attention are satisfied.Kind of odd, because most things that would cause a clunk during acceleration (bad mounts) should cause a clunk when taking off from a stop as well. If it happens at a certain speed, maybe it’s making the noise when it’s in a certain gear, or downshifting to a certain gear.Dont forget and transmission mounts as well. I can speak from experience that you dont always get a thunk when accelerating but you can just feel it. If you have a whole set of bad mounts you should see a good deal of movement just from changing from park into gear. I dont know about the escape but look and see if it had a bobble strut, a small shock that dampens the engine movement, they go bad too.This is an update on the problem described in the first post of this thread. I finally got around to inspecting the motor mounts and none look obviously bad. I enlisted the help of a neighbor and had him put the trans in reverse and drive from neutral and rev the engine with all the brakes on while I observed the movement of the engine. it seemed to move a lot when revved and held so I decided to measure the movement. From the extreme of reverse to extreme of drive I measured 1 inch of up and down movement measuring from the valve cover on the front of the engine to the radiator bracket, which is very close. Not sure if this is too much movement or just right. But seeing as how the mounts have 165K on them, I’m thinking maybe I should just replace them all. This thunk is actually something that is more felt than heard.
JackOne inch doesn’t sound like it should be a problem but lay your hand on top of the engine and re-enlist you neighbor’s help.What does laying my hand on top of the engine supposed to tell me?Didn’t I read your post correctly?. I understood that you FELT the thud more than you heard it.Oh, I see, yes, felt more than heard. That thunk only happens when I am going above 35 mph or so and take my foot off the gas and then reapply the gas. Since I last posted I asked my neighbor to go through the same procedure. This time I watched the front and rear mounts. They both have rubber bushings inside a round steel casing with a single bolt passing through a steel bushing in the middle of the rubber and connecting to the engine/trans. I could see the rubber flex up and down on both front and back mounts as the engine was revved up in both drive and reverse, but more interesting is that I could see the portion of the frame that the front mount is bolted to move.  I will get under the vehicle tommorow to take a closer look.Other possibilities to consider

something in the trunk or under the seat is rolling around, check especially spare tire area, jack
suspension components are stressed during acceleration, so could be a strut, strut mount, ball joint, etc
exhaust components move during acceleration also, so check cat, muffler, pipe supports

My Corolla makes a similar noise at times, more often after removing my foot from the gas pedal to begin coasting to reduce speed,   and I think it is coming from the rear strut area.I have devised a theory as to what is happening. The rubber in the motor mounts is fatigued, allowing more movement than when new. When traveling at freeway speeds, and the accelerator pedal is allowed to return to its resting state, the braking action of the engine, even with an automatic transmission, causes it to be torqued in the opposite direction from when the engine is supplying power to the wheels. When the accelerator pedal is once again depressed, the torque on the engine is reversed, slamming it from one extreme to the other. This makes sense, and based on that I ordered the front and rear mounts and will install them this weekend. I already changed the right mount. I will change the left mount or not based on what results I get from changing the front and back ones.Your thought is pretty much right on point.
The only other thing is that since this car is new to you, there may well be something somewhere that is loose and banging around.  I’d check to see if the spare tire is secured well, and stick your head on the floor and look under the front seats with a flashlight.  I once bought a car that had a thunk and it turned out to be a golf ball that had ended up in the space between the rear fender in front of the rear wheel and the side of the floor of the trunk.I am convinced that this thunk is definitely coming from somewhere along the drivetrain. The fact that it occurs under very specific conditions, for me, rules out loose stuff knocking around. It only occurs when going fast, accelerator is released and then reapplied. The reapplication of the accelerator pedal does not need to be severe for the thunk to occur. In fact, there is no descernible acceleration when reapplying accelerator pedal, so no sudden jerking movement of vehicle surging forward. Since the transmission is in overdrive at this point I would have to jam the accelerator to get it to downshift and get a surge of acceleration. But this doesn’t happen at all. The reapplication of the accelerator produces only a very gentle re-engagenent of power to the wheels, but the thunk occurs, nonetheless… unless I am excurciatingly gentle when depressing the pedal. Then it does not occur. But the main thing is that there is no descernible acceleration when depressing the pedal normally. This, in my mind, is what makes the motor mounts suspect.
Having said that I am not ruling out some other explanation, but I am certain that it is somewhere along the drivetrain.The only other thought I have is some sort of looseness at the top of one of the front struts.  The forces of acceleration vs. coasting would have effects on all the front suspension, both twisting forces and shifting of load from rear to front.Thanks for the suggestion, wentwest. I will check out the front struts. Motor mounts due Friday and I hope to get them installed ASAP.  What I fear most is that this problem is caused by some condition in the transaxle.Welp, I changed the front and rear motor mounts, but still have the thunk. The rubber on the rear mount was completely separated from the metal casing on one side. The front one was cracked in several places but still one piece, so not a total waste of time and money. Still have the transmission mount to change, but doubt that is the problem. The top of the strut towers are both tight. Since it is not a severe problem I will put it on the back burner for a few days.

Dodge Hellephant Crate Engine Production Finally Beginning After Quality Issue 1
The Dodge Hellephant crate engine makes 1,000 horsepower and 950 pound-feet of torque. The company charged $29,995  for them.





I have been lucky enough to test and drive on public roads a bunch of the modern Challenger Hellcats and most of the variants. None of them can put the power down in any meaningful way. They do well as straight line dragstrip cars. That’s it. The most impressive to me was the AWD Trackhawk. It was the only one that could accelerate out of a corner that I have driven. Even the lesser Hemi-V8-Equipped Challengers can break both the rear tires free at 40 MPH on a dry road if you pin the throttle.  I’ve done it multiple times.  These are fun cars.If it’s the same video i’ve found it was a crate motor. I believe one runs $15,000 give or take.

I just recently rented a Uhaul Chevy van with a V-12 engine, and I totally get what you’re saying. Empty, that thing had massive power, but being too top heavy to use it in the turns really took the fun out of it.


 Whitey:

Uhaul Chevy van with a V-12 engine,


Why do you think it was a V12? GM has never built a modern V12.Correct. GM’s last v12 was in a 1937 Cadillac. I seem to remember Lincoln having a flat head v12 for a few years in the late 1940’s.Closest thing I can think of is Ford had a V10 for a few years in their F350s.The Lincoln Zephyr had a flatty V12. 1936 to 42. I have seen a few at auctions. Pretty cool car and engine.


 Mustangman:

It’s what the badge on the front end said unless I’m misremembering it.A 6 liter V8 is the biggest available van engine until 2020 when they upped it to 6.6 liters. No slouch in the power department.  the 6 Liter puts out 341 HP, 373 ft-lbs. Probably the truck you rented had some big rear-end gears, 4:56 or more. That would give you house-pulling power.It must have been a V8 then.  Something on the badge made me think it was more.  Nonetheless, it was fun to drive it like a rental van when it was empty.If it was a Ford it could have been a V10.I figured it had a engine swap like this V12.

Started making a whirring sound on starting that increases with acceleration.   Ill be taking it in soon but curious what you all thought (and what the bill will be).  It otherwise runs fine.
Bonus question is about tired.  I have a slow leak in drivers front tire.  Its not as slow anymore and cold weather makes me have to add air every few days.  If I end up needing a replacement can I swap out one tire, two tires?  Prefer not to swap all four.
Thanks, you guys are awesome!The sound could be anything and just let the shop find it . And since no one will actually know what it is or where you are and what the shop charge is I would not even try and guess cost.
As for the tired ( Tire ) that is why tire shops exist and if it is not repairable it is always best to have identical tires on the same end of vehicle.Thanks for the reply.  Yes, I intend to take it to a shop and tire place.  Just thought I’d ask the people here who may have experienced it before, I assume you havent.  Thanks!


 Andrew-Shallcross:

Rather than take the word of anyone in this forum–or any other forum–you need to find out the “official” word from the vehicle mfr.   Your Owner’s Manual should have the necessary info.Well I was curious. I would likely have not just shown my mechanic the responses and insisted he follow them. Thanks.
Tough crowd. lol


 Andrew-Shallcross:

Tough crowd


Suggesting that you read the relevant portion of the Owner’s Manual equates to a “tough crowd”?
Really?No you’re totally right.If anyone else stumbles across this with a similar issue and is curious about potential causes (other than “see a mechanic”):
Turned out to be the Serpentine Belt Tensioner and Idler Pulley.  Replaced and its quiet as can be.  Total parts and labour about $425 Canadian.  Thanks!Sorry Andrew . whirring sounds will not always be the same as what yours was . You said you were taking it to a shop and they did just what shops do , they fixed it.
What about the tire , was it repairable ?For sure.  I like this site because when I have an issue its great to get ideas of what it might be (big or little).  Of course, Im always going to take it in, its just nice to have an idea.  Some issues Ive seen people experience the same thing and its obvious.  Just thought the answer to a general question being “how the heck should we know, go to a mechanic” was odd for a forum about discussing issues lol  No biggie.
Tire was actually repairable.  To me surprise, there was a small nail.  It surprised me because I had the slow leak for awhile and then actually did get a nail in it which was significant.  But I didnt know if it had just happened or was an older issue that got worse.  Garage repaired that but the slow leak persisted making me think it was something else.  Garage looked at it and said they found another very small nail had caused it.  Repaired it.  And due to the cold, I had been refilling air every day this week.  Its didnt lose any air over night so looks to be the cause.

If I was in the market for an electric vehicle, I’d look for something like a used Nissan Leaf or Mitsubishi i-Miev.If this Hummer is as “successful” as GM’s last Hummer was, they might have to go into receivership as a result of the cost of developing and trying to market this new vehicle.$100K-plus for a Hummer seems a bit pricy… Has the ability to run out of fuel hundreds of miles from the nearest road… And you can’t bring it any !I don’t think this truck would appeal to prospectors but there are millions of people that live in cities and can plug in every evening if necessary.I will be very surprised if it is in production for 5 years.

Sure, and a plug-in “city car” like a Nissan Leaf, or the now-discontinued Mitsubishi i-MIEV would be ideal for such a person.  A huge, heavy SUV with a huge price tag isn’t what most people need or want.

Manufactures study the purchasing direction of consumers, those who are likely to buy an eccentric vehicle are those likely to purchase an expensive electric vehicle.
The Ford Raptor is a popular vehicle on the streets in my area, those owners do not participate in off road races. Consumers will be drawn towards flashy vehicles, if the Frontier, Tacoma, S10 budget trucks were still profitable this would be the focus of manufactures.

The question isn’t whether or not there are some fools who would be willing to pay $100k for the Hummer electric SUV.  The question is whether or not there are enough of these fools to allow GM to sell enough of these vehicles to turn a profit–or even to break even on its development and marketing costs.  I can’t imagine that there are.  There weren’t enough fools willing to buy the previous iteration of gasoline-powered Hummer vehicles to keep them profitable.
I believe that the future of electric vehicles in this country is going to be as a “city car” or commuter, which really only needs a range of 100-150 miles, and that people will still keep a gasoline-powered car or truck for pleasure use.  If GM was smart, their electric SUV would have been something comparable in size to a 2-door Jeep Wrangler,  or the Geo/Chevrolet Tracker, perhaps available in 2WD and 4WD versions at price points ranging from $30k to $60k.  Lots of people would pay those kind of prices for a vehicle; not so many will pay $100k.


 bcohen2010:

A huge, heavy SUV with a huge price tag isn’t what most people need or want.


Have you driven on American roads lately? Huge, heavy SUVs are the only thing most people want. They only start thinking about downsizing when gas goes above 3 or 4 bucks a gallon.
And a Suburban starts at 50, and you can add 20 grand to that price with options. So when the “normal” e-Hummers come out they’ll be competitively priced. And as @MikeInNH pointed out, the Navigator is selling pretty close to the price of the Edition 1, and it’s not even electric.
I disagree that electric cars will be relegated to city driving only. Heck, you can already take Teslas on cross country road trips without much difficulty at all. We’re not terribly far from a future in which pretty much any electric car will have the same range as a gas car, and similar “fueling” times. And volume will mean the prices will come down to the normal range (they already are - the Hummer isn’t really any more expensive than a gas counterpart)  and at that point, the only reason to buy a gas car will be stubbornness.


 bcohen2010:

That’s already there. And car manufacturers don’t agree with you because everyone of them is working on 400+ mile range - which is more then most ICE vehicles. The problem right now is batteries. And there’s 4 battery startups I know of in the Boston area - each with a new approach to building a better electric storage device. The big companies are spending BILLIONS in new car battery research.Seth Meyers had a great line about the electric Hummer: Guys compensating for having a small Prius.

You forgot that not everyone has your sense of worth and that they may have $112,000 to spend on an EV Hummer with plenty to spare. If being different is your definition of a fool, you need to rethink that idea.
The EV Hummer is a halo vehicle. It’s meant to draw attention to GM electric vehicles. It might cost more to build than that, but for a halo vehicle, making money right out of the box is not the important thing.

683,Chevy Silverado Electrical Nightmare,Maintenance/Repairs,26,35.8k,"I have a 2007 Silverado 1500, purchased as “certified” used from a Chevy dealer and now with less than 40,000 miles on the vehicle.  It has two major electrical problems.


The truck intermittently loses all electrical power WHILE PARKED, even after being driven for many miles and then stopped for only a few minutes.
The door must be opened with a key rather than the remote fob and after electrical power is restored, the clock must be reset, etc.


WHILE DRIVING, periodically the engine cuts in and out, the door locks slam up and down, the interior and exterior lights flash on and off, the instrument needles slam to the stops, etc. All these things occur at a rate of about once per second.  Sometimes this is all preceded by the airbag indicator light flashing on and off a couple of times, as though the truck just wants to taunt me.


Generally, I’ve been able to get the truck going and to TEMPORARILY stop the other problems by shaking and re-tightening the positive battery cable, but after numerous dealer visits the problems continue to recur.
Twice in the last two years a dealer decided the problems were due to defective batteries and replaced the battery. I was told that all computer codes and electrical connections were checked on each dealer visit.  As the problems continued and two dealers were unable to observe or to diagnose the problems, I paid a second dealer to replace the positive battery cable ($200 parts and labor), thinking perhaps the problem was an internal cable short. Again the problems recurred.  (I’ve long since started to relate to Shatner / Lithgow in the Twilight Zone “gremlin” episodes.)
After many occasions of tightening the cable clamp on both the original and the replacement AC Delco cables, last week I finally broke the narrow soft metal bolt and had to travel to yet a third dealer to pay $10 for a replacement bolt just to get the truck running for the day.
I now believe the problem might be that the Delco positive cable clamp on my 2007 vehicle is both absurdly designed and extremely cheaply made. The small diameter vertical clamp bolt with the little ears designed to force the clamp around the post is made of cheap, soft metal and seems to lose proper contact with the battery post, even on a brand new battery, perhaps as a result of heat expansion / contraction and/or vibration.
Compare this style clamp to a traditional, simple clamp with a larger diameter horizontal bolt that DIRECTLY and very strongly closes the clamp on the battery post.
In researching this on the internet, I’ve found many other complaints of similar problems by other owners of GM vehicles. Surely GM must be aware of this issue.
I’d be very interested to know whether 2008-2011 Silverados and other GM vehicles have positive battery cable clamps with the same design (Rube Goldberg clamping to post by small vertical bolt that forces clamp over little soft metal ears) or if at some point the positive cable clamp has been changed to something different, perhaps the original style clamp that worked effectively on all brands of vehicles for the previous several decades?
I’m going to try to find a cable or at least a traditional style proper clamp (for the dual cable) to replace the Delco part as an experiment. However, if anyone, unlike my local dealers, has a better theory for why my Silverado has been unreliable, infuriating, and sometimes unsafe to drive for the last two years I’d like to hear it.
I emailed Chevrolet about this problem and received a return call from a non-technical person at a call center in another country, who basically told me to take my now out-of-warranty vehicle back to a dealer for yet another visit. At this point, that was not a response I found helpful.
Now, for what may be the final insult, the truck has started occasionally and also randomly loudly “thunking” while smoothly accelerating in driving around town.  Of course, I’ll get the truck up on a lift to check U-joints, lubrication, etc., but I can’t help but wonder if the engine cutting on and off has damaged the drive train.  If so, now that the warranty has expired, that should be a delight for my credit card!Your Twilight Zone comment was good. Lets see if we can get you back to the ‘normal zone’.
First off, a lot of people make a mistake when they overtighten battery clamps. It makes problems rather than solve them. They should be snug enough so they don’t twist and that is it.
From what you have stated I think you are close to the trouble and it should be pretty easy to find. I suspect the trouble may be with the connection between the battery and power distribution panel under the hood or in the panel inself. You could try moving suspected trouble areas around while monitoring the power to the panel using a test light probe. Using a screwdriver handle to tap on things with may help locate the trouble faster. Check the chassis ground lead also.Thanks very much for the reply. I’ll follow up on your advice. And yes, absolutely right about tightening battery clamps.  In my case, I was sort of led down a path toward over-tightening and eventually breaking the pitiful little vertical bolt after many occasions of power loss and after the positive cable was replaced by a dealer and the problems began again before I made any additional adjustment or tightening.
In researching this I’ve found many, many, people with similar and even more bizarre electrical problems on GM vehicles.  Of course, all brands of vehicles have problems,  but there is definitely a pattern indicating some very poor quality control, if not design, at GM and especially AC Delco.  The only other person I know well who has a GM vehicle (Avalanche) has also had a long and infuriating history with electrical / electronic problems.
This was my first GM vehicle in over 20 years and it will probably be the last in my lifetime.  My truck developed some additional, probably unrelated, problems yesterday.  I just hope I can get the various problems solved to the extent that I won’t feel like a heel when I trade this truck for a non-GM product.  That will be a happy day!“Just tight enough that they don’t twist” is exactly right cougar. Of course having a clean cable end and battery post is necessary.Again, just for the record, the present positive cable on my truck’s battery post (entirely clean with both new cable and a new battery) was dealer installed and presumably “just tight enough so that it didn’t twist.”  Still the electrical power failed repeatedly and could be immediately, if temporarily, restored BY TIGHTENING THE CLAMP.
And by the way, at the time these problems began in earnest the first person to suggest that the clamp was too loose and should be tightened was the dealer’s service manager while I was talking to him on the phone.  He might still remember the horn blasting over the phone after I followed up with a 10mm wrench in one hand and the phone in the other.
However, long story short, yesterday for the very first time the truck’s power shorted out and then recovered all by itself while sitting in my driveway.  I know this because when I got in the truck it started but the clock showed 1200 when it was about 230.
This makes me now think that the problem is not in the cable but elsewhere, and I’ll be following up on Cougar’s suggestions as well as ideas I’ve heard on gminsidenews.com 61 and elsewhere.
In any event, I wonder if anyone can tell me, or even offer a good possibility, as to why the design of the clamp was ever changed from the traditional, reliable, simple, horizontal bolt to close a horizontal clamp to this Rube Goldberg apparatus having a small vertical bolt and a flat base with, as the dealer’s parts man put it, “two tits and a stud on it.” (For greatest accuracy, employ a Slim Pickens voice when you say those words.)
Was there really some functional reason for this design?
What was the motivation for the change?
What was actually accomplished, beyond a greater likelihood of failure?If twisting at the cable end often results in restoring current the problem may be the crimped connection at the cable end.Like a lot of things that get changed from the old reliable method or design the new piece is most likely cheaper to produce and so it makes more profit for the company.
I assume the battery that was changed out was the large main cable that ties to the starter and has the battery clamp on it. The cable that needs to be checked is the smaller one that ties to the power distribution panel under the hood along with the chassis ground lead from the battery.Also, if not mentioned already, there are often 2 positive cables with the cable ends stacked and a spacer between them. The plastic insulation and the spacer often get out of line and cause poor contact.After reading the post I am leaning towards a door lock and anti theft combo problem.The cable(s) changed included both the larger and smaller cables on the positive side.  Same problems before and after the cable change.  So except for the fact that tightening the nut on the vertical bolt (nothing else moves)  always restored power until I finally broke the little bolt on the second clamp, my theory about the problem being bad design and quality of the clamp would certainly be refuted.  And of course I know that there are surely many other owners who have had no problems with this clamp apparatus.  Maybe my truck needs an exorcist or a visit from Deepak Chopra?
Door lock /anti-theft problem?  That’s an interesting new idea!  Certainly every  time I’ve been standing over the battery when the power comes back, the alarm/horn starts blasting in my face until I can fish the key fob out of my pocket.  I thought this was just one more perk of owning a Chevrolet.  I’ll say one thing, the Silverado has a great horn!
But could a short somewhere in the door lock or anti-theft circuitry cause all the problems I’ve been having?  I guess it’s possible, now that I think about it.
I definitely agree with the cheaper component / more profit theory, Cougar.  In this case, though, I wonder how much cheaper a new design of a more complex apparatus could be, even if it’s made by Chinese workers who mold pot metal for 9 cents a day?  And if the component does cause reliability problems and dissatisfied customers, what sort of economy is that?  Of course, every one of us has opinions, informed or not so much, about this sort of thing vis a vis the U.S. auto industry…
I had to fly out of town and will not be able to pursue the truck problems until next week.  As I have neither the time nor a lift, I’ll be pasting and copying all the good suggestions received here and elsewhere and taking the truck back to a dealer next week with all of those ideas highlighted and a request to keep the truck until they can sort it out.  I’ll post whatever the result turns out to be.
Thanks for everyone’s feedback.Also, when I get back to the truck’s location, I’ll check both new new and old cable assemblies for the insulation and spacer set up between the two cables near the clamp.
That bit is hidden under the big red plastic cover, which also holds the little vertical bolt in place.
Thanks.It sounds as though you are completely losing batt power to the entire vehicle periodically.  This SHOULD be rather easy to figure out.  YOu need to go thru ALL of your electrical connections.  At the batt, at the fuse block under the hood…at the alternator…  AND DONT FORGET YOUR GROUND WIRES…
A faulty or loose ground will do this to you in one fell swoop.  Make sure your batt cables are cleaned and greased and tightened.  Same goes for any grounds… Also look for any broken wires…  This will probably be easy to sort thru with some patience.I have the same issue.I have a 2007 Silverado WT no power locks or any thing. I replaced the battery and both positive and negative cables with OEM cables from AC Delco. After replacing the battery I went a full month before the issue started again. It is as if the battery is completely disconnected. If I pop the hood and bump the battery with my fist power is restored. Two batteries and all new cables. WTF is going on?Have you checked your ground connection from battery to body?I checked both the ground to body and ground to block when i replaced the OEM cablesDoes this model have a junction terminal? If so, that could be the problem. It is usually located close to the battery positive terminal and will have a small cover over it.
The battery positive terminal will have 2 cables. One the main cable to the starter motor and a smaller cable routed to the junction terminal. If it has this, try cleaning the termnal and cable ends.
All electrical power except the starter motor windings go through that junction terminal and they can cause fine one minute, faulty the next symptoms.Is that the terminal with the big flat fuse in it? If  i will try cleaning it tomorrow, also thinking of running an additional ground to the chassis. Since the battery is a side post and top post can I run the additional ground off the unused battery post?Another idea, run a pair of wires from the engine compartment to the cab.  Then connect the side in the engine compartment to a place in the main power circuit that should be powered up when the key is in on.  And monitor that voltage with a volt meter (DVM) placed where you can see it while you drive.    You can move the take off point around from day to day, hopefully it will fail and you’ll have discovered a good clue to the cause.Which 2007 Silverado do you have?

685,1995 Chrysler Cirrus Auto Trans Control Module,Maintenance/Repairs,17,2.3k,"This car has had problems with the auto trans control module since new. Sometimes the problems are infrequent. Sometimes they are frequent. At 125,000 miles, all the mechanics agreed I needed a remanufactured transmission. After installing it, the control module was still frequently kicking the trans into “limp home” mode (2nd gear only). The problem was solved temporarily when they installed a different control module with that remanufactured transmission.

 Now that remanufactured transmission has about 50,000 miles on it, and the problem of kicking into “limp home” is behaving a little differently. In the morning when everything is cold, the trans kicks into “limp home” immediately. After driving three to five miles, I can switch off the ignition, re-crank the car, and the trans performs flawlessly the rest of the day. I’ve also noticed that while the trans is cold and acting up, the speedometer needle is also bouncing up and down. When the trans warms up and starts working, the speedometer also works properly.

 Do you think this is more likely to be caused by one of the speed sensors inside the trans? Or is it just another bad transmission control module?This is impossible to diagnose over the internet.  Since you’ve been having these issues since the car was new, why didn’t you resolve them while still under warranty?  With no mechanics able to make a definite diagnosis and repair I’d be extremely reluctant to pour much more money into this car.  Sounds like a prime candidate for cash for clunkers…It was repaired under warranty! Then re-appeared after the warranty expired. I was hoping to hear from other Chrysler owners who have had these transmission problems. I don’t think my car was an isolated lemon. And the problem doesn’t interfere with using the car. Just an annoying inconvenience so far. This Chrysler has been an otherwise great car.Have you considered upgrading from an automatic to a stick shift?
Just kidding.
Take a look at allpar.com 9 it’s a Chrysler only site. Someone there should be able to answer your question.With the speedo acting up, thats an indicator of an output speed sensor issue.  Have the speed sensors been replaced??
transmanI was hoping that the speed sensor was the problem and that it would be easy to replace. But the manual I found online indicates that these speed sensors are inside the transmission. Don’t know if the car is worth doing more internal transmission repairs.No, No…  you have a 604 Chrysler transmission.  Speed sensors are on the outside of the trans.  Heres a pic of the trans:
See where the dipstick tube is?  At the bottom of the dipstick tube and to the right is the input (Turbine) speed sensor.  Now directly to the right of the input sensor at the back of the trans is the output speed sensor.  Change both of these sensors.  They cost less than $50 for both of them.  A 1"" socket is all it takes.  If these have never been changed and you are experiencing limp mode and speedo issues, the output speed sensor and/or its wiring is most likely the problem.  You can pay a trans shop to do a scan on the TCM for codes to be sure.  But the speedo runs off of the output speed sensor.  I ALWAYS recommend changing BOTH sensors because they work together to shift the transmission.
transmanNow that’s good news! Exactly what I hoped to find. Thanks, Transman.Didn’t work did it? My 95 Cirrus just started doing the dance as well! I’m guessing it’s going to be the TCM. At least I’m hoping!I have the same problem - what was the fix?I have a 95 chrysler cirrus. Had same problem stuck in second gear limp mode. Replaced both speed sensors and still had problem. Took it to a shop 1200 bucks later a new shift solenoid and a tcm. Tcm was the main problem. Worked for a week then the thing went back to limp mode. Got a free tcm replacement now driving and working good. No idea if it will fry the tcm again or why. Looking for maybe electrical work to be diagnosed see if there is a short. Also wondering if the company that made these cars has a known defect that can be waranteed out or something…let me know. Thanks.
-MikeYeah, you can wipe away any thoughts of warranties on 25 year old car parts, Mike. The electronics in the car will become a greater and greater problem for you because they will fail solely from age. Eventually, there will be no replacement parts.

It is part Mercedes and part Chrysler so it might take time to find parts but if it not your primary transportation so what.I have a 2005 Hardtop with stick shift 180,000 miles so I can’t comment on convertible to or auto transmission but with regular maintenance it’s been very trouble free.
Maintenance includes oil changes every 6,000 miles (8 quarts Mobil 0-40 and top quality filter), coolant, brake pads (switched to ceramic because of dust buildup on wheels), serpentine belts and pullies and Iridium plugs at 90,000 miles. With basic skills and a $20 marine oil pump from WalMart easy and inexpensive to DIY.
Total repairs were replacement coolant pump (at mechanic) and cabin fan and resistor (DIY) at 100,000 miles. And with hardtops the headliner generally gives up the ghost @ 100,000 miles.
Mechanically these cars were built with parts bin bits from prior generation MB’s so these parts are easily available and reasonably priced BUT the body and interior were unique to this car and production was low so don’t bang it up, though you can find specialty parts recyclers on the web.

Not many sold, so you won’t find many folks with experience owning them.  Chrysler reliability overall hasn’t been great, but if you really gotta have it, and you get it inspected by a good mechanic that says it’s in good shape, then ok.  I’d rather get a Miata, if I fit.A friend bought one for his wife, manual transmission. She broke her ankle and would not be able to use a manual transmission due to ongoing ankle issues. They loved the car. 2005 is getting long in the tooth, but if you love it and don’t mind repairs for a 16 year old car go for it.Responding to texases, owner’s size is certainly a consideration but I think the Miata and Crossfire are actually aimed at different markets, with the Miata being more of a “Traditional British Sports Car” and the Crossfire being more of a “Cafe Racer”.
i.e. If I’m thinking about track events definitely the Miata but on a long cruise, probably the Crossfire.

687,Oil in spark plug cylinder 4,Maintenance/Repairs,28,704,"Hey guys,
A project car that my buddy’s been working on - a 2002 mustang 6 banger with 130k miles has been getting the cylinder 4 spark plug oil fouled. The fouling happens somewhat quickly. I’ll clean the plug or put a brand new one in and within a day or two it will be fouled again. None of the other plugs are fouling. Most of the oil appears on the threads but there is a small amount on the ground electrode. Generally this doesn’t cause too much drivability issues if the plug is removed and cleaned every few days but can feel a very small misfire under load if it goes too long without cleaning or replacing.
With a compression test done on the warm engine, the results showed 145 pounds in cylinder 4 which is a healthy amount. In fact it was even higher than the adjacent cylinder 5 plug pulled which was 140 or so. The car also doesn’t have blue smoke coming from the exhaust on startup or deceleration. So I’m pretty sure in conjunction, good compression and lack of exhaust smoke can eliminate the issue being bad valve stem seals or piston rings.
What’s more is that we did a smoke test by removing the cylinder 4 plug and blowing smoke in through the vacuum line and seeing if smoke would come out of cylinder 4 spark plug hole. No leaks - so this also eliminates a bad lower intake gasket. We also put a boroscope down cylinder 4 and there was no visible damage - and no oil inside the cylinder! This stumps me because the oil has to obviously be coming from somewhere…but there’s none in the cylinder!
The only obvious issue we saw was when doing the smoke test, a tiny amount of smoke was coming out near the pcv valve hose right where the PCV valve connects to the hose. Could this be the culprit of oil fouling in just one plug? I would imagine not, because wouldn’t that likely cause ALL the plugs to foul and not just one?
Other things I can eliminate and know aren’t the problem are a valve cover gasket (mechanic said in this specific car a leaking valve cover wouldn’t get oil in the plugs.) - anyone know if this is true? Also this engine doesn’t have spark plug tube seals so those aren’t a potential issue either.
Thoughts?Have you checked if the PCV valve is restricted?
TesterA 145 pounds of compression it NOT a healthy amount nor is 140. I suggest you go back and do a wet compression test on those cylinders. This means a small squirt of oil into the cylinder before the compression test is performed.
Compression ratio is roughly 9.3 to 1 so good compression will be 20 X times that; or 190ish.
For what it’s worth and to throw a monkey wrench into the works it is quite possible to have great compression (say 190) and still have a ring problem. The compression rings are good but the oil control rings are not doing their job because they are seized or have lost their temper;  meaning springiness.
Personally, I think the engine is done for and that if the wet test is performed you are going to see those 145 and 140 numbers take a jump upward; meaning ring/cylinder wear.The pcv is new and it rattles. The foam piece that connects the valve to the plastic hose going into the intake manifold is cracking. Would replacing that be the next step or would you say that has nothing to do with the issueI am having a hard time finding what “normal” compression is for my engine anywhere online. What makes you say it should be 190? I did find one mustang forum here


MustangForums.com 4

compression test and #'s ? - MustangForums.com 1





Those people on the Mustang forum are wrong. Dead damned wrong. Sounds like they’re repeating what they’ve read in Chiltons manuals which is as wrong as it can get. Chiltons can’t even get an oil pressure spec for a GM 3.8 right. They claim 6 PSI at 1800 RPM is good. Not in this universe is it good.
The general rule for compression numbers is to multiply the compression ratio X 20. Those figures will vary a bit based on altitude, barometric pressure, engine wear, humidity, and so on.I wonder if the valve stem seals on the cylinder are bad.Ah ok. I thought you would multiply the engines compression ratio (9.3) times atmospheric pressure (14.7) to find approximate compression level. Not multiply by 20?
In this case 9.3 x 14.7 = 136.71 which is normal?


 Mrnicefordguy:

bad valve stem seals or piston rings


Nope. Only eliminates piston rings and the valve seats themselves. You problem description screams valve stem seals on #4 out loud.That’s what I would think too except car is not exhaling blue or white smoke at startup or decel?No, it’s times 20.
I trained as a mechanic what seems like a hundred years ago and was taught to always run a compression test when  there is an engine performance issue. In some modern era cars removing the spark plugs is a bit of a nightmare so Options B and C come into play; which is a vacuum gauge or oscilloscope.
So over the years I have run no telling how many compression checks on just about anything with wheels and good compression is always in the 180s and up. The only cars I’ve seen in which 110 to 120 PSI is normal is on the old air cooled Volkswagens; as in the Bus and Beetle. Those figures are normal because the air cools only have a 6 to 1 compression ration.
One of my antique Harleys (flathead) has a 5 to 1 compression ratio and I would be lucky to get 90 PSI out of it.
I suspect that if you go back and run a compression test on all 6 cylinders on that Mustang you will find all of them  to be in the that 140  neighborhood and that a following wet test will cause a sizeable jump in every cylinder. The signs right now are that it’s dying.This website says no less than 100 PSI, dry.

Part 1 -How To Test The Engine Compression (3.8L Ford FWD) 2





TesterSpark plug tube seal?This engine doesn’t use those. I was thinking maybe valve cover gasket? But the mechanic said the way the engines designed a bad valve cover gasket wouldn’t cause plugs to foulI checked, yes you’re correct. A bad valve cover gasket would just cause oil to leak onto the side of the engine block.



 Triedaq:

I wonder if the valve stem seals on the cylinder are bad.


This sounds like the most likely cause.
You’re looking at removal of the cylinder head, and replacement of a buncho gaskets and head bolts, and buying some single use tools if want to diy.You don’t need to remove the heads to replace the valve stem seals.
Use the rope method.
HOW TO TAKE OFF A VALVE SPRING WITHOUT TAKING THE CYLINDER HEAD OFF
TesterMrnicefordguy, if/when you find the culprit please let us know. Because I hate it when an interesting thread like this remains a mystery.


 Mrnicefordguy:

Ah ok. I thought you would multiply the engines compression ratio (9.3) times atmospheric pressure (14.7) to find approximate compression level.


That would be ideal if you only did one compression stroke, there was no cam overlap and the rings and valves were perfectly sealed.
A normal compression test uses six compression cycles that builds up pressure in the compression gauge.  At six cycles, an equilibrium is reached and it won’t build up more pressure, or at least not significantly more pressure.
That is why 20 x CR is about right.  It can be a little lower with high compression racing engines because of the amount of valve overlap their cams have.I would like to know if the OP found out anything new about the problem.  I have a car with a similar problem, 4-cylinder engine with two cylinders around 150 PSI and two cylinders around 130 PSI, and the cylinder #3 spark plug keeps getting oil on the threads and electrode, causing a miss at idle.  The engine does not smoke or use oil, so I am trying to find out if this is something which can be fixed (worn valve stem seals, worn valve guides, etc.) or if this is something which would require too much effort to repair (worn piston rings/cylinder walls).  I did an oil change and added Restore to the oil, and it made no difference.",,,,
688,No headlights on 98 Protege,Maintenance/Repairs,9,281,"While driving at night with the low beam headlights on I noticed that the high beam indicator light was on, but very dimly lit. A few more night drives and the high beam indicator light would get a little brighter each time I would drive the car. Then both headlights stopped working simultaneously (no high beams either) and when I have the switch turned on for the low beam lights the high beam indicator light is fully illuminated. The side lights, turn signals, rear running lights, flashers and brake lights all work though. I’ve already replaced the headlight switch, tested the headlight relay and headlight fuse. So any idea what the problem could be?Sounds like a bad ground.Where’s the first place you’d check for a bad ground?There should be 3 wires going to each headlight socket,1 for high beam, 1 for low beam, and a ground wire. The ground is likely black with a stripe, but it could be some other color. Trace the ground back to where it attaches to the body.Is this the 1998 Mazda Protege that has all the rust . . . the one we advised you to get rid of quite some time ago?
If so, you may not be getting a ground through the rust . . . ?!
If that’s not you, my apologies
I’m bringing this up because you’ve obviously posted a few times before . . . and there are very few discussions concerning old Mazda ProtegesLOL. Yes, this is the car you’re talking about. But for being 22 years old and most of it’s life spent in a driveway/parking lot it’s really in pretty good shape. Not much rust at all.
So I went ahead and tried to trace the wires back but they run right into a hole in the body so I tried tugging on them to see if I could see where they come out but was unsuccessful. After that I decided to try the lights again thinking that maybe pulling on the wires improved the connection somehow and sure enough, the passenger side headlight came on. Both high and low beams. But here’s the thing; there was smoke coming from the plug (passenger’s side) that plugs into the bulb. There’s two red wires; one with a white stripe and the other with a black stripe. And then the third wire is black and the one that was getting so hot that it was melting/smoking the plastic plug. I looked closely and could see it’s metal plug was so far down on the bulb’s electrical connector that it was in contact with the little rounded tab thing at the base of the bulb. So I pulled the black wire’s plug back away from the base of the bulb and turned it back on and no more smoke. But the driver’s side headlight still doesn’t work at all. So If anyone understands what is going on here I’d greatly appreciate you filling me in. ThanksAfter looking closely at the bulb and applying common sense I don’t think the connector was too close to the base of the bulb. I’m now leaning towards the cause being corrosion of the black wire’s connector - creating high resistance/heat. I plan to clean up the connection and move the driver’s side bulb over to the passenger’s side to see if it is working and then go from there. Hopefully it’s blown but If it’s not… well, then I’ve got at least one other problem to deal with.You are correct in your thinking that the smoke was caused by a bad connection. Headlights require a significant amount of power to operate. Standard lights can require 55 watts of power. So even a small amount of resistance in the connection to the socket can cause heat to occur. You may have to replace the socket with a new one. I suspect the other light is out due to a ground problem also. You can supply your own ground from the light to the battery to prove it.


 db4690:

Is this the 1998 Mazda Protege that has all the rust . . . the one we advised you to get rid of quite some time ago?


After giving this more thought. No, I don’t think this is the same car. It doesn’t have all that much rust and I don’t remember anyone on here advising me to get rid of it. I don’t even think ‘‘rust’’ has ever come up in any of my previous threads. Doesn’t really matter one way or the other but just wanted to be accurate in my posting.
And another (insignificant) correction: It’s very unlikely that both headlights stopped working ‘‘simultaneously’’ like I claimed. The reason being is that each lamp had it’s own, independent ground problem. Based on that it seems very unlikely that they both went out a the same exact time. I must have been driving around with only the driver’s side headlight for awhile with no clue that the other was out.


 Cougar:

I suspect the other light is out due to a ground problem also


Yup, you nailed it. I went ahead and cleaned up all the connections on both sockets and bulb terminals and now the headlights are working very well.",,,,
689,2012 Ford Fusion - Recall on an auction car,Maintenance/Repairs,17,556,"Good morning… My sister has a 2012 Ford Fusion 4 door and it has an Electric steering that has gone out.

She has tough enough $$ for gas, let alone that amount of money. My question is :  Are they correct?as to what that ‘Auction’ represents? Can Ford do that? You can’t drive that car, and she can’t pay to fix. Any help would be very much appreciated. Brother MikeI guess Auction means the same as Salvage or Rebuilt in the place you are , where ever that is . And if that is correct then Ford has no obligation to repair it.
Try calling independent shops near you and you may get a better price .
Edit : Not positive but it seems that an 'Auction "" title is an open title and after sold the buyer needs to apply for a title in their name . Ford will not do any work , warranty or recall , to a vehicle with an open title .

Irrelevant. This is a safety recall, not a warranty issue. The situation is murky, at best. OP, your sister should escalate this up the corporate chain.

 GatewayAutoOmaha:

Most likely, if it has higher miles, the manufacturer’s warranty will be out


As NYBo noted, this is a recall issue,  not a warranty issue.  Warranties have a fixed limit, whereas recalls are… forever.
The joker in the deck, however, is whether the “auction” registration category in the OP’s state is equivalent to a salvage title.   If that is the case, then it could be difficult to induce Ford to pay for the needed repairs, but as NYBo also noted, this is a situation where it might be worthwhile to contact Ford at the corporate level.If “Auction” = “Salvage”, the OP’s state has picked a VERY misleading word.  Thousands of cars go to auction all the time, nothing to do with them being considered “salvage”.Once had a parts car. I don’t remember what it was. I got a notification for a safety recall for rupturing heater cores. I told them not to worry about it because the car was pretty much disassembled and would never see the road. They said that they weren’t going to take the chance. They sent a flatbed picked it up and changed heater core, bring it back. Not long after I scrapped it. Go figure.


 tcmichnorth:

I told them not to worry about it


Why even respond ?  Just put the letter in the recycling bin just like I did with a vehicle that has been totaled out .I think the OP left out an adjective; Salvage Auction.
If the recall had been performed in the past and it wasn’t necessary to replace the steering gear the vehicle would be eligible for a warranty extension on the steering gear of ten years/150,000 miles.
Salvage vehicles generally are not eligible for any warranty extensions.
""This safety recall involves reprogramming the Power Steering Control Module (PSCM), or replacing
the steering gear only if there is evidence that certain Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) exist or were
previously set, but are no longer present. If the steering gear is not replaced, the owner will be
provided extended coverage of the steering gear under program code 15N01 (See Attachment II
“LABOR ALLOWANCES”). This extended coverage provides for one-time replacement of the
steering gear if certain DTCs are present, for up to 10 years of service or 150,000 miles from the
warranty start date of the vehicle, whichever occurs first. If a vehicle has already exceeded the
mileage limit, this program will last through December 31, 2015 for eligible owners. The extended
coverage is automatically transferred to subsequent owners.""A vehicle cannot be denied a Recall for a salvage title. The sticky part to me here is a title that says auction on it. I can’t say that I have ever seen that although I am familiar with car auctions and so on.
Does the title actually state “Auction” or was that something she was told after the dealer checked Ford’s OASIS system?
Try contacting corporate Ford although I would not hold my breath while trying to get a straight answer.Like I said, I don’t know anything about this but the terms “warranty” and “recall” are being thrown around.  According to the OP this is a recall not a warranty.  It would not expire.  The title though may be an issue if they are saying it is “in between” owners and won’t do the work if there is no identified “owner”.  I’d bring the title in and try again and then take it up  a notch.  But in the case of maybe she didn’t register the title, better get that done.  BWDIK (but what do I know?)Because I had the other car that I was putting parts on from the parts car on the road that fell into the recall also.


 Bing:

Like I said, I don’t know anything about this but the terms “warranty” and “recall” are being thrown around. According to the OP this is a recall not a warranty. It would not expire.


The manufacture is only required to perform the recall one time, if this recall has been completed in the past the vehicle is not eligible for a free repair.
This recall adds a warranty extension for the steering gear, that expired when the vehicle was declared scrap. Vehicles with branded titles have no warranty.So lots we don’t know I guess.  What the “auction” title really means if it was salvage or not.  If the work was done before or not and if the resulting warranty expired or does not apply to a new owner.  Still rather than junking the car, it would be worth kicking it up the line.As a 1st time on click… I was unable to find the spot I put my comment on ! IThe response has been great… I need the community to know 2 things 1) mikage= 141k 2) Title reads ’ rebuilt salvage’ What are the thoughts on . Could I ask you to pass this on? Much appreciated MikeThe salvage title means that Ford no longer has to warranty any recalls and the age and mileage also remove the vehicle from Fords responsibility.
Just another story of why someone should not buy a Salvage vehicle .


 hawkeyemike1:

Title reads ’ rebuilt salvage’ What are the thoughts on


My thought is that “rebuilt salvage” is vastly different from “auction”, and as a result I have doubts that Ford will agree to pay for the recall.  However, it is still worth pursuing on the corporate level.There is no warranty on vehicles with branded titles; salvage, rebuilt, flood etc. Recalls still apply.
The link below is to the corporate level, enter the VIN, incomplete recalls that apply to that vehicle will be shown.

The other day when I tried to drive it, the car started, I was able to put it into drive, the engine will rev, but the car will not more forward. I tried putting it in reverse, the engine will rev, but again it will not move.
What kind of issue am I looking at?A transmission issue.
Check your transmission fluid level. My guess is that you’ve probably suffered a leak somewhere and the fluid is gone. Your engine is coupled to the transmission by a device called a “torque converter”. It’s kind of like a bagel cut in half and hollowed out with vanes inside. It’s filled with fluid, and as you start moving and the forward half of the device spins it drags the fluid along and the fluid drags the half that turns the transmission input shaft. My guess is that the fluid has drained out, and without the fluid inside the torque converter there’s no turbulence to pull the rear half of the drivetrain along.
I recommend having this towed rather than trying to drive it. You may be lucky and everything be in good shape once the fluid leak is fixed. The leak may be in one of the cooling lines or the tranny cooler rather than the tranny itself. You have a little radiator up front to dissipate tranny heat along with “lines” to move the tranny fluid between the tranny and the “radiator” (technically called a tranny cooler). If you fill it with fluid and try driving it, the fluid may drain as you drive and damage the tranny itself.Is your transmission fluid at the correct level?  Is it red or pink without a burnt smell?  Have you serviced the transmission properly all along?While I agree that the problem is most likely transmission-based, I want to give the OP another possibility, namely a parking brake/emergency brake that is not releasing.
Try shifting to neutral, and then seeing if you can get the car to move at all when you push it.
If it doesn’t budge at all, then your e-brake is frozen in the “on” position.
You would still need to get the car towed, but the fix would be much less expensive.
Please let us know what your mechanic finds when he checks the car.I will be an optimist.  Your gear selector in the car moves a cable which changes the position of the transmission range switch (a.k.a. neutral safety switch / PRNDL switch), probably on the top of the transmission.  If the cable or some of its linkage has come undone then your gear selector will move, but the transmission will remain in Park.
If the car is sitting on any kind of grade and didn’t move when you removed your foot from the brake then it’s probably still in park.  (Depending on the e-brake possibility noted by VDCdriver above).
You could pop the hood and try to get a look.  The switch is probably down underneath of a bunch of stuff.  Some are easily visible, some not so much, but they generally look about like the pic.  The rubber accordion looking thing is a protective boot over the cableThank you everyone! This model doesn’t have the stick that lets you check the fluid levels but I’m getting it towed to my mechanic today and I’ll update you all with what he says.
Before I do so I’m going to try the test to see if it’s my e-brake.Is your transmission fluid at the correct level?
Sealed transmission - no way of checking fluid.
My wife has an 07 Lexus ES-350 (same engine and tranny as the Camry V6). There was a service bulletin early on with the 07 tranny pump. The first few thousand built were having significant problems. They recalled those vehicles and replaced the pump. Haven’t heard about a single problem with the tranny afterwords - and it’s the same tranny used today in the Camry, Avalon and ES-350.hi. i have the same issue in my 2008 toyota camry. what did ur mechanic found out and how did ur mechanic fix it. hopefully to hear from u Miss Manual has not posted here in 6 years so I doubt if you will get a reply . Also her solution may not be the one for your problem .  You seem to have a transmission problem which is not really a do it yourself fix.  Find an independent transmission shop ( not one of those chain types ) and see what they have to say .",,,,
692,Expensive Fix Oil Leak Engine Lift,Maintenance/Repairs,13,925,"We have an oil leak that requires the repair person to have to lift our engine out of our Ford Ranger to repair the leak. This could be costly due to the amount of labor time.

 Has any one else had this situation?What year and how many miles?  If it’s a slow leak and the ranger is old and not worth much, I’d just keep topping it off.Have you tried the ‘high milage’ oils that are out there?  I understand they have additives to swell seals slightly, reducing leaks (maybe).  What is your leak?This is probably for the replacement of the oil pan seal, or the oil pan itself.  Please define “costly” with a number.  If you plan to keep the vehicle for a long time, it might be worth fixing.  What is the year and odometer reading of this Ranger?It’s a 1999 with 153,000. The leak is no longer slow. We have tried the ‘high milage’ oils and they have not helped. It is the gasket that needs replacing and we’re getting estimates of $900.
Thanks for your help everyone.Is the rest of the vehicle in good shape?  If so, I would get the repair done.  You might shop around to see if you can find a better price, but $900 sounds about right to me.Thanks. Yes it is in good shape. We will shop around. Thanks.What shop did you go to because we had the same exact problems but they’re asking for a big price of $3000 at shells service shop?

I don’t see that @Amarion mentioned a model anywhere in their post…(although you’re definitely not wrong in what you say!)@Amarion started his/her own thread in which he/she stated, “So we went to shells to see how much it would cost to fix the oil leaks of my bmw, they said it would be $3000”.   So, Steve was correct in regard to the make of car with the oil leak.ahh hadn’t read down that far yet Is it dripping on the ground? Is it making the oil level go down?
If not I’d wait until it gets worse.
I wouldn’t pay $3000 because of seepage.By Shells do you mean a Shell gas station? If so, you might take any diagnosis with a grain of salt.  While in high school I worked part time in a gas station and very briefly at another after graduation. The first was reputable; the second was a den of thieves and I got “laid off” after a couple of weeks because I refused to screw everyone who entered the lot to death.
Someone just needed a radiator cap? Nope; they needed all hoses, belts, thermostat, water pump, and quite often a radiator also. They would have fit right in with the 60 MInutes shock absorber scam going on at gas stations in Georgia.
The most expensive oil leak I can think of would be a rear main seal which requires pulling the engine but that should not run 3 grand.
You might provide make/model/year/miles of your vehicle along with the reason (or alleged reason) for the oil leak. That might help clear things up a bit.",,,,

Well that has been proven to be a lousy business choice .
As for you other questions there will be so many answers and opinions that all it will do is confuse you.
You did not say why you are asking but if you are a mechanic wanting your own business then look at what it costs to open a franchise type and that will show you that it takes lots of money to do this .Thank you for replying.
What is the lousy business choice?  Trying to get started out of a DIY garage?Tom and Ray of Cartalk fame actually started a Do it yourself shop and found it to be a not so good decision.
Those are for owners to work on there own vehicles .
There is no way I would let anyone work on my vehicle using a rental bay .  As for the mechanic , he will pay for the bay even if he does not need it all day , then more rental fees if he has to follow up warranty work , also have the bay tied up waiting on parts or going to rent some tool he does not own .
If you are a mechanic ( you don’t say if you are ) go to work for a good shop and just see what expenses there are .  Things like building lease , work mans insurance , property insurance , utilities  , advertising not to mention the large amount of money a mechanic has to spend on tools.To me it appears as if you are doing a marketing survey. Your questions appear to be looking so see if a mechanics bay rental business model, much like some hair salons, has merit.
Did I read that correctly?Thank you both.
I am not a mechanic.  The line of questions are not marketing, but practicality.  I work with several folks with entrepreneurial spirits and previous history with being angel investors.  We found it extremely rewarding and want to do more.
Vehicles, engines, mechanics and the hands-on trades are where I come from and where I grew up.
Car repairs, mechanics and the automotive supply chain are extremely critical to our society and infrastructure and we believe this entire sector can thrive in any economy.  Vehicles are necessary and are also critical points of failure in the work to live/live to work cycle.
I have posted this in several forums for mechanics as we try to see and learn from those with the real experience.
This certainly isn’t a get-rich-quick type of business plan, in fact, we can hardly get it in the black under 5 years, but the premise was a building with 6 or so bays and invest 6k-10k per bay and let it be a building block, or first step for a self-employed mechanic.  Have a reasonably set monthly rent and let the mechanic generate his/her own business and get started.  This model is highly successful for hair salons, nail salons and other appointment/service businesses.  A car repair shop just has a much higher investment into the bay, lift, environment, tools and such.
As we read through the forums and replies, it seems that many want to be independent but money and start up is the obstacle.
I truly appreciate you taking the time to reply and comment.
Thank youWould you be providing tools?
In hair salons, the workers rent their chairs and often have to provide at least some of their tools, but then there aren’t a whole lot of ruinously expensive tools in the hair styling world. Would each rental bay have to provide its own scan tools/alignment machines / tire balancers / other stuff that’s priced in the stratosphere?
If so, you might have trouble getting people to sign on. If not, you might have trouble paying the startup costs, and since those people aren’t your employees, you might also have higher than average problems of expensive assets walking out of the shop.

You really need to talk to someone who has a shop like you thinking of , preferably out of your area so they will not worry about you taking their business away.
Every rental shop space like you are talking about has gone out of business in my area because they just had too many months that they did not show a profit .Thanks Shadowfax…we have modeled this so many different ways that we don’t even know what the right answer would be on what the “shop” would provide as included in the lease, additional rental time or just not available.  We are certain that we would not nickel/dime. Nobody wins in that arena.
Let me float the outline here and you guys can pick it apart…
This is only a facility for a mechanic.  The mechanic runs his/her own business as they see fit and follow the rules of the shop regarding safety, and all that entails.
15’x25’ bay.  Yours, nobody else but yours.  Lock it up as you see fit.  Maybe we “cage” each bay?  Seems over the top?
Lift or no lift…your decision and monthly rate driven by this choice.  Three ideas here are just a bay, a bay with a lift, a bay with jack/stands and ramps.  Lift is 4 post, 120v, 18’ runways and moveable.
Shop/lease provides air compressors, power, exhaust evacuation system, oil recycling and AF recycling, trash, customer consult office and bathrooms.
Tool program…for the mechanic with no tools yet or not enough.  Thinking typical tool boxes with 300-400 piece quality set.  Not Pittsburgh, but not not Snap On.  Standard air tools set with 4 or 5 of the common ones.  Middle of the road code scanner and electrical tools  This is not a complete list and open to your thoughts here.  This is going to be about the only additional charge and goes into monthly rent/lease.
Community/shop tools.  These are available to all tenants without additional charge.
Welder, torches, pullers, spanners, 3/4” impact, parts washer, 20ton press, bench grinders, and other limited use items.
Specialty stuff like alignment rigs, tire shop equipment and huge specialized gear are likely out of scope for this…at least in the beginning.
That’s the short of it.
Appreciate all the conversation here. Thank you.Curious if these failed ones were strictly DIY and relied on hourly rentals of bays, or if it was this model of a lease like I am describing.
We do agree that if this was a successful concept it would already be out there and thriving…and it isn’t.
Really just learning what went wrong or why.Your initial post is the very definition of marketing, not practicality. I don’t have a problem with marketing but I do have a problem when posters are not honest with their motives.How well is the WeWork model succeeding?
It’s unlikely that someone afraid to dip more than their big toe into the cold water has much of a chance of succeeding in any effort at being an entrepreneur. Bluffing your way to the top makes for a good movie plot but in reality it’s likely a losing proposition for all involved.


 diz_j_171750:

Really just learning what went wrong or why.


You want real research on this , then you talk to people out of your area who have a business like this .  You go out of your area so they will not suspect you of trying to take their business away from them.
Frankly I don’t see this as a way to really help someone become an independent shop owner.Ok. Fair enough. I explained it more later.  Thank youApologies, but I am not following your reply.Thank you Volvo
Agree on your point to talk to existing or closed businesses. If this idea was getting a more positive reaction, that would be in the next steps.
Across the several forums, we are reading many more negatives than positives to the idea.
The infancy of the idea was to help proliferation of the trade and provide a first step for individuals.  The real world seems to view this much differently and although the concept feels practical and even advantageous to help people, it doesn’t read like this is a beneficial option.
Mustang man…I guess this could read like a marketing study, but that was not the intent.  The intent was to learn from real world mechanics what keeps them from growing into heir own small businesses.  I can see where the line is blurred.
Thanks for the continued conversations.I doubt if the lift you are describing or the tools you describe would stand up to Commercial work or be desirable to a mechanic. If I were starting out as a mechanic, I would rather work out of my home garage than rent your bay.  At least my customers would know where to fond me.  I do not believe Stanly tools are better quality than arbor Freight, just more expensive.  Craftsman tools used to be made of good quality steel when they were made here even though they were not as pleasing to the hand as Snapon or other high quality tools but tat all changed when they went to China.
I don’t think your business model will draw customers for the mechanics or help yjrm prompte their “brand” and a bad experience at one bay willtarnish the whole building in the consumers minds.If you’re serious about pursuing this possibility your first stop should be a casual chat with a local CPA who has several Auto Repair clients.
Don’t expect any names, details or anything that might be considered confidential but with years of financial experience they should be able to give you a general idea of what works, what doesn’t and why.
And as others have already commented, this is one of those “great ideas” (a variation of the barbershop, beauty shop, Hair Cuttery model) that has already been tried but never seems to work in practice.
Some of the problems are the greater investment, longer period of return and insurance risk and cost.
i.e. A barber can start working with little more than some clippers etc. ($500), cover their investment in a couple of weeks and do their work with minimal liability risk and the salon owner’s equipment and ongoing overhead costs are a small fraction of what a mechanic requires.One more major issue-insurance. With multiple new mechanics coming and going I wonder if you could get it. Call an agent and see.Thank you for taking the time to reply.  Great point that one bad/rude/ripoff mechanic can ruin the entire garage.  Consumer point of view is a valid concern.
Thank you",,,,

698,Tie Rods and steering wheel position,Maintenance/Repairs,9,11.7k,"I recently replaced the passenger side tie rod on my 2008 Dakota Sport. I counted the number of turns required to remove the old piece, measured it against the new to make sure they were the same size (they were) and turned the new part on the same number of turns. Everything works fine, no pulling or drifting noticed and so far no sign of abnormal tire wear. It does seem that the steering wheel is biased slightly to the left of horizontal though. Could this be caused by the tie rod end being off a turn or two? Is it more likely that it has always been that way and I just didn’t notice?
jimIf the wheel is off center after replacing a tie rod end the toe is likely not correct. incorrect toe will cause excessive tire wear on the inner or outer shoulders depending on the direction of the error.To get that aligned you lengthen one tie rod and shorten the other. If the truck steers to the left with the steering wheel straight, you have to bring the wheels to the right slightly with the turnbuckles. If they were made right, turning one will change the length of the tie rod. Yes, I had one that had right hand threads on both ends. Ford of course, 1965 car.
A half turn might do the trick. If you go the wrong way, just double it the other way. Usually I adjust my rear wheel drive vehicles after the alignment is done. If you do it without the alignment, your steering wheel will be straight but the toe-in could still be too much or too little.
Let the shop do it and you won’t hurt your tires or your fuel economy. You may also have more go power on ice and snow. The truck works better if the wheels are going in mainly the same direction.@Jim, any tricks on ensuring the tie rod unscrewed easily off?  I am doing this on a 1998 and worried about corrosion and not able to twist it off easily.  Youtube shows heat and penetrate oil…any other suggestions?IMHO it needs to be properly aligned on an alignment station. Not a big deal.
For the record, alignment should always be based on centering the steering wheel first. That centers the steering rack and centers the tie rod inner joints (inner sockets, those joints inside the bellows) relative to the steering knuckle, ensuring proper geometry as the angles interact.
No tricks, gdawgs. Heat, penetrating oil, and elbow grease.To remove the inner tie rod end run the rack out fully to the side being replaced and hold the rack with a crescent wrench on the flats of the gears to prevent it from twisting against the pinion while twisting the tie rod end with the proper tool.When you are talking about a slight bias on the steering wheel, you are talking about only a fraction of a turn on the tie rod.  What you did with the new tie rod end, I have done when removing and old tie rod end and putting it back on.  In that case it works.  But that doesn’t always work with a new tie rod end.
They may measure the same length etc. but where does the thread cut start.  If it started at the 12 o’clock position on the old tie rod end and the new one starts at the 9 o’clock, then the new tie rod could be off a quarter of a turn, and that is plenty to affect the alignment.I do hope the truck does not have rack and pinion steering. I hope it has a steering box type.My son has a 2002 Toyota forerunner generation three he had his brakes in front and back can you please everything if you got it back a week later the steering went out on the freeway to head to hold a stream on the left but I have a chance can you go straight to get back to the shop we had a great time and have them do an alignment everything is fine for about a week same thing happened steering wheel had to be turned left to have a time to make the vehicle go straight Took it back in to get the alignment again and the same thing happened a day later to the back to the same shop called him he said it was a rack and pinion went out to get me to cause a problem rack and pinionBrian , start your own thread instead of tagging on to a 7 year old one.

699,2014 Ford Fusion Hybrid Stability Control lights,Maintenance/Repairs,10,326,"Hello friends,
So my Ford Fusion hybrid has 110k miles on it.  My wife was driving it today when the stability control lights both came on.  I attempted to turn traction control on as it was showing off. The system won’t allow it to turn on.  I hooked up my trusty obd scanner but no codes are being thrown.  Nothing, nada.  The wife said no noise happened, nothing out of the ordinary.  I drove it after the fact and everything seemed fine, minus those 2 lights on the dash.
What, if any, ideas do you have? What should I examine and trouble shoot?
Thanks as always!Most common problem is one of the wheel speed sensors is bad. You need forscan to read the ABS codes. https://forscan.org/home.html 2Most code readers only read P codes from the engine control. This car has set a C code, or chassis error code. As @wolyrobb points out, you need a more comprehensive reader.
Forscan can do that and more. The PC version is free but requires a laptop and the proper $50 cable. The website shows you which one to buy. I use both the cell phone version and PC version.Thinking about it… if the ABS light is not on, I’d guess the yaw and acceleration sensor has a problem, not a wheelspeed sensor. A wheelspeed sensor would take out the ABS as well.There is also a phone app called OBDFusion that will probably read the code. It will require a separate OBD2 bluetooth dongle and you’d have to buy the app and a Ford-specific bundle of programming. The popular Torque app will not retrieve C-codes.Any pros/cons on doing the pc version vs the phone one? Noticed 50 dollar difference in units but I use MACs so will have to use a Windows emulator to run the PC version.
If the phone version covers everything I might just spend the extra 50 and pay the 100 for the unit.The PC version is more comprehensive but the phone app will read C codes.image828×1792 218 KB image828×1792 184 KB image828×1792 186 KB
I got these under ABS. Will have to do some research. But any early thoughts?Went with the phone version for now. Posted a few pics of the ABS reading above.  Not having much luck on the research frontThat B300A code is telling you their is a broken wire from the ignition switch… or the BCM computer has failed which might be more likelyEverything I’m finding on BCM is related to alarm and keyless entry.

701,2010 Chevy Equinox - After start it chugs and dies,Maintenance/Repairs,25,11.5k,"Hi everyone,
I have a 2010 Chevy Equinox LT AWD.
Since having the spark plugs replaced, we have been having the following issue:
Specifically on cold days, after staring the car and staying idle, the car RPMs will drop, the engine will shudder and the car will die.
We now sit with the car in idle and have our foot ever so lightly on the gas pedal to counter the drop in RPMs and the chugging that we notice. We do this for a few minutes before the chugging goes away and we can then drive away.
If the car sits for more than 2 hours after that, it does it again.
It definitely started happening more often now that the temperature has begun to drop. In the summer, this happened maybe twice.
No indicator lights come on, everything looks and acts as it should otherwise.
Any ideas? I have had it in to the Chevy Dealer in town with no resolution yet…
Thanks!Have someone clean the throttle body to see if that solves the problem.
TesterThank you! I will get them to take a look and will update the post with the results!I recently ran into a bad MAP sensor that caused the same symptoms. It’s entirely possible, since they sit over all that heat and get brittle, are made of cheap crappy plastic ect, etc, etc, they could have easily have cracked it while working on it when changing your plugs. I only noticed it was cracked when I attempted to remove it to clean the upper intake. Had I not attempted to remove it, I might not have ever noticed and it still would have been stalling.
WayneCold temperatures make the engine – at idle –  more sensitive to the air/fuel mixture and to the amount the throttle valve is open. Those would be the place to start.  The throttle body check (make sure they check the throttle position sensor too)  mentioned above would address the latter, and for the former a shop would start by checking the ecm memory for active or pending diagnostic codes, and a general visual check for vacuum leaks.   If there’s any routine maintenance that’s behind schedule, sometimes getting all that up to date will fix a problem like this too.George may be spot on but the MAP sensor, if cracked, will literally suck air in if you lift the top of it and separate the crack. If you’re looking for things you can check yourself and don’t have lots of tools and all that, google where the sensor is and locate it, and just gently move it around. if it’s cracked and snaps off, at least you know what your problem was. if it’s solid and moving it doesn’t change the rpm’s it wasn’t that. If it’s a bad throttle position sensor, it’ll likely throw a code pretty specific to the throttle position sensor, unless it’s just cracked and sucking air in. You may be looking at a vacuum leak and, after getting the motor cover off, will start it up and say, “hey, that’s sucking air right there…let’s find out what that part is…” If you don’t find it by “nosing” around under there, by all means take it in. These forums aren’t very good for telling people what to tell the mechanic to do, they’re good for telling people willing to get their hands greasy what to look for. A decent mechanic already knows what to look for and how to look for it. As a mechanic, my worst enemy is the internet. Customers that don’t know how to put air in their tire suddenly know “exactly how it’s done” and “exactly how much it’s supposed to cost” will literally get indignant with you if it wasn’t the same as what they googled. It’s not a bad thing to learn about stuff even if you’re not going to do it yourself but the situation I’m talking about will often result in you paying more. An unscrupulous mechanic will get really annoyed when you claim to know more than he does and will charge you more. I don’t play that, I’m just giving you fair warning about how the business works. Good luck on your problem.My 2010 Equinox is doing the same exact thing. I’m curious what the fix was?Still having the issue here. We are taking it back in today for service tomorrow. Having all of the spark plugs replaced. Will let you know if that does the trick.I replaced the MAP sensor, that wasn’t it. I’m looking into the MAF sensor next. I put a smoke machine on it and couldn’t see any vacuum leaks.We are finally getting our car back. Been in the shop a few days and they replaced the fuel injection. Setback $1,350…
Christmas budget shrink.
Let’s hope this works.Fuel injection? I wouldn’t have guessed that. I’m curious to hear if it works or not.Well. It didn’t work. It is now back in the shop. Wasn’t what I was expecting either…Remove and clean the idle air control valve (IAC). Had the same problem on a 1997 Acura CL a few months ago. 30 minutes job.Oh man. I will contact the shop and ask for this to be done. Thanks for this!I’m not sure an Equinox has an IAC, but I’m gonna go look. I’ve been reading and I’m gonna try replacing the cam actuator solenoids this weekend.
So far I’ve ruled out:
Plugs
Map sensor
MAF sensor
Dirty throttle body
I keep hearing full coverage insurance, 5 gallons of gas, and a match works wonders.


 r9tee:

they replaced the fuel injection


What exactly did the replace?  All the fuel injectors?Yup all of the fuel injectors replaced. I will have an update by Monday if they find something else.It seems pretty unlikely all injectors would fail at the same time, unless perhaps the fuel system was opened up and gunk got into the fuel lines post fuel filter just prior to this occurring.  Did the fuel filter get changed at the same time as the spark plugs?  If not,   I’m not surprised replacing the injectors  didn’t help.
Have you had these tests done yet?

Diagnostic codes from ecm memory
Compression test on all cylinders, wet vs dry
Intake manifold vacuum measurement
Fuel pressure test
Measure fuel trims
Verify good quality spark
Verify base timing &  timing advance is working correctly
Exhaust system backpressure test
I noticed the screws that hold my air box together over the air filter are stripped out. Is yours the same way?Okay, update for you guys.
I went to a buddy’s brothers shop instead of the dealer.
He listened to the issues I had and suggested that before I take it in anywhere, to clean the Mass Air Flow Sensor.
I paid $8 for the CRC Mass Air Flow Sensor cleaner, took 20 minutes in all from getting the sensor out and spraying it 15 times and letting it air dry for 10 minutes before popping it back in…
The car is running smoother than it has in a LONG time.
Will report any issues again if any come up.

The easy answer is that I could replace the light bulb however, what I noticed is that if it turns on, it stays on, it does not flicker. When I turn them on and the light doesn’t come on it will sometimes turn on from some kind of impact like if I am a little bit herky-jerky with the wheel or the stick shift.
I’m a bit concerned that this means it’s some kind of a fuze issue and that replacing the light bulb won’t solve the problem.A blown fuse wouldn’t cause an intermittent problem. It sounds like the bulb isn’t making a solid connection or possibly there’s a loose wire somewhere. Have a good mechanic look at it.The loose connection thing wouldn’t surprise me because the car’s kind of low and I’ve had some definite surprise bumps while driving that wouldn’t usually impact a car.I don’t know if being low has much to do with it, the car could just have a stiff suspension or it might need shocks/struts. Have it looked at by someone who A: Knows what he/she is doing and B: Actually has hands on the car. You might have a couple of different things wrong.You might just need a new light socket.  GM seems to melt them from time to time.  I have a new one on the shelf waiting to be put in.  One thing that can be tried is to spread and clean the prongs some to see if a better connection can be made.Replace the bulb, the filament is loose inside the bulb.Or?
Switch the bulbs.
And see if the problem moves with the bulb.
TesterYou may have to replace the light socket due to loose contact connection to the bulb contacts.I tried that, and it worked!
It’s coming on without a problem, now.

703,Lady uses plastic bags for “gas can”,General Discussion,81,2.8k,"lady puts gas in plastic Bag
There are good ideas and then there are bad ideas.  I think we all know where this one lands!I actually had to use a gallon milk jug once in a pinch and it worked.  I did know that the plastic in these jugs and gas cans is the same chemistry (#2 HDPE) so figured it would work in the short term.  It did but this isn’t something I would willingly repeat.  The gas cans are a lot thicker of course and they pour a lot better.You see a lot of that stupidity in Florida when a hurricane is approaching. Seems like no one wants to store empty gasoline containers from storm to storm - we don’t have a lot of storage space - and fuel jugs sell out faster than any other storm prep supplies.
There were videos of people using 5 gallon, open buckets, too.“You’re doing great honey.”Has to be safe … she double-bagged it  In my younger years, I stored gas in numerous unsafe containers.    When you have little, you do whatever you can.The gallon milk jug I used was a funny story.  I had a faulty fuel gauge and a bad load of gas.  I was getting horrible mileage due to the bad gas but figured I had a lot left because I was going off my normal mileage.  I ran out of gas about a mile from a gas station and walked back with an empty milk jug that used as a water storage container and filled it with gas.
I once had a gas can that had a hole in it and seem to recall having to do something similar as it was mixed gas for small engines and I couldn’t just put it in my cars.Why can’t you use mixed gas in a car I have done it many times with the tank at least half full or better with no problem’s?Geez. Everybody knows you’re supposed to use styrofoam cups.I wonder if it was something like last minute prep for a hurricane as you suggest.  That would make the most sense.  I wonder if there are any collapsible gas cans like the water bladders you can get for camping and hiking or if something like that just wouldn’t be strong enough.  One of my buddies bought a big one of those and a raccoon bit or clawed at it on the first night it was used and that was that.  He replaced it with a blue plastic water storage container for the next trip.  That thing looks basically like a gas can and is made of the same material with a similar pour spout.  No animals have destroyed it either. I am guessing a collapsible gas can for easy storage is probably out of the question.
I hear people also go crazy and buy out every generator available as well.  You would think people would all have those by now but I guess not.I didn’t know if I would foul something with the mixed gas or not.  I figured one time and only a couple gallons at most wouldn’t do anything but catalytic converters and oxygen sensors are not cheap.  I wouldn’t think twice about it in an older car with no emissions controls.I hear people also go crazy and buy out every generator available as well. You would think people would all have those by now but I guess not.

You would think so.                                                                                                                      But after the hurricane is over & the cleanup is done might be a good time to buy one from the people who  do not want to hang on to them.I saw someone use one of those big 44 ounce Styrofoam cups like you get sodas in at gas stations to hold gas from a mower being worked on once.  It held for a few minutes and then just suddenly dissolved!
I think most plastic bags are HDPE or LDPE so I would assume they are chemically compatible with gas.  I don’t know about any of the others besides polystyrene (#6 recycling symbol) being a no-go.  All gas cans that I see are HPDE (#2 recycling symbol) or metal so I would assume it is the most chemically compatible material when dealing with gas.What’s with the red pumps that say “K”? Is it kerosene? Or the store name? Like circle K? Did not watch videoWow…that was amazing. Lol. The thing is though I can’t imagine if all that gas spilled in my trunk…what a disasterThat would be an accident looking for a place to happen.


 Cavell:

What’s with the red pumps that say “K”?


Probably k for “Kroger”
It clearly says “Kroger” at one point in the video
That’s a chainIt is a Kroger store.  They are a huge chain and also own many stores that don’t go by the Kroger name.  They are a huge retailer much like Wal-Mart.  Some have gas stations and some do not.  Kroger is pretty far and few between in my region but there is one in my town.  I wish it had a gas station as you get rewards points for buying groceries and the only way to use them is on gas.
I found one with a gas station while traveling and got some crazy price off each gallon of gas purchased with all the accumulated points.
Either way, that first bag was leaking like mad.  I bet her car was a mess.  You would want to leave the trunk open for days and the windows rolled down for a while after that.It was a Kroger’s gas station.

704,Hair drying,The Show,14,2.4k,"Teresa can find hairdryers that plug into the accessory outlet in the car on Amazon or shopping.com 2, or whatever online shopping search. Lookup 12V Hair Dryer. She would probably be more comfortable with that than a window defroster, which would heat up the whole car.

 That said, isn’t there another section here about Distracted Driving?Yeah…and there are “bonnet” style hair dryers that she could wear and dry at the same time with minimal distraction (I think!)…much better than trying to use a hand held dryer while driving!Anybody looking for just an accessory fan can find one at the truck stops. There’s a good one in Yakima, WA. There are fans that plug into the 12 volt plug, and can be very powerful, with multi-speed control. One that I’m thinking of (“The Turbo”) has a strong spring- clip to clasp onto something in car’s interiorI would have to second the bonnet style hair dryers.  They look like a shower cap with a hose coming out of it that attaches to a little suitcase that heats and blows the air.   Since the car’s heater system can supply the hot air, you could just duct tape the hose to the vent.  (or make a removable adapter like on a shop vac hose)  You control where the hot air goes, and both hands stay on the wheel.why do they NEED a hair dryer that plugs into their vehicle? If you NEED something like this, you NEED to get up 10 minutes earlier than you do nowI can’t believe that you told Teresa to go out and buy something when the problem can be solved with common household products.  Just duct tape some dryer vent hose to the dash over a vent that isn’t blowing on the front of her head, then duct tape the other end to the headrest.  Problem solved!  Any solution that involves duct tape must be a good solution!The last time I saw a bonnet hair dryer was on Laverne and Shirley.  Many years ago!10 years ago my dad and I (both engineers) were having fun coming up with intentionally stupid and ridiculous inventions. His best was the Ram Air Hairdryer car accessory. It had a body that would fit in the window and be held in place by rolling the window up to it. It had a scoop outside the car, a heating element w/ a cord to the 12VDC outlet, and a semi rigid hose that could be positioned around your head and stay place.
I gotta go tell him he’s got to make it now. He’s retired at this point so he has the time to tinker. Should have a prototype in a week…You made me laugh. Over the years I’ve come up with countless stupid and rediculous inventions…then some years later seen them advertised on TV, with someone probably getting rich off of them.Tell Teresa to step into the 21st century and get a new hairstyle.  Who uses rollers?What else goes with pink slippers and a pink bathrobe?A droptop would work. She could dry her hair by just putting the top down.Wonder what they?re going to invent next?a gas pedal that gives a foot massage too? If you make it I will buy it LOL  I imagine a simple shower head, or diffuser if you like, that can be velcro’d to the ceiling to force air onto the top of my head.  Seriously though, I’ve been thinking about this for a long time!  LOL  I don’t need to style it - just have it blow on my head.  A 12V air pump won’t work because its not warm or diffused (so… thought of that as well) but if i could get the air into a cap…  Have him make it and sell it on ETSY.Jeff only made one post 10 years ago so I doubt if he will see your post .",,,,
705,UTV adding a bigger battery and brake in period,Maintenance/Repairs,13,495,"I have a 2020 Polaris Ranger Crew 570 4 person. Sorry if this site is only for cars but figured I would try. Well its at the end of its   Brake in period the owner manual only tells me to change the oil and filter should I change any  thing else? And also I would like to get rid of the small battery and add a bigger car battery  is it that simple to just swapping them out?


 Solved by Mustangman in post #4 


                The owners manual recommendatuons are covered, that should be enough. 
As for the battery, if it is 12 volts, and it will fit, there isn’t any reason you can’t change it. You likely will need to modify the hold down for the bigger battery. Don’t assume it will just stay in place because it is heavy……
              
Admittedly I don’t know much about UTVs.
Having said that… why do you want to change out to a bigger battery?
If you’re looking to add more electrical power, I’m pretty sure that battery size doesn’t matter. My understanding is the alternator providers more electrical power.
I’d also be reluctant to mess with the electrical system on a 2020 anything. But that’s just me.It seems like a Forum for Polaris would be the best place for info . Also you local dealer might have a list of things they recommend that they have found to be of benefit .
If you are worried about not having enough battery power to start then just carry a small rechargeable battery pack with you.The owners manual recommendatuons are covered, that should be enough.
As for the battery, if it is 12 volts, and it will fit, there isn’t any reason you can’t change it. You likely will need to modify the hold down for the bigger battery. Don’t assume it will just stay in place because it is heavy… it won’t. Most websites that sell batteries give the dimensions so measure twice, buy once.
You might have to change the cable ends as well. A motorcycle style battery won’t have the same terminals as a car.  Has all this convinced you to leave the battery alone yet?Personally I think I would just leave it alone but two things.  Is the battery a standard wet cell or is it the spill proof type battery.   The replacement needs to be the same.  The other thing is depending on the charging system, you could burn out the generator if more amps are required to keep the larger battery charged.I’d wait until I was out of warranty before messing with different battery sizes.  I’d do just what the owners manual says regarding service after break in.I found the owner’s manual online
While they didn’t provide a part number for the battery, it’s clear we’re talking about an AGM battery.  So if you go for a bigger battery, make sure it’s also an AGMCan find only 2 batteries listed for the ""2020 Polaris Ranger Crew 570 4 ""

the owner’s manual specifically stated to buy a charger which can handle AGM batteries, presumably in case the owner goes for the optional AGM battery
Seems to me op should just get the optional AGM battery.  Looks like you wouldn’t even have to modify any wiring or hold downsFor now. Plan on adding  more lights and a winch and plow maybe  a stereo when I get a cab enclosureIf you’re going to add more electrical loads you may need to upgrade the alternator too.Been awhile hopefully u read this which one would u recommend from amazon for my 2020 Polaris ranger crew 570-4 to suit my needs this winter I’m gonna put it through a lot winch , radio , some kind of heater maybe just a blower for the window powered through the cigarette lighter  I’ll be using the winch with a plow@Josh12  -  I am going to try this again .  It seems that since you started this Sept 8 / 2020 you have enough time to  have the dealer install what you need if you even need anything.  Why would you buy something from Amazon that might void your warranty .I have a 2012 Polaris 550 Touring EPS ATV. It has a smaller battery that came with it. I run added lights and a hydraulic Boss 6’ V plow. Your owner’s manual should indicate what the electrical system is capable of supporting in its OEM configuration. If not, why not go to the Polaris dealer you bought it from and ask them? A winch is more or less standard gear so the winch operated plow is no big deal. Lights? Depends on how many and what type. I run efficient LED lights. They roast corneas without much power. Again, add up what you plan to add and then check against the manf recommended loading…you may not have to do anything.",,,,

707,Brand new control arm squeaking,Maintenance/Repairs,7,304,"I have a 2018 Trax with 23k miles on it. I had to bring it to the dealership last week due to it leaking coolant (covered under warranty) and while I was there they notified me there was a recall on it for both lower control arms and they were fixing that too. I don’t trust dealerships so after I got it back I drove it for a while to make sure it was good. This morning, several days later, I noticed a squeaking sound coming from the drivers side front tire. It squeaks when I’m getting in and out of the car and usually when I’m just driving at a low speed. Does not get worse when turning, seems to drive fine, no shaking, rattling, or pulling. Just a very annoying squeaking. I don’t know much about cars, most of my googling is telling me it’s probably fine. Not sure if it’s worth the headache of taking it back to the dealership.


 Melissa-48:

Not sure if it’s worth the headache of taking it back to the dealership.


Take it back , that is why you have a warranty ( Included in the price of the vehicle ) .  That is the only way you can be sure there is not a serious problem .The way I see it, you have 3 options

take it to the dealer to be fixed for free
take it to an independent shop and pay to have it fixed…
Or
believe random internet opinions from people who’ve not seen, touched or listened to your car and ignore it hoping it will go away. It might, it might not, or it might get worse. There is no way to know.

If your dealer is a hassle, you could take it to any other dealer of your make of car and they will fix it for free, too.It happened to me when I tightened the nuts and bolts while the wheel was hanging down. I loosened them, set the car down on the ground and bounced it a few times, then tightened things up to spec. Problem solved.I had a brand new control arm squeak, I took it back to the shop that did the repair and they fixed it for free.
Take it back.When working on automobiles and plumbing it’s good to remember that because tight is good doesn’t mean that too tight is better.You might consider that the squeak is a sway bar bushing and lubing them can shut them up. Odds are it was squeaking before but after getting the car back you were likely listening more intently for problems and just happened to notice it.I would disagree. Getting in quiet car is good time to hear squeak

711,Engine bucks only between 1800 and 2000 rpm - very strange problem,Maintenance/Repairs,14,34.6k,"2006 Ford Escape XLT 3.0L DOHC - starts and idles fine. good power upto about 1800 rpm and then again above about 2100 rpm. Problem only exhibits under load (going up hill). Problem does not exhibit in low gears. No engine codes. Replaced TPS. Jumped out EGR to test it - still happened. I could be wrong, but I do not suspect fuel delivery or spark problems because the engine runs fine above 2100 rpm. So, basically I can start up a long hill and everything is fine until I get to about 40 mph (it’s an automatic, but I think it’s in third gear by now) then the car starts bucking (engine sputtering). But once I get through that, about 45 mph, it runs great - plenty of power, I can race it right upto 70 mph and beyond. What causes an engine to sputter only between 1800-2000 rpm and only under load? ANYBODY HAVE A GUESS?Yeah do a fuel pressure test but I would also have the crankshaft sensor checked.  On my Riv I would get a hesitation at speed under load.   Replaced a lot of stuff but turned out to be the crank sensor.Offhand, I might guess at an EGR system fault, intake vacuum leak, or intake tract air leak. Is there any history of the intake tract system being serviced or worked on before this problem surfaced?
A few years back my Lincoln suffered a problem that sounds similar to the one your vehicle has.
It would buck and jerk around 40 MPH only and would only do this during mild acceleration. Moderately hard acceleration or nailing it and there would be no problem at all throughout the entire RPM range.
I eventually determined this to be caused by a razor cut like split that had developed in a small, breather hose which had softened over the years and which took some digging to discover. During acceleration (and it varied) the hose would suck down and the split would open up. This in turn affected the MAF sensor as the split was located post-MAF and pre-throttle body. A piece of duct tape wrapped around it fixed it right up until the correct hose could be located.Go to a local parts store and purchase an aerosol can of MAF sensor cleaner and clean the MAF sensor. The MAF sensor is one of the primary inputs into the computer. And if it’s dirty, it can cause the problem you describe.
TesterI’ll bet my morning bagel that you have a fault code or two sittiing in your ECU waiting to be discovered. Many parts stores will read to for you for free.This forum is awesome! Thanks guys. I plotted the MAF reading while driving (OBD scanner) it looked reasonable (about 3 g/s at idle to about 18 at 4000 rpm) but who knows. Cleaning it couldn’t hurt and cheap enough. I’ll try that next.
I’ve been tending toward the Crankshaft Position sensor also, but not the fuel pressure because it has plenty of power once I get past 2100 rmp. The next thing I’ll try after the MAF is breakdown and inspection of the intake between the MAF and the throttle body. I’ve been reading that can throw off MAF readings as well.
I’ll post my results. (1) clean MAF, (2) look for air intake leaks between MAF and TB, then (3) CPS. If I still have the problem, I’ll (4) check fuel pressure.
Thanks again.
PS: mountainbike, I’ll send you my address where you can send the bagel.The bagel is in the mail.
I went looking to see if you had a variable valve timing system (apparently you do not) and found a link with some good info.
Are there any signs such as rattling or whirring that might suggest a worn timing chain or its tesnsioner?
2006+ford+escape+3,0L+variable+valve+timingThis is a real head-scratcher. I really appreciate the help.
Update: getting nowhere so far… Cleaned the MAF sensor, cleaned throttle body, inspected and re-seated all air intake housings and connection points. Still no good.
No rattling or whirring. No whistling or odd noises of any kind. Still no engine codes.
Am I being stubborn not to suspect fuel pressure? It runs great once I get past the problem. Highway speeds - no problem. It can’t be fuel, right?
Is there a way to test the crank sensor?  My understanding is if it’s bad the car won’t start. All tests I’ve seen are to see if it’s working at idle.  Pretty sure mine is working at idle.  What about my ECU – any chance I need a new (or reprogrammed) ECU? How would I test THAT?I’ve had several fail total and you are dead in the water.  However, prior to the one failing total, I would get the hickup under load at maybe 50-60 mph.  No other symptoms for maybe 20-30K till it left me high and dry.  Just my experience.  I tried a lot of stuff looking for the problem including the trans.  Don’t know about Ford but GM could also be a wobbly balancer throwing the sensor off.The problem could still be caused by the MAF sensor. Sometimes cleaning helps and sometimes it does not.
It’s also possible that an intake vacuum leak could cause this and sometimes those leaks can be very difficult to find.
At this point and if the truck were mine, I’d connect a vacuum gauge to an intake manifold vacuum source and see what’s going on with the vacuum. This can also have an affect on the MAF.
If you do this it should be noted that vacuum readings will vary based on a number of factors but generally speaking you should see a reading of 17 to 20 inches with a rock steady needle.
It would seem to me that any problem with fuel pressure, crank sensor, and so on would show symptoms at RPMs outside that narrow range.
It is also possible for something like this to be caused due to a spark issue with a plug, coil, etc.Weak spark and dirty MAF would be my first thoughts.
A compression test wouldn’t hurt.Found it!!!  Went to a remote area of interstate and ran it up to 90. She sputtered again, but this time – finally – threw a code. Misfire. Replaced the coil on plug and spark plug. All fixed.
Crazy that it only happened around 40-50 mph (no code) then again at 90 (misfire code).  But, there you go.
This forum is really great. Thanks guys for the help.Congratulations! And sincere thanks for the follow up post.

712,Disposal of one gallon of gas mixed with two cycle engine oil,General Discussion,13,23.6k,"Will it damage a 2002 Toyota Camry with almost a full tank of gas to empty one gallon of gas mixed with two cycle engine oil to dispose of the gallon of gas/oil mixture or will the gas/oil mixture be sufficiently diluted to avoid damage to the Toyota?Back in “the old days”, some of us used to add a few ounces of Top Oil to our gasoline periodically, in order to provide some additional lubrication to the upper cylinder area.   This was actually a very good thing for an engine.
Nowadays, with the advent of catalytic converters, it is possible to damage the converter if too much oil is being burned–either as a Top Oil, or a 2 cycle gas & oil mixture, or as a result of badly  worn piston rings.   However, an occasional instance of dumping that 2 cycle gas/oil mixture into a relatively full gas tank will not damage the CC, and may provide some nice extra lubrication for the upper cylinder area.
The only caveat would be if this gas/oil mixture is more than…let’s say…6 months old.  In that case, the gas could be “sour”, and you could wind up with deposits in the fuel system.
As long as this gas/oil mixture is not more than 6 months old, this gallon of 2 cycle gas/oil mix should do no damage  to the engine or CC, and may actually be good for your engine.You might try putting a cup or two in there at first and see what it does, rather than dump the whole thing in there. If nothing happens, put a little bit more in at your next fill up.No problem, not enough 2 cycle oil in there to hurt anything.Your gas:oil mixture is probably about 32:1.  If you add the mixed gallon of mower fuel to 10 gallons of gas in you car’s tank, the mix ratio is now one-third of one percent - just about nothing.  I wouldn’t worry about it as long as you put the gallon into a nearly full tank of gas.I agree. I’ve been doing it for years and unless the motors self destructed on the cars of subsequent owners, I’ve experienced no problems. With two stroke, you can add a little stabile and keep over the winter and use the next year if it’s a yearly thing. Personally, i feel stabil is unnecessary for winter storage, but do it as a safety precaution. Lastly, if you don’t trust what we say, just dispose of it legally.If it is gasoline for a weed wacker and 60 to 1 mix, you have even more reason to just pour it in. That is close to nothing for a mix. The other mix is just two times nothing and your car would probably run on a whole tank full of the stuff and not ever notice it.Find a friend with a Dodge or Chrysler minivan, pour it in the tank, and nobody will notice the smoke since the minivans do that all the time.Uncle Turbo, 5 Stars, best adviceThere’s not enough oil in that mix to cause any damage to your car, especially if you are diluting it further with a full tank of gas.  If you still have reservations about burning it in your car, take the stuff to a place with an oil-fired heater and pour it in their waste oil tank (with their permission, of course).  One of those can certainly burn that stuff, and the people who own them are usually happy to have the free heat.  Just don’t pour antifreeze in there.

A poor electrical connection at the back of the instrument cluster can cause this.
TesterWhatever became of the failure Jeff?  What did you have to do to fix it?  I am having the same issue with the same failures for the same reason (water intrusion).I am having the same exact issues, Can anyone tell me what fixed the problem? It started with carpet wet in passenger floorboard, a/c wasn’t cooling and took it in for repair. They fixed several things they said caused the a/c problem and shortly after getting it back, it started doing the same thing. I took it somewhere different and the guy disconnected the switch that controls the rear a/c. This did fix the front air conditioner, but a few days later all the engine lights started flashing and the alarm kept going off. There was 13 codes, I cleared them and it stopped the problem for about a week. The engine light came back on and the 13 codes are back. The Aspen still runs ok, but I’m afraid it’s going to stop running and cost more than it’s worth to fix it. It looks like everything is related to the buss. The week it ran without problems it was sunning and clear outside, it rained and now the problem is back.

Here’s the CarFax report:




[Album] cfax

As you can see this car has moved about several states, but pay attention to the fact that it seems to have a Salvage AND a REBUILT title–they’re not the same things.
Can someone offer some clarification about this?
Is this a rebuilt vehicle? Or Salvage???


 Queue:

Salvage AND a REBUILT title–they’re not the same things.


They are indeed, effectively the same thing. Different states use different terms.
Unless the price is stupid low. I mean cheap as dirt that you can pay cash for AND you are a skilled DIY car mechanic, avoid this car like it has Hepatitis, the Plague, Covid and Ebola together … because it is the automotive equivalentOK, I hate to sound like an idiot but does the report mean that the car is SALVAGE (but NOT REBUILT?)



 Queue:

OK, I hate to sound like an idiot but does the report mean that the car is SALVAGE (but NOT REBUILT?)


Does not matter . They mean the same thing .  You don’t want this thing ( what ever it is ) . You might not even get insurance on it .We don’t even know what kind of car the OP is talking about.  An old car with a Blue Book of less than $3k in excellent condition?  A recent model being sold for a “too good to be true” price?  Or even worse, a recent model being sold for not much less than it would cost with a regular title?
I would avoid buying anything with a salvage/rebuilt/restored title if it’s less than 10 years old, and/or if the “event” which made the title salvage/rebuilt/reconstructed occurred less than 2 years ago, or if the current owner has owned the vehicle for less than a year.  If the current owner is a car flipper, or if they have only owned the car for a short time, I’d run away.
If, however, we are talking about an old car with a low dollar value, even a very minor accident or vandalism can result in the title being branded salvage/rebuilt/reconstructed.  Also, if the “event” which made the title salvage/rebuilt/reconstructed occurred many years ago, and the current owner has owned the car for a long time, I wouldn’t let the branded title worry me.  Any problems which were going to happen would have been dealt with by now.
Edit to add:
I clicked on the image of the screenshot, and was able to read the full Carfax report.  The vehicle in question is a 2013 Honda Fit, which was damaged in an accident back in 2015 when it was just two years old to the point it was declared a total loss, and subsequently repaired by a dealer and issued a “restored” title.  It has been driven less than 13,000 miles in 7 years.  I would not touch this thing with a 10-foot pole connected to another 10-foot pole, even if it was free.It’s a 2013 Honda Fit, so it’s definitely less than 10 years (or 8 years old in NY.)
my understanding is that a “Rebuilt” title means that the car was repaired and declared legally drivable whereas Salvage means it has NOT been repaired…You can get a 2013 Fit for less than 6 grand, so unless this thing is at least 50% less than that, it’s not something you’d want to consider even if you were a full-fledged mechanic and could do all the potential work for the price of parts.
As to the difference between rebuilt and salvage, it depends on the state. You’d do better to ask that state’s DMV what the difference is, because any of us who aren’t from that state might be wrong if we tell you what applies where we live.
I would want my own mechanic to thoroughly go over it if I were still considering this car. I do not trust passed safety inspections done by a shop I don’t know, because I don’t know how thorough they are, and I also don’t know that the inspection was honest.

Salvage means it has NOT been repaired


Which does not matter in the slightest as we’ve been trying to tell you since post #2.
For your purposes, it is the exact same thing.Got it, thank you 


 Queue:

Take a better look at the report.
Obviously, the car has not been in the category of ALL of the situations that were noted, namely… salvage AND junk AND rebuilt AND fire AND flood AND hail AND lemon.
The report is warning you that this is a highly problematic vehicle, but it is not telling you specifically what type of problem from that list is applicable.   Shouldn’t the more serious possibilities be sufficient to steer you away from this vehicle?Thank you!


 Queue:

A vehicle with a salvage title can not be registered, the vehicle must be repaired and pass an inspection to change the status to rebuilt.
This vehicle was declared a total loss in July 2015.
A rebuilt title was issued 8/24/2015 in Massachusetts.
Note that when the vehicle was moved to Pennsylvania the title status reverted back to salvage, then 8 days later a rebuilt title was issued. Perhaps Pennsylvania has its own inspection standards.
The vehicle then went to New Jersey and New York, what state is the vehicle in now? Will it need to pass inspection again?Insurance company sold the car at auction as “Salvage/Scrap” = not worth fixing
Somebody bought it at auction and “Rebuilt/Repaired” the car, had it inspected and the state issued a “Rebuilt” title


 Nevada_545:

The vehicle then went to New Jersey and New York, what state is the vehicle in now? Will it need to pass inspection again?


If it’s in NJ, the only inspection that it would have to pass is the emissions check.
As one of the inspectors said to me, after Chris Christie eliminated safety inspections…
Even if you limp in here on 4 flat tires, with no glass and no working lights, I still have to give you a passing sticker if your emissions are okay.
Thanks, Christie!
I was referring to a rebuilt vehicle inspection should the title status revert back to “salvage” in a different state, not annual safety inspections.Everybody wants to find a “great deal” but if that “puppy” is drooling, snarling  and looking like a racoon it’s probably not a good choice.Maybe an extreme case but what can happen if a shop takes a shortcut on a Honda Fit (glued the new roof on instead of welding)



The Drive 11



Couple Awarded $42 Million for Crash Injuries After Body Shop Glues on... 11
The body shop claims the insurance company bullied them into performing a cheaper repair.





In OK a vehicle that has been declared a total loss can be repaired and put back on the road. The title will be designated a “Salvage” title and means the same as “Rebuilt”.
I wiped out a Subaru I once owned when some woman on the shoulder with her emergency flashers on suddenly decided to make a left turn from the shoulder and across both northbound lanes so she could go back in a southerly direction. This took out the entire front clip along with the radiator, condenser, most of the suspension, and front subframe.
I repaired the car myself, the state issued a “Salvage” title on it, and I drove that car for another dozen years and 180k miles with no issues before scrapping it at 300k miles.
Oddest thing of all was that during the entire time I drove it on a salvage title Carfax continued to show it as having a clean title.The problem with a vehicle that has been rebuilt after being declared junk  - is how well the repair was done. This actually is done a lot…but it depends on the severity of the damage - which you really have no way of knowing. If you knew the extent of the damage then MAYBE. I’ve seen cars declared a total loss because the 2 front air-bags deployed.
The other red flag is it’s a Honda Fit.  Good reliable vehicle, but is is it really worth bringing back from salvage? And again what was done.
The last red flag is the multiple states this thing has passed through.
As others have said…unless you can get this dirt cheap and have it inspected BEFORE you buy then maybe. I won’t pay more then $2,000.One last thing…On Jay Leno’s garage - I think the guest was Joe Rogan. He bought a fully restored 1966 Vette. Looked beautiful. After he bought it he took it to his mechanic. And his mechanic found a MAJOR PROBLEM. Seems this brace behind the dash was cut off. You couldn’t see it because it was hidden behind the dash…but his mechanic was familiar with it enough to know to look for it. Do you know what to look for on a car that’s been restored?

719,Automatic Battery Charger,General Discussion,30,4.5k,"I need to know if it is safe to use an “Automatic battery float charger”
I usually go away 30 to 60 days at a time, and inevitably when I came back the battery in my car is exhausted. Last year, to the advice of my mechanic I disconnected the  negative cable from the battery. When I returned from my trip to Italy, I reconnected the cable, and the engine started with no problem, but the next day…dead!  The technichian from AAA recommended an eletric (to be plugged in)  automatic battery float charger. (Car is always garaged)
I’m getting ready to go away again, but I’m afraid to use the charger. Is this device safe or it can cause an eletrical fire?  Please advice!!!We usually recommend a “battery minder”, which is a slow charger that automatically keeps the battery topped up. They are not expensive and quite safe.
Sorry, never heard the term “float charger”.I know this one isn’t super cheap, but I’ve had it for several years.  I use it professionally at work and have been very happy with it.
The nice thing about it is that it will also charge a completely dead battery, should you ever leave the dome light on.  I’ve successfully charged stone dead group 31 batteries back to full functionality with this tool.
Anyone that knows what a group 31 is, knows that aint some small lawnmower battery.
http://www.napaonline.com/Catalog/CatalogItemDetail.aspx?R=NBC85640_0397963641 33Docnick…a “float charger” keeps a battery charged at the rate that it discharges. It will not overcharge a battery like a trickle charger. I haven’t heard the term either for about 30 years. I didn’t even realize that they were still sold or utilized anymore.I have charged a dead group 27 battery overnight with a 2A trickle charger so charging a group 31 with a 125 amp charger isn’t a big deal, but that NAPA charger is a good one if you need a professional grade charger or use one a lot.@Keith yeah I use it a lot.  Several times a week.  Our fleet has thousands of vehicles and several shops.  “My” shop is responsible for hundreds of vehicles.  There’s always some guy that forgot to turn off his lights.I have a battery maintainer from sears for my boat, $46 5 years ago that works great for me, Though I can ask but a bud of mine had a charger for his boat, battery caught on fire, then gas tank caught on fire, lucky we have a good fire department, toasted boat and garage.The other option is the obvious one. Disconnect fully charged battery  before storage but,  Charge it just before you start the car when you return. Personally, I do that with all my boat batteries rather then leave something plugged in for 30 to. 60 days. Assume you have  had the battery and car charging system checked too ? My batteries seldom loose much charge disconnected for 30 plus days if they are fully charged to begin with.@dogosa try 9 months, September till June, MN weather.Me, I wouldn’t leave a charger on a battery for that long unattended.  Certainly not if the battery were inside, where if it caught on fire it would damage something.
Removing the battery before you leave, thoroughly cleaning its top of all acidic residue, neutralizing with some soda water,  then storing it (off the car) in a warm dry place will help.  You can charge it up with a regular battery charger when ou get back, before re-installing it in the car.  That’s what I’d do.  I concur w/@dagosa.
It’s sort of puzzling that you came home, the car started fine, presumably you drove it, then the next day it wouldn’t start.  That might be the indication of a different problem.  Have you taken the car for a battery and charging test at one of those places that do this for free?  Might be worthwhile.“When I returned from my trip to Italy, I reconnected the cable, and the engine started with no problem, but the next day…dead!”
If this battery has been drained empty more than a couple of times and it’s more than a few years old it’s near the end of it’s life.
With a healthy battery disconnecting the cable will work for 6 months or more.
I don’t advise leaving the battery float charging (it is an engineering term) unattended, that’s a bad practice with any kind of battery.My charger switches to “maintain” mode when the battery reaches full charge.
My charger stops charging if it senses that the battery is defective and/or won’t take a charge.
I’ve charged batteries unattended overnight countless times.
I have never fried a battery.
I have never burned down the shop.
I have also never left a charger hooked up for months at a time.“I have also never left a charger hooked up for months at a time.”
That’s what I really meant by unattended.George, these chargers are designed specifically for this type of service. No harm will be done.
The “Battery Tender” brand is well-regarded. I got mine from amazon.I have both a Schumacher 1.5 amp battery maintainer/charger; cost about 25 bucks and a Harbor Freight float charger that cost about 10 bucks.  You do not want to use a ordinary battery charger for long periods of time as it will deteriorate the battery but a maintainer or a float charger will be ok.  The Schumacher is a 1.5 amp charger for as long as it needs to be and then automatically goes into maintainer mode.  Both work for me; do the job equally well and both are UL Listed.  I use them all winter long to keep a couple of motorcycle batteries ready to go in the Spring.  They work equally well with car batteries.
UL Listing means that the device has been tested to determine that if it should fail, it will fail safely in a manner that is not harmful to people and property.Okay.So you are saying leaving a battery  on a tender is a bad idea? I do not buy it. Why would the lawyers let sears sell a battery tender - maintainer if it did not work? Not to mention the numerous posts on this site suggesting one.@Barkydog who is your question directed at?@db4690 any one such as suggested by @circuirtsnith""I have also never left a charger hooked up for months at a time.""@Barkydog I haven’t had reason to leave any kind of charger/maintainer hooked up for months at a time.
I personally never said anything even remotely negative about those battery charger/maintainers.
But others may be hesitant to leave a charger/maintainer hooked up for months at a time.
Everyone has the right to use the tool as they say fit.",,,,
720,"Windshield Wipers Froze, No Longer Work",Maintenance/Repairs,11,16.2k,"Last time I drove, it was pouring out, so my wipers were on. I cleverly forgot to turn them off when I parked, and we got dumped with snow that night. In the AM, I started the car to get the defroster going while I scraped the ice & snow. The second I started the car, the wiper motor did its thing, but the wipers were frozen in place under huge chunks of ice, so they couldn’t move. I’m guessing the spindle on the wiper motor was ruined, but I’m hoping not - that there’s some simple solution for making them work again that won’t require waiting until it stops snowing 3 days from now so I can drive to the shop and get a new wiper motor installed.

 I drive a 2003 Honda Civic Hybrid. Anyone know if there’s any way out of this without a couple hundred dollars in repairs 10 days before Christmas?Are you certain you didn’t just blow the fuse? Usually that happens long before the motor manages to destroy anything.More than likely a ball and socket joint in the linkage popped out or where the motor connects to the linage popped out.  Also where the wiper arms connect to their pivot points can come loose so check those.  You may have to remove the cowling under the windshield to find the problem but that isn’t a difficult task really.  Of course it is possible that you actually did some damage, but more often than not something just broke loose.Try removing the wiper arms and inspect the splines of the arms where they mount to the posts. The arms are made from aluminum. And when wipers freeze to the windshield and are then turned on, the splines in the arms usually get stripped out so the wipers don’t function. If the splines are stripped out of the wiper arms it’s just a matter of replacing the wiper arms.
TesterThat was my first guess, but you can hear the motor whirring when you switch the wipers on, and its speed changes depending on the switch setting, as expected.Thanks, I’ll try this!I haven’t tried, yet - mostly because we have no garage and it’s single-digits outside, and snowing.

We don’t actually know which engine and transmission this van has.  It was offered with the 3.0L V-6 together with the “Torqueflite” 3-speed automatic, as well as with the 3.0L/3.3L/3.8L engines together with the 4-speed automatic.  Only the 4-speed transmission is computer-controlled.  The 3-speed actually gives the perception of 3 shifts–the third shift is the lock-up torque converter activating.Since the transmission won’t shift up from second gear there is a 99% chance that this is the 42TE transmission.This Van has a 3.8 but I do not know the Type of tranny.The 3.3 and 3.8L engines were only offered with the 4-speed computer-controlled automatic.  This transmission uses a solenoid pack, input and output speed sensors, and a TCM.  The TCM has a “limp mode” in case a sensor or solenoid problem is detected.Have you checked the transmission fluid level and condition? Have the fluid and filter been changed as per the maintenance schedule (more frequently would be better)?
Simply having the wrong fluid in the transmission can cause limp-home mode. Unfortunately, running it too long this way will wear out the clutches.",,,,

Get it checked out.How long after the accident?  The SRS error might be related to the accident. If the times are close, you might ask your insurer what to do. A few years back, my daughter was in an accident. The shop that did the repairs didn’t replace the right front wheel bearing. When I heard it, we called our insurer immediately.

723,Wheels,General Discussion,11,1.0k,"What are the issues with putting larger than normal size factory wheels on a car? Is it safety, performance, car handling, etc?  Are there any advantages to this modification?If the larger wheels are also wider, you may be overloading the outboard bearings, and they will fail prematurely.
Your speedometer will be off, reading lower, which may get you a ticket.
The steamroller tires you see on those kids cars rersult in DISMAL HANDING. They normally only provide increased traction in a straight line for acceleration.I assume you’re talking about those rims that are like 9 inches tall and like 20 inches wide.
Upsizing, you’ll get a tad bit better handling which will result in a harsher ride and be more prone to damage from potholes, curbs, etc.Advantage: They look way cool.
Disadvantage: Everything else.Use the +1 and +2 options at tirerack.com to see which wheels will work correctly with your 325i.Larger than factory wheels that still wear tires with the same outside diameter and tread width, will show increased handling capability, may run cooler tires at higher speeds and may provide better brake cooling. All this depends upon the make of car and lots of luck to attain. Otherwise, they are more prone to damage, ride harder, can decreased load capacity and cost more to replace. That they look cooler is subjective. When I see the choice made for that extra alloy over factory recommended, they can look out of proportion  to me.
Perfect example is a truck based SUV with 20+ inch rims that practically negates all advantages they may have over a car.Advantage: They look way cool.
Disadvantage:  The look really silly. The only advantage is style, which is entirely subjective.  I have never seen aftermarket wheels which look better than the factory offerings we have today, or even in the past 15-20 years.  To me, they just look like a ridiculous fashion statement and ego trip that screams, “look at me! I spent WAY too much money on rims for my car!”  This especially applies to people who spent $400 on a rusted out Caprice or Delta 88, then spend $4000 on new springs and 24"" rims and tires with no sidewall.  Yes, I have actually done such projects in the past.  I don’t agree with doing the same thing on a $30,000 beemer, either.
Disadvantages are numerous.  You will experience unusual handling, increased road noise, a MUCH harsher ride, an inaccurate speedometer and odometer, rapid wear of suspension and brake parts, dramatically increased cost of tire replacement, as well as having to do it much more frequently, and, if you actually drive the car and are any less than a perfect driver, you will most likely have to occasionally replace individual rims.  If you even so much as look at a curb or a pothole with those things on your car, they will get scuffed, scratched, dented, or otherwise damaged.
If you want to make your mechanic rich while giving him a bad back, these may be for you, though.  I had a customer once with a Lincoln Navigator who had, if I remember correctly, 26"" wheels.  He spent several thousand on wheels and tires in the two years I was working on that truck, much of which was on the tires.  He said the most he could get out of a set of tires in that size was 10,000 miles, and those were so hard he couldn’t get traction in the rain.  He was in the shop at least every month having brake and suspension parts replaced, including pads and rotors, tie rod ends, ball joints, sway bar links, bushings, etc.  This was bad for us, too, because those wheels and tires probably weighed 130-140 pounds each!  This may be why he couldn’t keep that truck in brakes.  He finally put the (much better looking) factory 17"" wheels back on the truck and, guess what, stopped having problems with it.What size do you have now?  What year?  The only new wheels I would put on a 325i would be larger factory wheels, preferably ones that were an option for yours.  Others just don’t look right.  You can get ‘new’ (lightly used) factory rims as ‘take offs’ from a tire/wheel store or BMW dealer, or ebay/craigslist.I really need to take a picture of this truck near my house. It’s an F-150 with large enough rims that the tires are barely there(think 17s on an older Civic sized tire).

Do you guys have any recommendations?I think Katzkin is about your only option other than replacing the entire seats with leather ones from a similar year vehicle out of the wrecking yard. Katzkin’s are designed to work with the factory seat airbags if it has them… and that is VERY important!",,,,
726,2006 Chrysler 300 - flashing oil light,Maintenance/Repairs,11,593,"I’m driving 2006 Chrysler 300 and engine oil light comes on and keeps flashing. Minutes later it goes off and comes back on. Moments later, vehicle shuts off and refuses to start. After 15-20 mins, engine starts and drives for another 10-15 minutes and shuts off again. Don’t know what going on and need some help. Changed the oil pressures switch but problem still occursThen you need to hook up a pressure gauge and find out if the oil pressure is within specifications.The car is trying to prevent you from destroying its engine. You are trying hard to work around that safegaurd. Keep it up and you will seize the engine from lack of oil.
Tow it to a shop that can diagnose the actual problem. Don’t be surprised if they recommend a new engine.Have you at least checked the engine oil level . . . ?!
That is the first step
If the level isn’t within the cross-hatched marks, top it off as neededI assume you checked the oil level.  My next step would be to change the oil filter.  It could be defective and blocking oil from getting to the engine.  I had that happen to me once.


 keith:

I assume you checked the oil level.


You’re a swell guy, Keith 
We’ve seen plenty of people come to this website asking for help, and they haven’t even done the basics, such as checking fluid level, reading the owner manual, and so forth
I’m more of a cynic . . . but based on plenty of experience
Probably every week one of our fleet’s vehicle operators comes in complaining that the red low engine oil pressure warning is lit.  When we ask them if they’ve checked the engine oil level, we get that “deer in the head lights look”
And these vehicle operators are supposed to check the fluid levels, lights, tires, etc. every single time they check out and operate the vehicle(s).  These vehicles even have an employer-supplied folder, which plain as day states what the operator is supposed to check every day
You can lead a horse to water . . .The reason I assumed that was this statement



 Stephen59:

Changed the oil pressures switch but problem still occurs


If he had the knowledge to change the pressure sending unit, he should know to check the oil level first.  If he had a mechanic do this for him, the mechanic should have done this first.
BUT, I could be wrong, you know the three words that make up assume.
Edit: I am a swell guy, thanks for noticing.  BTW, humble too


 keith:

If he had the knowledge to change the pressure sending unit, he should know to check the oil level first.


You have a point, but I’ll counter it nevertheless
There are plenty of people out there who replace parts solely because they read it on the internet, without understanding why
I could imagine a scenario where a guy jumps ahead and skips step one . . . . which would be checking the engine oil level
I know plenty of guys who’ve replaced sensors, switches, etc. . . . without first checking the fuse or looking to see if there’s a physically broken wire, for example
and the amount of work to replace some of these sensors and switches was considerable . . .Describe your problem. Well, I have a Chrysler. There you go.My thermometer says I have a temperature of 103 degrees instead of 98.6, so I replaced my thermometer.That is reminiscent of the guy who touched-up his chest x-rays because they indicated pneumonia.

727,Headlight fine scratches,Maintenance/Repairs,10,297,"I noticed my headlights are pretty scratched. The car is new, only 6000 miles. I just bought it 9 months ago. It’s hard to notice when the lights are off but when they are on. You can see thousands of hairlines of scratches. Judging by their pattern, it’s very likely caused by some carwash guy who cleaned the headlight with a dirty towel.
I have seen video about people repairing chipped windshield by putting some clear liquid onto it. Is this repairable? Thanks
headlight pic 28Just buy either new headlight lenses or new headlights. While you could polish out the scratches, it’s time consuming and laborious.Actually it looks like a lot of it is sandblasting from winter driving or driving on gravel behind someone.  Do you use the touchless car wash or the brush (obviously you don’t wash it yourself)?  I never use the brush to avoid those kinds of scratches on the paint.  You could try one of the products meant to clear up cloudy headlights but it will be some work and expense.  Don’t know what else to say except try a different car wash.For a near-new car I’d pay a shop to polish them.


 old_mopar_guy:

Just buy either new headlight lenses or new headlights.


That is an easy solution, replacement headlamps are $1500 each.I have seen what a local Nissan dealership can do to for foggy and scratched headlight lenses for less than 60.00 . They looked like new.Here’s how I look at this.
When the headlights are off,  it’s hard to notice.
When they’re on, it’s noticed.
When the headlights are on, it means you’re driving either at night or during precipitation.
Which means other drivers can’t see the scratches, nor can you.
TesterLooks like an amateur try to sand them out. The long scratches are typical of using dry sandpaper instead of  wet on dry. You could try using a plastic polishing compound like Meguiar’s PlastX or get them professionally polished.I agree with @Tester - I 'd just let them go.  They’re noticeable when on, bet they aren’t when off, so I bet they make zero difference in how well the headlights work.I’m with @bing. It looks like road rash to me. If you polish the lenses now, you’ll probably do it again in six months. Let it go until the light scatter is severe and decreases your road visibility.I’ve never seen road rash have those parallel curving lines like that. I’m with @COROLLAGUY1. That’s definitely someone either dry-sanding the lights, or doing something foolish like cleaning salt off of them with a dry paper towel. Or maybe they fell for that “magic eraser” stuff, which the company would have you believe has some sort of miracle chemical that cleans anything, but which is really just sandpaper on a sponge.",,,,
728,High pitched squeal followed by clicking,General Discussion,2,128,"Hi, I have a 2018 Hyundai Kona.

It’s coming from somewhere in the engine section of the vehicle, and it lasts maybe 10-30 seconds before turning off on its own.
Any ideas what this might be?Your vehicule is under warranty…go to the dealer.Does it happen every time you shut the car down?  If not, be prepared for the dealer to say they can’t duplicate the problem. You can try to narrow it down.  The next time you go for a drive, stop the car, open the hood, and listen to see where the squeal and clicking come from.

In  July, he hit a deer on the highway. he has a body shop that was going to do the work but the owner died in a boating accident. My son had paid for the parts to fix the car so now he has the parts but no shop near him will do the body work with those parts unless he signs a contract for $4000 up front… Is  this reasonable?


 Pat36:

Is this reasonable?


First of all furnishing your own parts is never a good idea plus the shop will not warranty anything .
See if the parts can be returned and just let the shop he chooses do the work.
As for the price , who knows without actually seeing the vehicle .Body shops typically charge $42-44/hr. for labor so that works out to 90-95 hours’ labor. I’m sure there are other charges factored in and I haven’t seen the damage but that seems fairly high. I could easily be wrong though. https://www.bodyshopbusiness.com/what-is-the-average-cost-per-hour-to-perform-body-work/ 3


 davepsinbox_157004:

It certainly does not apply in my area.


 VOLVO-V70:

Even if the rate is double, we’re still talking about 45+ hours’ labor and it still seems unlikely.


 Pat36:

When a vehicle with a repaired value of $3,000 needs $4,000 in repairs a signed contract and a deposit should be expected.
A signed contract is necessary to conduct a lien sale should your son abandon the vehicle.Would it be possible, even though the owner died, for the original body shop to return the parts and issue a refund?  This then becomes a legal question if no one at the original  shop has the authority to do that.
I have never had to prepay for parts at a body shop.  My shop even returned an OEM body panel to the manufacturer when it was received in less than pristine condition.
Another time I specified a different trim level bumper cover  that was slightly more expensive,  I stated I would cover the difference, again, no prepayment required for the part.
So, check the contract from the first body shop.The way I read the original post is that the son has the parts just needs a shop to install them .


 Purebred:

Would it be possible, even though the owner died, for the original body shop to return the parts and issue a refund?


If this shop owner had employees they may have been able to return new parts and applied a credit to the shops account, that would reduce the shops debit but it doesn’t help the person with the damaged vehicle.
If these were used parts, they may not be returnable.
This is still an old vehicle of little value that needs a $4000 collision repair.There is a 2002 Chevy Blazer worth $4,000?Does
anyone know a body shop in the Foxlake ,Illinois area that would put the parts together for him?? Any class for body work instructions??A picture of the damage and a list of the parts you have would be helpful in understanding feasibilty of the repair. I’ve had three Trailblazers and disassembled the front on every one of them.You or your son will have call shops to find one that will do that . Also the chance that someone from Foxlake will see this post is almost zero. As for a class , body shop work is not really that simple and just where would you get the tools and space to do that.Is there a technical school nearby?
These schools have body repair courses where they take your vehicle and repair it for free. But you pay for parts and supplies.
The problem with this is, your vehicle is added to a queue, so turn-around time can be lengthy.
TesterOr stop into a couple of the auto parts suppliers like NAPA etc. that sell paint and supplies and ask about someone working out of their home.  Usually these are folks that retired or moonlight.  It’s not hard to get $3-4000 in repairs from a deer though.  If there are frame repairs though, all bets are off.
I find it hard to believe though that a body shop would not have a business continuation provision in the event of the owner’s death.  They wouldn’t just leave cars half done in the shop without being completed and paid for.  Someone must be executing the shop closing.


 GorehamJ:

The title clearly mentions a 2002 Blazer
But in the first paragraph, op mentions a 2002 TrailBlazer

I’d value a Trailblazer over an S-10 Blazer any day of the week
I don’t know about $4000, though . . .


 GorehamJ:

There is a 2002 Chevy Blazer worth $4,000?


A quick Autotrader.com search for similar TrailBlazers within 300 miles of St. Louis yields prices from $2150 to around $6800. Based on that $4000 seems reasonable. However, if the OP has already paid for the parts, the $4000 is for labor and/or in the event of a lien sale. If the shop actually expects the OP to pay $4000 I’d cut my losses and find something else.Just off the cuff, I’d go ask the guy at “End of the Line Auto Repair” for a referral.  For some reason seems like he would know someone.  Don’t go to U-Haul though because the guy doesn’t wear a mask and comes within three feet of you when talking.  Some would call that attempted murder. (According to Linda anyway)  


 Bing:

In a paycheck-to-paycheck industry employees will load their tools and leave in less than 4 hours after the bad news.
When the business is drawing to a close the parts suppliers will stop credit and go to COD only for parts making it difficult to continue business.


 Tester:

Yes!
In my neck of the woods, some of the various counties’ vocational schools have an auto body repair program, and they will do the work gratis, as long as you supply the parts and the paint.   Hopefully the OP can find something similar in his area.

Somebody has got way too much time, or too many pumpkins.
I decided to skip Halloween this year since I don’t think any kids will be allowed to come by anyway.  I was going to buy one of those skeleton dogs from Menards, light him up with a solar bulb, and put a chain around his neck tied to the mail box.  Then I’d put a “beware of dog” sign right by the bags of candy, balloons, and stuff.  My wife talked me out of it.  Partly because I might get sued, and partly unable to shake my MRP issue (material requirement planning).  Ya gotta know how many goblins would come by to determine how many bags to pack.  Some friends do 500 then shut the lights off.  So I just decided to forget the whole idea.  Still I think it would be funny.Just got done re carpeting the porch, have a 12’ tube from the carpeting, could use it to send candy but thinking for the first year forever may skip the candy thing. Light on means stop by for treat. I will probably change my mind. OOH OOH, good excuse to buy an rc car to deliver treats. Edit, thinking I could step it up a notch, buy a drone to drop candy!For last year’s Halloween–which was clearly pre-pandemic–I bought 3 giant bags of candy, and I wound-up donating 2 un-opened bags to the local Children’s Hospital the next day, because my doorbell only rang once on Halloween night.   I managed to finish the opened bag of candy w/in a few months, but that probably wasn’t in my best interests.  
More than likely, the hospital won’t even accept candy donations this year, so… this year, I won’t even be buying any candy to distribute.My girl friend would set out a bowl of candy with a sign to take one piece, it was generally obeyed.  I suggested this year to put out small bottles of hand sanitizer instead of candy.",,,,
731,How to track previous owners of the car without VIN number,Buying/Selling,37,800,"Hi there! I’am Alex (Moscow, Russia), a friend of mine just bought a car of a dream - Ford Torino (1971) and he’s looking for previous owners to know all the history of his beast. The problem is - there is no VIN, but I’ve figure out - there wasn’t VIN’s those days. So the quistion is - how can I track previous owners, using engine or body number? I don’t know how it works in US, maybe there is some services/websites/companys which can provide that info? (licence car plate number identify won’t work because now the car has Russian VRP. The car was shipped in USSR in 89)
Thanks for the help and have a great day!Best way I can think of is to join all the old Ford and Torino forums I could find, post all identifying information there, see if anyone knows about it.  But the fact that it’s been out of the US for at least 31 years will make this very difficult to trace.Thanks for the answer!
I’ll try to join the forums!VINs have been around since mid 50s and became law they were in visible location in 1969. Both my 69 vette and 71 chevelle have VIN in corner of windshield as they are today. Your friend’s car likely had it removed at some point. If it hasn’t been majorly rebuilt, you may be able to find the original build sheet. Not sure what ford did but GM often had them on top of gas tank or under rear seat.Alex,  I can’t think of any reason to even want to know the history of a vehicle this old . The chance of even getting some info is slim.I know how it sounds, but I’m not an officer of KGB (just private investigator), my friend was dreamed about this car the whole life, muscle cars in Russia is not a mainstream (here is just KIA’s, BMW’s and Nissan’s  ) he is very proud of his Torino and want to know the history to tell the story of the car Снимок экрана 2020-10-22 190113553×622 323 KBThere is only 1A35H129342 type of number (I can decrypt it (Lorain, Ohio), but still can’t get VIN do track other info)Sorry, the text with photo was for you@VOLVO-V70- quit being a party pooper.  you don’t need to know why they want to know this info.  I’d be curious too.
geeze…
That’s funny, but I can understand it You won’t get a lot of info just from the VIN from back then. Here’s a site that describes the VIN- https://www.ford-torino.de/en/facts-figures/vin-decoder/model-year-1971/ 5
Finding owner history will tax your investigative skills but has been done before. Good luck. Sweet car!!Of course they had vin’s in 1971. My 1962 Cadillac has one.Thank you, I’ve decrypt info of Assembly etc. using this website before, but the problem is that the websites need 17-digit VIN to tracking the other info. I thought that it should be easy way to track using old-type VIN, but now I don’t think soYou should see the movie "" gran torino"" with Clint Eastwood.We both seen this movie  (Eastwood is the best, “Flags of Our Fathers”  and “Letters from Iwo Jima” is the masterpiece)Car in Russia? You may find that the previous owner is looking for it as it might be stolen. Don’t look to hard.Yep, in Moscow. Nah, we have all the documents of previous Soviet and Russian owners, the car was shipped in USSR legally, but we know nothing of US owners. I’ll try to contact the son of the Soviet owner, maybe he knows something

When the battery is full (or nearly full) system voltage drops to 12.6V, with 4 exceptions.
When steady cruising it raises the voltage to 13.x or 14.x (varies with temperature) volts for a few minutes every hour or so.
When coasting and no throttle input it rises to 14.x, similar concept as regenerative braking, capturing wasted energy.
Turning the HVAC blower to high raises the voltage to 14.x.
Turning on the headlights raises the voltage to 14.x, we don’t want headlight brightness changing up and down.
I’m a low mileage driver, about 5-6000 miles per year. I don’t drive to work.
With COVID I’m driving even less. Few visits to family, no road trips.
Some weeks I only drive to the grocery store, one mile each way.
Takes me up to 2 months to burn half a tank of gas.
For 2 years I’ve kept a 10 watt solar panel on the dashboard to help keep the battery full.
I park on a city street; no plug-in access for a battery maintainer.
It does a good job, bringing battery voltage as high as 13.5V after a few hours in the sun.
But with long winter shadows coming and cloudy days it would be nice to get a little extra charging.
What I’ve started doing is turn the headlights on for trips 30 minutes or less, or turn them on for the last part of longer trips.
That keeps the voltage at 14.x volts for some extra charging time.Interesting analysis!  Thank You!

My Shop-Rite supermarket is only 3 miles away, but I almost always take the longer, scenic route–rather than the direct route–so that the engine warms up more completely and the battery gets a better charge.  This way, I drive 7 miles each way instead of only 3.
My routine in the Era of Covid is to do that drive once each week, plus a once a week drive to LIDL for their goodies from Germany, Austria, France, and Italy, and a once a week jaunt to Costco, during their early-morning “senior hour”.   The LIDL trip is ~8 miles each way, and Costco is exactly 7 miles each way.

Old sway bar bushings are sometimes to blame if a creaking noise is present.That’s what I’ve been hearing and honestly I haven’t checked that yet. Thx for the advice!Could be a dry U-joint too. You could try spraying some WD-40 on the sway bar bushings and see if the noise goes away. If it does not then it might be time to drop the driveshaft for a joint inspection.I look into that too. Thx!I do live in east Texas so I don’t have much in corrosive weather but it does get really hot here the majority of the time.Could old leaf spring bearings be the problem too?Leaf springs don’t have bearings, they have bushings that connect them and plastic pads between the springs. And yes, they can squeak. Typically you can make the squeak by bouncing the rear if it is the springs.
Could also  be a worn or missing body mount bushing.Okay so I jumped on my truck bed and it was squeaking a lot so I’m 99% sure it’s my bushings for my leafs springs. That are not rusted so I shouldn’t hafto get new springs just pushing. My sway bar links are bad too. My sway bar bushings seem fine tho. I think I found my issues. Thank y’all very much!

There could be one or more other reasons for that code.It sounds like your mechanic wild guessed, lost, and is now defaulting to the wiring because he does not have any idea.
You might consider providing more info on the car along with exactly what code was set. An O2 code could be pre-converter or post converter. My assumption, right or wrong, is that it’s the latter.I gather that O2 sensors and catalytic converter issues can be tricky to diagnose.
But when your mechanic starts blaming the wiring, the wiring harness, or “the computer”… it’s a sign to me, at least, that he’s out of ideas. You need to try another mechanic.I agree with @ledhed75 - this should be a straightforward diagnosis, you mechanic appears to be in over their head.  I’d find another one.


 Grace-37:

Many months ago I had my oxygen sensors replaced on my car. However, the check engine light keeps coming on with the code for faulty oxygen sensor. The mechanic thinks it says this because of a wiring problem and that I should get the electrical system fixed.


Well . . . ?!
Is he capable of diagnosing and repairing this problem?
From what you describe, the answer might be no
Because if he was able to do so, you wouldn’t be here asking for help
Seems to me the underlying reason(s) for the oxygen sensor fault codes was never properly diagnosed in the first place
All fuses related to the oxygen sensor(s) good?
No obvious wiring problems, such as rat damage?
How about you tell us which exact code(s) you have?
Not the description, just the code itself
Such as P0130

I expect that the next stab in the dark will be “bad gas”.   That (or “the computer”) seems to be the default diagnosis for a lot of clueless mechanics.What does your mechanic say his scan tool is saying about the sensor performance? Are they providing expected data? The sensors are showing varying readings? Or nothing? So they are “broke”?",,,,

ThanksWhat engine and how many miles?Could be condensation or something more seriousIt’s a 2007 with the 2.0 turboAbout 76000 milesWhat city? Denver? Miami? Temps change? Rain? Dry and sunny?These engines have a couple of issues… the crankcase evac systems are a bit weak and allow exhaust gas recirculation with oil mist to go into the intake. That can cause carbon to build up on the intake valves. You may have had a bit of excess moisture and egr products that got ingested when you started the car after sitting 4 hours. Keep an eye on the oil levels and while you are in there, the coolant level. If it doesn’t happen again, don’t worry. But keep an eye on oil levels as these engines tend to use more oil as they age.

While auto parts stores such as AutoZone or O’Reilly can load-test your battery, it is possible for an old battery to have a “surface charge” which is sufficient to pass the load test, but insufficient to reliably start your engine.  If you still have the original battery, I’d probably purchase and install a new one before spending money to have a shop diagnose it.  Hope that helps.adding to @bcohen2010 advice…

743,Alero wont cold start unless I use starting fluid,Maintenance/Repairs,15,2.2k,"I have a 2002 Olds Alero 3.4, 140,000 miles. My issue is my car will crank and wont start. I initially thought it was a security issue so I had Milzy Motorsport remove the security out of my pcm and still no luck. However usually if I change a part like unplug a pcm and re-flash it then put it back in my car it will start right up, however if my car sits over night and gets cold it wont start, But if I shoot a little bit of starting fluid in there and crank it it’ll fire a bit and then crank it again it starts right up. So I have come to the conclusion the system needs primed to start but I cant seem to find out why. It makes good compression, spark is good and fuel pressure is 58psi and then after the pump primes for like 10 seconds it sits at 50psi waiting for the vehicle to start. I’m at a complete loss because I can get this thing start it drives around really well its still really fast and it’ll start when I turn it off until it sits for about 6 hours or however long it takes for the motor to completely cool off. Also I took this to a shop they had it for 8 weeks and gave up on it. So feel free to respond, seriously any help is much appreciated.Have you tried the key dance: turn the key to Run, not all the way to Start. The fuel pump should run for a few seconds then turn off. In a quiet place you can probably hear it.Turn the key back to Off then to Run again and let the fuel pump run and turn off. Each key dance brings fuel and fuel pressure up to the engine. After a couple or more key dances, turn the key all the way to Start. What happens?Leave the fuel pressure gauge on overnight. If the injectors are leaking down, the car will be harder to start. @shanonia’s suggestion is to identify this exact problem.
I’d also hook up an OBD 2 scanner to read the coolant and air temp sensors in real time as the car starts and warms up to see if the sensors are providing the correct signal. If the ECU doesn’t know it is cold, it won’t add extra fuel.Yes I have tried that, I also have tried a new Fuel Pressure Regulator and a PumpOkay! Ill hook my laptop up to my pc and see! also dont be afraid to ask for a lot im no noob when it comes to cars but what mine is doing is something I have never seen before and obviously not many people considering a shop gave my car back to me You spray starting fluid into intake and car starts.
Shop says you have no fuel delivery issue.
Yep. Odd.
Good spark. Proper fuel pressure. Injectors are firing.
Fuel IS being sprayed into combustion chamber?Yeah i’m so confused, my next guess is a coolant temperature sensor. It has been reading weird lately. When I have time i’m going to hook up my laptop and check to see what the car reads it at and then compare it to outside temp. But if the sensor thinks the engine is warm when its not it wont run a little rich to give it the ability to cold start so that may be the issue but doesn’t sound promising. I might go to a junk yard and pick up a whole new fuel system however I feel that’s not the case because my tune is running fine and when it starts it had no problem making 230hp. and no the tune is not the issue I guarantee it a %100


 Ryan_Breiding:

my tune is running fine and when it starts it had no problem making 230hp. and no the tune is not the issue I guarantee it a %100


By “my tune” do you mean modifications? If so, what? And can you restore it to original?My 3.4 makes 180hp. Does a tune on a non turbo motor really give you 50 more hp?No an actual tune I had done and a few mod that I have reversed to trouble shootWell I know its not the coolant temperature sensor. anybody have ideas?My car has been doing the same thing since I got it I’m thinking just keep it plugged in overnight so it does start cuz my Pontiac does the same thing 2 but only during the winterIt sounds like your driving my 02 Alero 3.4l
I have done the same things you have done and even thought of doing by changing out the complete fuel system so don’t waist your time or money it doesn’t change anything.
Now before I had this car it was my buddy’s daughters and I had it running for her after a no start issue by swapping out the fuel pump and it ran great for two years. Then they came back with another no start but it wasn’t the pump and but I got it running and it was all good and that’s when I learned that the starter fluid was the pre-day process and they didn’t want to deal with it anymore and sold me the car. Well after playing around with every wire under the hood I did it no more pre-day spay it would start no matter what time or not or cold again nothing was replaced and I was happy and then almost a year to the day it went back to the pre-day spray then grow to if it sat longer then 6 hours now it’s down to 4 I have redone everything I did before with no luck. And now I’m starting to believe it’s is an issue with the crank sensor from a post I had read somewhere else just recently. I believe when I got lucky it was do to messing with that harness in the past so when the money allows I’ll change the sinsor and possibly the harness because the last thing it could be if that doesn’t work is it’s just far enough out of time maybe to not cold start if that is possible. But if you get to try this crank sensor theary before I do let me know how it goes and I’ll do the same
Good luckContinuing the discussion from Alero wont cold start unless I use starting fluid:
Did you ever figure out the problem?

My 3.4 makes 180hp. Does a tune on a non turbo motor really give you 50 more hp?


This is news to me too.  I do not believe that it is possible to boost the power output of a NA motor by “tuning” the computer.  If such a thing were possible, it would come that way from the factory.

Anyone have any idea what caused it/ what I need to do to fix it??image3024×4032 1.62 MBWas there bird droppings in this area before? Bird droppings can etch the paint and do permanent damage to car paint if you let it sit for a while.The sun was not out, very cloudy day in the late evening. There have been no bird droppings in that area to my knowledge, and the engine hadn’t been running for at least an hour prior to washing aside from my moving it a few yards to get closer to the hoseThe car also hasn’t been turned on in over 24 hoursWas the hood ever been repainted before?How old is this vehicule?I’m going to be blunt here
You’ll have to post a better picture, one which clear as day shows what you’re talking about
As far as bad paint . . . the only obvious problem I see is that the Camry in the background definitely needs a repaintIt’s a 2017 and the maintenance records were extremely well kept/updated and no paint job was mentioned.

Dull and/or rough?
How often is the Mazda waxed?
What kind of climate do you get?
Where I’m at, the climate is brutal to pretty much every single vehicle that gets parked outside
Has the engine ever overheated?
I’m asking because I’ve encountered some cars where engine problems generated such heat, so that the paint on the hood was affectedAwesome!
It feels no different than the rest of the paint so I’d say smooth. I haven’t waxed the vehicle yet since I got it a couple months ago, and I’m not sure when the previous owner had it done.
The engine has not overheated while I’ve owned it at least and based on the maintenance records I don’t think it has in general.
As for climate, Im in Alabama and right above the Gulf of Mexico so it’s extremely humid here and tends to be veryyyy hot in the summer. Wish so much I had a garage to keep it in.
It’s just so strange this wasn’t visible whatsoever until today.If the problem is the white strips surrounding the dark spots, that would be an issue with the clear coat.  It could be failure of the clear from the sun or other contaminants and would only get worse.  Have a detail shop polish and wax to see what happens.The picture isn’t close enough to confirm but it could be moisture in the clear coat. Moisture can get embedded into the clear coat if there is water between the clear coat and a plastic cover. The condition should go away after exposure to the sun. This shouldn’t occur after only washing the car.Thanks so much! That was my guess… crazy that it happened so soon but I did some searching and apparently it’s a thing for Mazdas",,,,
745,Toyota Rav4 grinding noise,Maintenance/Repairs,8,4.8k,"Hello, I have quite the dilemma with my 2009 Rav4. I have taken it to 3 different mechanics (1 was a shop mechanic, 1 was the mechanic at the dealer, and 1 was my Dad who is a retired mechanic). Anytime I am driving between 30-45ish miles per hour my car randomly makes this grinding noise when I accelerate. It immediately stops when I take my foot off the pedal and seems to happen more often on hills, corners, and when the car has been running/driving for awhile. The shop mechanic couldn’t pinpoint it, the dealership said it is the transmission however couldn’t be more specific, and my Dad thinks it is the heat shield (which he has tried adjusting many times and the noise keeps coming back). Anyone have any experience with this? It is driving me nuts and doesn’t sound very safe…


 ToyotaLady86:

my Dad thinks it is the heat shield (which he has tried adjusting many times and the noise keeps coming back).


If the noise stops when the heat shield is adjusted ( there is no adjustment for heat shield ) just find a muffler shop and have the shield fixed properly.
You may have to pay for a shop to actually find the problem if it is not the shield and your vehicle should be taken to an independent shop not a dealer at 9 years old.I’d give your Dad a pass as he’s retired but  surprising neither of the two shops would use these to locate the source of the noise- https://www.amazon.com/Steelman-97202-Wireless-ChassisEAR-Diagnostic/dp/B00123J79O 118
Very surprising the dealership would come to that conclusion but offer no basis for it. Did you pay them for a diagnostic?Hey TwinTurbo, thanks for the advice, yeah he doesn’t have a shop anymore just his garage but I will send him this link maybe he know a good shop with on. I am also surprised neither the shop nor the dealership used that device…and of course I paid for diagnostic (I know I am a sucker haha)!!!Hey Volvo_V70, The noise doesn’t stop, it got a bit quieter and then got louder over a few weeks back up to how it was. I think he jimmied something (and said “adjust”) but I have already tried at the local shop (and told them I thought it was the heat shield)…they weren’t helpful.Hi there! I have a 2010 Toyota RAV4 and have the exact same problem. It’s starting to scare my passengers the noise is getting so loud. I recently had the wheel bearings replaced and a new alternator.

You started your post mid idea, lots of stuff in the beginning is not there.  Are you replying to a radio show or newspaper article?  Those are all re runs and have been for a long time.
Back up a bit and start at the beginning.   Under what conditions do you hear the noise, where does it seem to come from.  When did it startHi, I had the same thing happening.

p.p.s. the car in question is a Scion tC, it shares its engine with Toyota Camry and Rav4I will assume you’ve never watched one of these videos. If you can’t find the answer to your question by watching it, maybe you should have a shop do your oil changes.

You’re right I had a gross conceptual error about what that component of the oil filter cartridge is for.
Thanks to your video, I’ve now also learned that I’m missing one of my splash guards. Darn it!You need a special tool to remove the cartridge filters from Toyota made vehicules…You can buy it at most autoparts stores.I  bought one for my 2012 CorollaI can see the need for a special tool.
The plug would seem to only be there as a drain.
Seems to be a more complicated solution than a simple spin on filter. Anyone know why Toyota did this?Maybe to reduce the amount of oil going in landfills? Some credit for that in the EU?Lots of European cars have them. Mercedes and bmw. My opel has a metal canister that has a 7/8” hex and a square drive. Take your pic. I bought a cast alum socket for my Toyota. They do make a cast steel one for more money. The stamped versions are junk.Dorman sells an aluminum filter canister for about $20 and having 2 makes it much quicker to get out from under the car. When the dirty one drops off wipe off the block housing and screw on the fresh filter/housing, install the plug and get on with it.

Acceleration lag is another issue, but without the CEL illuminated, needs hands on diagnosis.VW recommends oil changes every 10k or annually, which seems like a long time to me. https://www.schworervolkswagen.com/blog/vw-oil-change-service-intervals/ If you’re adding a quart or two in 10k you have no reason to worry.

Fiat Chrysler Facing Class Action Over Alleged Engine Oil Consumption Defect 2
A class action claims a number of Fiat Chrysler-made vehicles suffer from a defect that causes excessive engine oil consumption.





I have the FCA 2.4L multiair engine and it is burning about 1 qt every 3,000 miles. Does this seem excessive?My understanding is that most manufacturers define excessive as somewhere around 600 to 1,000 miles per quart, so you’re still pretty far from that.thanks…hit 35,000 miles and it was like turning a switch, suddenly needing to add oil once or twice between changes.
Used to burn about nothing in 6,000 miles.Even if, as your Jeep ages, the oil consumption doubled, you still won’t be in the “excessive” rangeI had a couple of used cars that burned oil when I was younger, but my previous GM, Ford, and Jeep didn’t need top offs between changes.
Apparently there are ongoing discussions about whether it’s the valve seals, rings, or thin oil.

I really like the engine and 9 speed trans, 30 mpg when I take it easy, plenty of pep when needed.Engines today burn a little more oil than in the old days. “This is not your father’s Oldsmobile” or Jeep.Wouldn’t surprise me, I’ve heard newer cars are designed with thinner oils to increase mpg, this one takes 0w20 syntheticVery few engines that I work on require any oil to be added between 10,000 mile oil changes.
There are exceptions that have carbon stuck piston rings or the complexity of the multi-air system that may have valve guide/seal problems.
My 1996 Dodge has consumed one quart every 1,500 miles for the last 20 years. For a late model engine to consume a quart every 3,000 miles does not sound pleasing, in recent years there have been a number of engines with oil consumption problems and it gets worse as time goes on. .I’m glad I caught it before it clattered or stalled, some Jeep owners are changing at 6K miles and losing 3 qts in between, which is enough to cause serious problems.Did you mean to say burn less oil?
I had a Flathead six, no oil filter, from the non-detergent oil days that was lucky to get 200 miles per quart of oil.  But was good at keeping mosquitoes away.


 flashfyre:

Wouldn’t surprise me, I’ve heard newer cars are designed with thinner oils to increase mpg, this one takes 0w20 synthetic


I have noticed that a lot of manufacturers specify these really thin oils to increase MPG, perhaps at the cost of higher oil consumption and higher engine wear.  It is an interesting question what type of oil is best, once the warranty runs out of course.  A lot of models which are sold overseas specify 0W20 oil for the U.S. market, but recommend 5W30 elsewhere in the world, which leads me to believe that 5W30 is probably best for those engines.

I have the FCA 2.4L multiair engine and it is burning about 1 qt every 3,000 miles. Does this seem excessive?


No
Not excessive
It’s well within the acceptable range
Not even close to engine replacement/repair criteriaa couple people have already mentioned that up thread.
a jeep owner on youtube documented his saga with the problem. under 55k dealer considers 1 qt per 1,000 miles acceptable, over 55K 1 qt per 500 miles. not sure if that is an FCA or local spec.
problem he faced is his other vehicles don’t burn oil, so he wasn’t watching it. 3 weeks before his dealer scheduled oil change the engine started clattering due to all the oil escaping.
it took a six month community campaign on facebook, but the owner of the dealership finally bought the jeep back.

Even if you have the best . . . whatever that actually means . . . vehicle, if you don’t check and maintain the routine stuff, it could cost you dearlyi know … so many people don’t check their oil now, assuming the engines are sealed well enough to get them to a six month oil change.
caught me by surprise, it was suddenly low, but no clattering, engine stall, spun bearings, etc. that have affected other owners.

What does that mean?
the two leading theories involve oil ring seating and valve stem seals.

751,Wheel Rim Damage - Lug nuts put on wrong,Maintenance/Repairs,3,228,"I have a Toyota yaris 2008.  An auto shop put my summer tires *on their own rims) on in the spring.  A friend changed my summer tires to my winter tires on their own rims, and discovered that the lugs nuts had been put on wrong in the spring and there was some wear and burrs on the holes of the rims with the summer tires
where they go on over the bolts on the wheel.  The auto shop wants to file the holes down (this happened on all four rims) rather than give me new rims, and work out a deal if I buy new summer tires (which I will need) and not charge me for the tire mounting and balancing.  Aside from the deal not being a good one financially for me,   I am not so comfortable with this “solution” and wonder if it is safe and if anything else was damaged on the bolts or any other part connected with the rotating rims while I was driving or while I am now driving with the winter tires on? I am a female, so also feel like they see an easy target…It depends on how much they need to file off. If it’s just removing burrs, it should be OK as long as they paint the bare metal if the rims are painted.I’d like to know how they were “put-on wrong”.  Did they cross thread them, which does not sound like the problem you are attempting to describe?  Did they put them on upside down, which could cause burrs but a little grinding would take care of this.
The lug nuts have a tapered side and the holes in the wheels are tapered.  As long as they go tapered to tapered, you are OK.  A few small burrs at the top of the holes won’t hurt anything.Until I see pictures of this damage, I’m not ready to condemn the shop
And while you’re at it, show us pictures of the lug nuts in question, as well

753,Rear tire behind driver came off while driving 40mph,General Discussion,30,1.1k,"Hi Everyone, I need some advice.
Our 2020 Kia Telluride went to first oil service and tire rotation today. I picked up the car and drove from the dealership and within 500feet on the road, the car shook, I slowed down and the rear tire flew off in front of my eyes. I heard a lot of metal sound but stopped the car within 15-20 feet without causing any accident.  The dealership sent a tow truck, gave me a loaner, apologized And said we will get everything fixed. Question: Is it safe to drive again or axle&chassis integrity has been compromised. I leased it brand new in Feb and put only 4000 miles on it and love the ride.  Please advice.  Thanks everyone.It is all easily fixable and the car will be on record with the repair.
There will be no lasting effects.The dealership is owning up to the mistake.  They should check and fix any damage.  If you want an extra layer of verification take it to an independent shop and explain what happened and ask them to verify the repairs were done correctly.500 ft? You could see dealership?
So, a tech puts wheel on and no lugnuts? 1 lugnut? All 5 but does not thread them at all? I’m not a tire tech. I wonder what sort of process is used to increase odds of lugnuts being snugged at least? They used air guns, you zip on lugnut so how can it not be tight? You can’t put on a lugnut using a gun with 2 threads engaged.I’m curious about the “technician” who installed the wheel. On my worst, most overworked day regardless of high or low temperatures, headaches, hangovers or all the stress that life sometimes threw at me I never allowed any such mistake to be made. And I’m just an average busted knuckle mechanic. Some people obviously require work that is closely supervised or requires no supervision/scrutiny.People make mistakes. I don’t care who you are or what you do, at some point in your career in the course of doing your work you will make a mistake.
Sounds like the dealership is repairing the damage, if any. There should be no lasting effects of losing the wheel.I found only one lug nut (on the road) on my way back to the dealership.It has never happened in my life after owning cars and driving 3000 miles across USA. It is my wife’s car and glad that my kids and she were not in the car driving on a Freeway.Beats me. How tight or not tight  were the Lug nuts.Back in my hitch-hiking days, I was in an old station wagon on I-40 in Oklahoma when the right rear wheel rolled away.  The axle, etc., hit the pavement at 60 mph, sending up a shower of sparks.  Worried that the gas tank might explode, I opened the door, anticipating jumping out, saw the pavement rushing by, felt the other hitch-hiker on my back, held on.
I carry a torque wrench, check the lugnuts’ torque after somebody has worked on a wheel, same as I would check the oil after an oil change, etc.  It’s not too much to do.

Back in the '70s, I was in the process of rotating the tires on my father’s '66 Galaxie when I was interrupted by a really-important phone call that I had to take.   A few minutes later, I rushed to the car in order to pick up my father from the train station, and at the first turn I heard a sound that could only have been from a loose wheel.   Luckily, I was only a few blocks away from home, returned there, and found that I had failed to fully-tighten the lug nuts on one wheel.
Anyone can make a mistake, but what separates one person–or one shop–from another is the willingness to own-up to the mistake, and to do what is necessary to make things right.Not looking for putting blame. Only asking about the Integrity of axle and chassis. ThanksMake sure the repair order stars exactly what happened so that there is no question about the car when you return it at the end if the lease, and keep the paper work.  I’m sure you know this, but it is still worth mentioning.Air guns are only used to tighten them approximately, then they are tightened the rest of the way after setting the car down. It is most probable that multiple guys were working the same job and there was a communication error somewhere, causing a wheel to not get fully tightened.
In this particular case, I’m guessing they started the lugnuts by hand on all four, and as they went around to finish tightening (probably using a torque stick adapter) they were talking and/or got distracted and missed the last tire, and probably regularly neglect to check the torque on the ground. Just my guess cuz 500 feet is very quick to lose the tire. I would think even partially tightening would get you further than that. Could’ve even over tightened with an impact gun and stripped the threads (idiotic), so that they gave way once road forces kicked in.The only thing that should need replaced is the wheel studs, as they’ll surely be damaged. But they will take care of that easy enough before putting a new wheel on.


 natepuisis_160295:

The only thing that should need replaced is the wheel studs


Seriously ?  The vehicle hit the ground at 40 MPH so there will be more damage than just the wheel studs .Agree.  When I touched the bolts their threads were falling apart.  Luckily the tire just crossed the road and didn’t hit anyone.  On second thought, if the rear brakes are drum style, then yeah it should be probably alright cuz those are heavy duty, but if it is a disc brake system then it’d be good to replace the rotor. Believe it or not, that’s about all I’d expect. And for what it’s worth, I am certified in Michigan for Suspension and Brakes. It’s a Volvo so there’s not a lot of weight back there and it’s front wheel drive as far as I’m aware.

Turn the crank in the normal direction, and then turn it in the opposite direction and see how far it can move before the rotor moves.

 tom418:

No. Damaged dizzys advance the timing because springs break.



 tom418:

Is it possible that a distributor could temporarily seize, resulting in seizing of the camshaft while the crank is still turning, and cause the timing chain to jump?


No, the more likely scenario is the dizzy would seize and break the cam or timing chain.
Check it as Tester suggests. I’ll bet the chain is sloppier than a Twizzler.Tester: I turned the crank cloclwise until I hit “0” TDC, then turned counterclockwise. Rotor started moving when notch on crank pulley was at 5, maybe 6 degrees BTC (there’s an index mark at 8 degrees)That indicates a stretched timing chain.
TesterWell, then time for the repair shop. The FSM says to remove the cylinder head to get to the timing chain cover. I’ve heard some stories (unfounded) of people getting around that, somehow.
If the distributor is making noise, I still have to change that out, no? That one I could do myself. But a timing chain ? -I’m way over my head.I’ve never had to remove the head to replace timing components @tom418. And I’ve replaced quite a few timing chain guide sets on R22 engines. The driver’s side guide was plastic on some models and they failed resulting in the problems you describe and can be replaced with only the valve cover removed. Maybe someone here has access to the Toyota shop manual and can provide the factory details for that work.OLDER TOYOTA 22R TIMING CHAIN OR TIMING COVER INSTALL
TesterRod-Knox:
I do have the FSM for the '79 Celica. They say to remove the cylinder head  then remove the timing chain cover. It was on another website (ToyotaNation) where a poster or two mentioned that it was not necessary to remove the head. I tend to take what’s posted there with a grain of salt. But sometimes the FSM has unnecessary steps, and boy I hope you’re right!
And don’t you know that, according to the FSM, you have to drop the oil pan? Three years after I changed the pan gasket myself. That involved lifting the engine, disconnecting the idler arm, etc.!
They better not have to remove the A/C compressor. Just fixed A/C myself two years ago also.
When this is over, I’ll have to drive this car on Sundays only, and sparingly. It’s a really fun car to drive, looks great,  unlike my Avalon. But it’s time for semi-retirement.
BTW: I have metal chain guides, and it’s a double row chain.The double row chains with metal guides never showed up as a problem for me @tom418. But if the tensioner is failing the front 6-8 pan pan  bolts on each side can be loosened and the front cover can be removed with a little prying down on the pan and with a small screw driver on each side  to allow slipping the timing cover back it can be reinstalled.Well, time for a new chain. I pulled off the valve cover. I found that instead of two links straddling the index mark embossed at the top of the cam sprocket, I have one link riding on top . Clearly the chain jumped one tooth.
I still have to address the distributor. One of the springs for the advance weights in no good, the rotor is sluggish to return after being spun to advance position, etc. I contacted the facility that RockAuto deals with, and was told they can rebuild it: “make a list of what’s wrong” I don’t want the dealer or independent shop charging me for that too.
Mustangman: The chain was very loose on the driver’s side. I stuck a screwdriver between chain and metal guide and I could move it sideways almost an inch!. If I had plastic guides, they’d have been chewed to bits.

757,Life of synthetic oil,General Discussion,22,815,"3 yrs ago I changed to synthetic oil in my 82 vw vanagon. I put about 200 miles/yr on the van and now the oil has 600 miles on it.
Instead of 'miles left on oil. how much TIME should pass before changing oil?
Thanks much…Ken CarterPersonally I think once a year minimum.Barky…Thanks much…Ken CarterHow do those 200 miles accumulate? Is it one long trip or 100 small trips?
The worst thing is frequent small trips. Then, the condensation produced mixes with raw gas and combustion by products to produce acidic oil. Leaving that sit on your bearing surfaces is going to damage them. I have cars that go years between changes because they see very little use but when they do, it is continuous duty and they run clean. Other cars that may see even less mileage, have infrequent short trips and are not as clean running. Those I change at least once a year and preferably before winter storage so they are not basking in acidic oil all winter.Folks…It’s usually small trips, 5 or 10mile round trips. I’m guessing from your reply, it’s time to change my oil based upon my driving pattern, ie, infrequent short trips.
Thanks much…Ken Carterwith that many miles, you might as well go with mineral oil and have no difference, especially for engine technology that oldIf oil looks good on the dipstick, and no signs of moisture under the filler cap, I’d leave it alone myself.I have a 5000 watt Coleman generator I bought 14 years ago after we lost power for 5 days.  I put synthetic oil in it and run it every couple of years to make sure the engine doesn’t freeze up and the gbenerator delivers electricity. I have never used it because the power was out and have no intention of changing the oil until I do.
That 5 day period was the only time in the 50 years we have lived in this house that the power was out more than a few minutes.I bought 5500 W generator a year after 3-days power outage was all over our metro area.
it was collecting dust in somebody’s garage and they were happy to get $150 from me to take it away 
10+ years later… I’m still to have a single outage where I live, but had to rescue my boss at least twice when his power was down for a day or more in his old town 
I was replacing oil every 2-3 years, just as a precaution…You can sleep easy as you are prepared for Y2K.Whaaaaaaaat!?
Prep H, maybe.
Thanks anyway…Ken.Thanks for the info, but what’s this got to do with the price of ‘Pig’s Feet’ in Ozark, Ark?
Thanks anyway, nice try…KenSeeing as I’m mostly alone by myself, and my dipstick is clear, I’d say then, ‘I’m in good company’.

Just curious .My generator has a gasoline engine and oil in the crankcase just like your car. They see about equivalent use. I think changing the synthetic oil in either one yearly is overkill.My generator got used once maybe 15 years ago, I changed the oil afterwards.  Until the riots last month and they cut off electricity to our grid for 15 hours.  I will start it up and run the gas out. It worked fine for 5 hours when we needed it a month ago, but thanks for the reminder, thinking I’ll fog the cylinders do an oil change again. Regarding fogging, my boat guy says do it through the carb because then everything is fogged, but it dies as soon as you try it, now with 4 carbs on my boat I never asked, but just crank it while no start? My 86 2 cycle 90 hp working fine as I live by the old wives tale you do not need to fog a 2 cyl engine as there is oil in the gas. It is an evinrude VRO, I usually run it out of gas but original manual says not to. I disconnected the vro oil supply and premix gas. I guess after 34 years I am not worrying too much. Still plenty of power and let the neighbor borrow the boat to take adults water skiing. So we went out so I could show him the quirks, like you have to increase throttle as tilting it down will kill it or even not start unless tilted up. So his first run through, he has an io boat on another lake hours away he was like geees this has some get up and go.

Changed master cylinder from used car
Swapped diaphragm anyway
Checked for leaks on brake lines and swapped 2 lines to the ABS unit which also ABS unit never worked.

 Kewizzle:

A leaking brake booster won’t prevent you from bleeding the brakes. Is there no fluid or air coming out of the bleeder?No there’s not but like I was manually bleeding it should I try bleeding it with a tool?The proportioning/combination valve might be stuck, this was triggered while the line was leaking. This occurs to close off the leaking circuit.
With the bleeders closed, pump the brake pedal 10 times to build pressure in the system, you might notice a click, the combination valve centering, then bleed the brakes.I don’t think an 06 Impala has a combo valve. The car has a diagonal split system  and the ABS modulator for that function.So I will say my car won’t brake at all at this point but all 3 other calipers are bled and the only caliper that isn’t bled is driver side but no brakes work at all.Is it possible to not have brakes if abs module is broken?


 Kewizzle:

Is it possible to not have brakes if abs module is broken?


Yes., but it would have to several things screwed up so I don’t think that is your problem.
Given the age of your car, I’d guess the brake hose is bad for the caliper that won’t bleed. That part need to be brand new, not used.
Fix that first, then concentrate on the booster. You say you replaced the diaphram? In the booster? Yeah, no, replace the entire unit. Again, new part.Try it with a pressure bleeder.You opened the brake system when you swapped the master cylinder.
Here’s the brake bleeding procedure when that’s done.
SPECIAL PROCEDURES
With the ignition OFF and the brakes cool, apply the brakes 3-5 times, or until the brake pedal effort increases significantly, in order to deplete the brake booster power reserve.
If you have performed a brake master cylinder bench bleeding on this vehicle, or if you
disconnected the brake pipes from the master cylinder, you must perform the following steps:
Ensure that the brake master cylinder reservoir is full to the maximum-fill level.
    With the rear brake pipe installed securely to the master cylinder, loosen and separate the front brake pipe from the front port of the brake master cylinder.
    Allow a small amount of brake fluid to gravity bleed from the open port of the master cylinder.
    Reconnect the brake pipe to the master cylinder port and tighten securely.
    Have an assistant slowly depress the brake pedal fully and maintain steady pressure on the pedal.
    Loosen the same brake pipe to purge air from the open port of the master cylinder.
    Tighten the brake pipe, then have the assistant slowly release the brake pedal.
    Wait 15 seconds, then repeat steps until all air is purged from the same port of the master cylinder.
    With the front brake pipe installed securely to the master cylinder, after all air has been purged from the front port of the master cylinder, loosen and separate the rear brake pipe from the master cylinder, then repeat steps.
    After completing the final master cylinder port bleeding procedure, ensure that both of the brake pipe-to-master cylinder fittings are properly tightened.
    Pressure bleed the hydraulic brake system in order to purge any air that may still be trapped in the system.
    disconnected the brake pipes from the master cylinder, you must perform the following steps:
    If brake pedal height is not sufficient or it is suspected that air is trapped in the system, Using a scan tool, perform the antilock brake system automated bleeding procedure to remove any air that may have been trapped in the BPMV.
    With the rear brake pipe installed securely to the master cylinder, loosen and separate the front brake pipe from the front port of the brake master cylinder.
    Allow a small amount of brake fluid to gravity bleed from the open port of the master cylinder.
    Reconnect the brake pipe to the master cylinder port and tighten securely.
    Have an assistant slowly depress the brake pedal fully and maintain steady pressure on the pedal.
    Loosen the same brake pipe to purge air from the open port of the master cylinder.
    Tighten the brake pipe, then have the assistant slowly release the brake pedal.
    Wait 15 seconds, then repeat steps until all air is purged from the same port of the master cylinder.
    With the front brake pipe installed securely to the master cylinder, after all air has been purged from the front port of the master cylinder, loosen and separate the rear brake pipe from the master cylinder, then repeat steps.
    After completing the final master cylinder port bleeding procedure, ensure that both of the brake pipe-to-master cylinder fittings are properly tightened.

Manual bleeding: Install a proper box-end wrench onto the RIGHT REAR wheel hydraulic circuit bleeder valve.
Install a transparent hose over the end of the bleeder valve.
Submerge the open end of the transparent hose into a transparent container partially filled with GM approved or equivalent DOT-3 brake fluid from a clean, sealed brake fluid container.
Have an assistant slowly depress the brake pedal fully and maintain steady pressure maintain steady pressure.
Loosen the bleeder valve to purge air from the wheel hydraulic circuit.
Tighten the bleeder valve, then have the assistant slowly release the brake pedal.
Wait 15 seconds, then repeat steps 6-8 until all air is purged from the same wheel hydraulic circuit.
Repeat steps 4 - 9 for each caliper in sequence.
After completing the final wheel hydraulic circuit bleeding procedure, ensure that each of the 4 wheel hydraulic circuit bleeder valves are properly tightened.
Fill the brake master cylinder reservoir to the maximum-fill level with GM approved brake fluid from a clean, sealed brake fluid container.
If the brake pedal feels spongy, repeat the bleeding procedure again.
If the brake pedal still feels spongy after repeating the bleeding procedure, perform the following steps:
Inspect the brake system for external leaks.
With the ignition OFF and the brakes cool, apply the brakes 3-5 times, or until the brake pedal effort increases significantly, in order to deplete the brake booster power reserve.
If you have performed a brake master cylinder bench bleeding on this vehicle, or if you

Allow a small amount of brake fluid to gravity bleed from the open port of the master cylinder.
Reconnect the brake pipe to the master cylinder port and tighten securely.
Have an assistant slowly depress the brake pedal fully and maintain steady pressure maintain steady pressure on the pedal.
Loosen the same brake pipe to purge air from the open port of the master cylinder.
Tighten the brake pipe, then have the assistant slowly release the brake pedal.
Wait 15 seconds, then repeat steps 18-22 until all air is purged from the same port of the master cylinder.
With the front brake pipe installed securely to the master cylinder, after all air has been purged from the front port of the master cylinder, loosen and separate the rear brake pipe from the master cylinder, then repeat steps.
After completing the final master cylinder port bleeding procedure, ensure that both of the brake pipe-to-master cylinder fittings are properly tightened.
Pressure Bleeding : Fill the brake master cylinder reservoir to the maximum-fill level with GM approved or equivalent DOT-3 brake fluid.
Install the bleeder cap to the brake master cylinder reservoir.
Check the brake fluid level in the J 29532 , or equivalent.
Connect the J 29532 , or equivalent, to the master cylinder bleeder cap on fluid reservoir.
Charge the J 29532 , or equivalent, air tank to 175-205 kPa (25-30 psi).
Open the J 29532 , or equivalent, fluid tank valve to allow pressurized brake fluid to enter the brake system.
Wait approximately 30 seconds, then inspect the entire hydraulic brake system in order to ensure that there are no existing external brake fluid leaks. Any brake fluid leaks identified require repair prior to completing this procedure.
Install a proper box-end wrench onto the RIGHT REAR wheel hydraulic circuit bleeder valve.
Install a transparent hose over the end of the bleeder valve.
Submerge the open end of the transparent hose into a transparent container partially filled with GM approved or equivalent DOT-3 brake fluid from a clean, sealed brake fluid container.
Loosen the bleeder valve to purge air from the wheel hydraulic circuit. Allow fluid to flow until air bubbles stop flowing from the bleeder, then tighten the bleeder valve.
Repeat steps 34 -36 for each caliper in sequence.
After completing the final wheel hydraulic circuit bleeding procedure, ensure that each of the 4 wheel hydraulic circuit bleeder valves are properly tightened.
Close the J 29532 , or equivalent, fluid tank then disconnect the J 29532 , or equivalent, from the bleeder cap valve, then disconnect the J 29532 , or equivalent, from the J 35589-A .
Remove the bleeder cap from the brake master cylinder reservoir.
Fill the brake master cylinder reservoir to the maximum-fill level.
Slowly depress and release the brake pedal observe the feel of the brake pedal.
If the brake pedal feels spongy, perform the following steps:
Inspect the brake system for external leaks.
Perform the following steps to bleed the Antilock Brake System on vehicles without option JL4.
Connect a scan tool to the vehicle.
Start the engine and allow it to idle.
Depress the brake pedal firmly and maintain steady pressure on the pedal.
Using the scan tool, begin the automated bleed procedure.
Follow the instructions on the scan tool to complete the automated bleed procedure. Release the brake pedal between each test sequence.
Turn the ignition OFF and remove the scan tool from the vehicle.
Fill the brake master cylinder reservoir to the maximum-fill level with GM approved brake fluid from a clean, sealed brake fluid container.
Bleed the hydraulic brake system.
With the ignition OFF, apply the brakes 3–5 times, or until the brake pedal becomes firm, in order to deplete the brake booster power reserve.
Slowly depress and release the brake pedal. Observe the feel of the brake pedal.
If the brake pedal feels spongy, repeat the automated bleeding procedure.
If the brake pedal still feels spongy after repeating the automated bleeding procedure inspect the brake system for external leaks.
Turn the ignition key ON, with the engine OFF; check to see if the brake system warning lamp remains illuminated.
If the brake system warning lamp remains illuminated, Do not allow the vehicle to be driven until it is diagnosed and repaired.
Drive the vehicle to exceed 8 mph/ 13 km to allow ABS initialization to occur. Observe brake pedal feel.
If the brake pedal feels spongy, repeat the automated bleeding procedure until a firm brake pedal is obtained.I followed this tester and all the other calipers would bleed except the driver front caliperSo I uhh reset the caliper pistons and i pushed the brakes and brake fluid came out through the sides of the caliper pistons I think ima put a new brake line and caliper maybe that’ll fix the problemWell not my calipers and brakes are bled and master cylinder is bled so that must mean either abs or brake booster . I hear a hissing sound when pumping my brakes near the vacuum line or like where the master cylinder is connected to the booster but there is no leaking from the cylinder to the booster so I’m assuming I need a whole new booster.Did you check if the brake booster check valve is working?

TesterI took it out and did the blow test and it seemed fine and I checked the rubber that seals it took the booster too and no cracks good shape.Should I take a video?Also id like to say I can push my brake pedal all the way to the floor when the engine is off but its much more firm but it will still goto the floor but when the engine is off halfway pushing to the floor makes a clunking feeling but keeps going.


 Kewizzle:

Should I take a video?


I say No video .  It appears that this repair is beyond your ability and you need this vehicle for work.  Also a brake shop will have an invoice showing what was done . If you don’t solve this completely and you crash into someone while an Uber contractor you will be ruined financially for years.
So use your credit card , ask for relatives for a loan or what ever you need to do to make this a safe vehicle.",,,,

763,Advice on maintaining car I can’t drive,Maintenance/Repairs,28,758,"I’m looking for advice on what to do about my car (2020 Honda Accord), which I haven’t been able to drive due to an injury.  It’s been sitting in my carport for about a month now, and I probably won’t be able to drive it myself for at least another month.
It’s my understanding that leaving a car like this can cause some damage, including draining the battery and potentially causing flat spots on the tires.  I’m really concerned about what damage has already been done, and what more might be done by leaving it sit even longer.  I bought it new about a year ago (December 2019) and haven’t been able to drive it much in that time (less than 3000 miles on it).
What would you recommend I do at this point?  Would it be best to try to turn it on and drive it briefly?
What if I just leave it sitting for another month?
I might be able to enlist a friend to help me out with this in the next week, at least to get it going and possibly drive it once a week.  I can also call AAA if I need to get the battery charged and tires inflated, but I probably won’t be able to get any further maintenance done until I’m able to drive it myself (hopefully mid- to late November).Personally I would let it go until you are ready to drive again. If you need a jump so be it but how many cars spend a couple of months sitting on a car lot (sure I can rationalize anything). Take care of yourself first! Left my car for 2 months and all was fine.It would be nice if you could get a battery maintainer but just leave it be.  You could always start it up and let it run for a while but don’t think it is necessary.  My neighbor’s year old truck has been sitting in his driveway since March when he high tailed it to the cabin to wait the virus out.  His son has used it a couples times but otherwise it has just sat there with no problems.  Lots of cars are going unused now.

> Personally I would let it go until you are ready to drive again.


I fully agree, especially since it’s only on the order of two months.This is a “two year” problem for a car, not a 2 month problem. They sit longer than that on dealer lots.
Stop worrying about it. The car will be fine. It might need a jump to start but if you start it and let it idle for 20 minutes a week or so that will help keep the battery up.Are there rodents in your area?  Letting a car sit for a long time might attract rodents that like to chew on wire insulation. You might use a repellent around the car to repel them. You know your area best and can determine whether you need it or not. If your neighbors haven’t experienced problems, you might be OK.I will give a different opinion.  While a car sits on the dealer lot for months, the dealer has absolutely no stake in the long term condition of the car. You have a big stake. I see no harm in asking a friend to come take the car for a drive, for 10-20 miles as long as it isn’t a teenage nut. Do this now and repeat in two weeks, and that should all be that is needed. (Other people may have more experience than I do about vermin.)Thank you!  I’ve been worrying a bit about it, but obviously it hasn’t been the most pressing thing on my mind 
It sounds like I may need to get it jump-started and checking the air in the tires, but what other kind of issues should I look for when I am able to drive again?  Are “flat spots” a definite thing to be concerned about?
I will probably take it in for a tune-up when I’m able to drive, so hopefully I can get it looked over at that time.Totally agree that I have more personal stake, but to be honest, it may be a little challenging to get help from a friend right now.  This friend has been helping me out with rides to medical appointments, so I’m trying not to ask for too much else for now.  And it sounds like I might need to get it jump-started and tires inflated a bit, so that adds to it as well.
What’s the worst case if I do leave it for a further month?You won’t need a tune up for 60-90,000 miles.  The 60’s are gone.I’m not sure, though I did have a mouse in my apartment a few months ago, possibly a result of nearby restaurants doing less business due to the pandemic.
The car is parked in a large parking lot with many other tenants’ cars, under a wooden awning (not in an enclosed garage).  We’ve also been having 90-degree weather recently, so would they be likely to go in a car when it’s not cold out and when the car hasn’t been run recently?I’m due for an oil change at least, since it’s been almost a year since I bought the car.  I thought perhaps they could take a look and see if there’s any other damage from letting it sit though?


 digitalmaven:

I will probably take it in for a tune-up


That is a outdated term , Vehicles really don’t get tuned up like they did years ago.  I doubt if you will get flat spots but if you are able to start the vehicle yourself and just move it enough to turn the tires a little once in a while you will be fine .
We bought an holdover new vehicle that the dealer had on the lot for 7 months . They had to jump it for us to test drive. That battery lasted 5 years and the tires were fine also .  You are worrying too much.Good to know.  I mostly just wanted to get the oil changed and fluid levels and tires checked, but the car is pretty new, so hopefully there won’t be many issues.
I’ve already had to let it sit for for a little bit this year, and so far it’s been ok. Not ideal, but this year hasn’t been a normal one either.

You are worrying too much.

Very true, and perhaps an understatement!   I definitely tend to worry, and being mostly cooped up at home and unable to drive has made it so much worse.  I will try to focus on some other things and deal with this when I’m healed and able to drive again.
Thank you!

But, don’t put it past an unscrupulous mechanic to claim that it needs one.
A woman whom I used to know was the recipient of her father’s '80s-vintage Buick, and because she lives in Manhattan, she put less than 2k miles per year on the odometer.    Her mechanic convinced her that she needed to replace the spark plugs, the air filter, and God-only-knows what else every 12 months.   Despite my telling her that anything beyond an oil change was a bizarre “oversell”, she continued to patronize that thief’s establishment.It will be far better for the battery to use a maintainer or periodic charging rather than letting it run down, then get a jump.

If you are worried, then:

Sprinkle some cayenne pepper around the engine compartment.
Spread a few clothes dryer freshener sheets in the car and trunk.
While my advice was to get a friend to drive it, it doesn’t mean I want you to worry if you are not able to do it. My suggestion was really just to have a slight improvement.  You have identified what I would call the immediate worst case: low battery and flat-spotting nice new tires. If you decide to move the car a couple feet, be sure to let it idle for 15 minutes to boost the battery. And I agree with the others that you might not either a jump start or have a tire problem.
If you are in a smaller city, think about whether your car salesman will help out by coming over and going for a spin.  You gave him a good commission. And if not, believe us when we say you are over-worrying the car situation. Most likely, it will be fine after two months.Yeah just go out there and start it for a minute or 2 every other week, and maybe roll it back or forward a foot or too. Job done; no big deal.


 natepuisis_160295:

764,Can a Serial Number on a car part lead to the owner of the car?,Maintenance/Repairs,16,11.6k,"My mailbox was hit over the weekend.  There were car parts left behind.  One of the pieces had a serial number on it.  Is there anyway to use that number to find the car who did it?Doubtful, unless they left behind an entire fender or hood. The part number will help identify the year, make and model however. If the parts have a body color, or there’s paint scuff off on the post that will help also. Have you reported this to the Police? I know in some areas they still respond to hit and split crashes.
If you can provide year, make , model and color they’ll have something concrete to work with.
With the above information you can also check around the local body shop’s for an identical vehicle coming in for repairs.
BenzmanIf the number left on the part is truly a serial number and not a part number, then it should match the VIN number of the car, and can be traced through the state motor vehicle records by the police (unless your state allows public access to their data base).You need to contact the police but don’t be surprised if they are unhelpful. I faced a similar situation once in NYC and a patrolman simply shrugged and said, “if you didn’t see them do it you haven’t a case.” So, try it yourself and see.An example of this is when they found the rear axle from the truck used in the OK bombing and traced it back to the actual vehicle. There are many examples where forensics have been used to track down a vehicle with the smallest shred of evidence left behind. It comes down to desire and $$$. First, you have to be sure that is a UNIQUE identifying number. Likely, a body part does not have a serial number but rather a mold number or date code. That would only help to identify the make/model and year of manufacture. Any exterior paint color might ID the color of the car for that component. But really, who would go to such extremes for a mailbox? No authoritative body is going to launch an investigation over a damaged mailbox.Are you sure this is a serial number? More than likely it is simply a parts number that is molded in and that number may be on a million other cars with identical parts, especially if the parts are minor plastic body fittings.
Part numbers are often molded in and are raised letters/numerals; serial numbers are usually stamped or are molded into a separate tag such as the dashboard VIN plate, etc.
An example of this is when they found the rear axle from the truck used in the OK bombing and traced it back to the actual vehicle.

The problem is…MOST police are NOT going to do that kind of investigation unless someone was killed.Unless you know who did it, it certainly is not worth the effort to track it down.  Mail boxes are not that expensive.  Be happy they have a car repair and they likely will not remember doing it, but they will remember the hang-over and hopefully mom and pop will ground them for a month.I thought I covered that pretty well in the last sentence of my post.I have a similar prob. But they hit my car and destroyed my passenger side. There is a big drag racing problem here in Astoria Queens NYC, in fact local news was just here 1 wk ago doing a story on it. I was in my car parked at the curb when 6-7 drag racing cars came tearing around the corner & the lead car smashed into my side & continued on even faster. I tried to give chase but couldn’t even catch up to the last car in the line.
Back at the site I retrieved a piece of their car & it has a QR code & ID number. I’ve been trying everything online to use that number to just get the make and model. And then I know there are like 2 or 3 body shops these muscle car kids use over here. And I was going to follow up with them & police, IF I could only get the make & model.
ES0053707102 is the number on it. If anyone knows a way to look that # up please let me know.
Thank you!

Why would you wait? They comitted a crime of hit and run, the cops will take that up. They will look for cars registered in the area based on your description and local body shops for vehicles like it. Getting component info will require cooperation from vehicle mfr and they may not serialize certain body and or trim parts making them traceable.

I would not have advised that.  That was the time to call the police.So if you caught the guy, so what?  So their insurance or non-insurance would pay for the damage to your car?  Or you want them in jail?  Let you insurance company do the work if it is worth it, and let the police take the action they deem appropriate and go on with your life.

As far as the mail box, I noticed the snow plow ate the neighbor’s post a couple days ago.  Too late now to do anything till spring so he just propped it back up and screwed some 2x4 splints.  Actually the city will pay for the damage if it met regulations.  I noticed some huge divits in the lawns too as the plow drivers gain experience for another season.

Circa 1960, my aunt’s nifty '48 Ford was parked in front of their house  overnight.  In the wee hours of the morning, a drunk barreled down a perpendicular street, T-boned her immaculate old Ford, and left it on the lawn.  Luckily, the offender got stuck in the soft ground, and was still spinning his wheels when the Nassau County cops showed up and put the cuffs on him.
My uncle rewarded my aunt for her loss by buying her a “new” '54 Ford, which I assume was paid for by the drunk’s insurance company.Contact the police and your insurer. There are a lot of cameras on light poles these days. Maybe the accident was captured on one of them. If you wait too long, the video will be erased. Make the calls ASAP. You need to tell them where and when, as close to the hour and minute it occurred.

For reasons that I will never understand, many people seem to have the bizarre notion that mechanical breakdowns will  always take place in their own driveway, or some other location that is both safe and convenient.And misinformation from parts suppliers does not help things either. This bogus info is from partsgeek…cut and pasted below. The inference of course is that you have an advance warning.
When your timing belt is giving out, your engine will begin to misfire. You may hear high-pitched noises coming from your engine, which is an indication that your timing belt is loose. Your engine will idle roughly, your emissions will increase and your gas mileage will go down.The change interval on my 2006 Sienna with the 3.3 V6 is 7yr/90k miles. If you have never changed the belt you are 9 years overdue, that’s kind of pushing it.
Ed BAccording to Gates.com 1 ( the largest timing belt manufacturer, the 3.3 litre V6 is non interference.Unlike some other posters I won’t be judgmental. The difference is that with a noninterference engine a broken timing belt is usually an inconvenience (sometimes major) while with an interference engine it’s an expensive calamity.I appreciate your sticking to the facts.

766,"How do 20,000-mile oils work? Change filter at 10K?",General Discussion,54,1.4k,"Special oil filters?
Thank you.Personally, I’m skeptical of these extended change oils, be it 10K or even 20K miles.
Having said that…I’d just stick to changing the oil filter when you do get around to changing the oil.I think that the oil companies should include a Bible, a rabbit’s foot, and a four leaf clover with the oil purchase, so that car owners can pray and wish for a good outcome with that type of ridiculously-extended oil change interval.
I assume the way they work is that you add new oil and a new filter, drive for about 11,000-12,000 miles, then the oil pressure light comes on, the engine makes loud noises, and you say “oh sh**, I never should have trusted that snake oil”, as you tow your car to the shop for a replacement engine.
Seriously, though, since most engines use some oil–some more than others–the big “catch” of extended oil change intervals is that you still have to check the oil level frequently, and top off as needed–which negates any “benefit” from the long oil change intervals.  At least when the oil change interval was every 3,000 to 5,000 miles, most people never ran out of oil unless their engine was on its last leg anyways.They work for 3-4 oil changes…then you’ll need a new engine.To me, these 10-20K miles oils are either a), a solution in search of a problem, or b), an excuse for people who just can’t be bothered to change their oil at regular intervals.
Personally, I want fresh oil (and a filter) in my engine a couple of times a year. It’s cheap insurance for the engine’s useful life, and I plan for it accordingly (the oil changes).
It’d be different if suddenly there was a shortage of engine oil, and we all had to extend to 10K miles. But last I checked, you can get a 5 qt jug of Mobil 1 synthetic for under $30.
The older I get, the less I seem to understand other people.I imagine that after about 10 or 15k miles, they work similarly to homeopathic medicines. 
If you dilute oil with dirt and gasoline, it becomes even more oily! Oil has a memory. It remembers when it was clean and so it behaves as though it’s clean.BrianH UK
I think it is down to cleanliness of the oil. Less you keep the oil clean the more it grinds the bores out. My redblock Volvo engine at 500k miles used 1 litre per 5k. The compression was reducing but still in specification. Using bypass filtration, down to 1micron, and 0/30 fully synthetic oil. The oil was sampled every 6 months and sent to a lab to be analysed. Using the lab advise I changed the oil from 70 to 150k!!!
These items to achieve this were purchased in the USA.
Manufactures want to sell new cars.

If I’m correct by this, your Volvo uses Propane? If so, I’m not surprised that your analysis shows that you could go years between changing since Propane burns so much cleaner than gasoline does. While that’s excellent for you, that is unfortunately, irrelevant to engines that burn gasoline.


 pyrolord314:

Propane burns much much cleaner than gas. City Bus’s that switched to Propane or Natural Gas have been able to triple their oil change interval. You can NOT compare oil cleanliness from a vehicle that runs on Propane to an engine that runs on gas.I drive 6-7 thousand a year  on my 2012 Camry. It has 54000 on it and I change it once a year and the oil stays so clean I have trouble reading it on the dipstick.
I buy whatever name brand full synthetic is on sale or has a good coupon, usually Mobile One or Pennzoil but this last time there were no coupons so I bought a 6 Qt box of Havoline for $19.99. I changed it Aug 8 and it is still so clear that the only way I can read the dipstick is to lay it on a paper towel.
If I was driving 20,000 a year and was out of warranty, I might try an oil that promised 20000 miles because that kind of driving is pretty easy on oil, but I would not go longer than a year.
The trouble is, unless you are operating a fleet, you have no way of gathering real evidence to support what you believe about oil.

Not in cars, they don’t. 1M miles on a truck diesel is not uncommon. Generally uncommon to get a car diesel past 300K miles.

Many posters to this site have seen 400K and more on gas engines in cars.Aren’t diesel engines far “heartier” than gasolinengines?

Not the same dilution rate. Some of those rigs can hold 10+ GALLONS of oil. The oil does get contaminated, but the dilution would be far lower due to the amount of oil. By comparison they typical car engine takes 5-6 quarts.Yeah, it’s a myth that car diesels far outlast car gas engines. I read an article about a million mile Mercedes diesel. Turns out he had the engine rebuilt every 250,000 miles.Cars that have that interval have large oil sumps. That means they have a lot more buffering additives than for a similarly sized engine with a smaller sump. My guess is that you are thinking of European consumer vehicles with very high oil change intervals, like BMW and Mercedes Benz.  You also use the specific grade they recommend so that there are sufficient additives to need the demands of a long change interval.",,,,
767,Extended vacation car storage,General Discussion,15,7.0k,"We are leaving for a 6 month “excursion” soon(retirement;yeah!). I will be leaving my 2008 Camry and 2009 Prius in the garage. What do I need to do, if anything to prepare them for that time period? Gas-full/empty?, oil-change or wait? Tires-will they be damaged? battery-disconnect? Stuff I haven’t thought of, besides locking the garage door?I’d fill up the tank with non-ethanol gas treated with Stabil.  I’d make sure the tires are very full of air, then I’d hook up my battery maintainers (low voltage chargers that only charge when necessary.)  Have oil changed just before storage and any other maintenance that’s due.  DIsconnect the battery if you want to.Carefully read your Pruis’ owners manual, hybrids don’t like long periods of storage.For a conventional car, I don’t think 6 month storage is a big deal.  When I was in the Navy, a lot of people would drive their cars tot he long term storage lot on base and go on a cruise for 6 months or more, and on return, go to the lot, start up their car and head out, sometimes cross country for a well earned leave.
The biggest problem was the high rate of accidents within the first 48 hours after return to the states because people simply forget how to drive.  One guy in the shop, who had a very high degree of common sense, hit a sign within a couple hours of returning.  Someone asked him if he just didn’t see the sign and he responded “I saw it, I just forgot that I was the one driving”.Good point on the Prius.  That $7,000 battery will degrade by sitting unused for 6 months.I don’t think 6 months will bother either car…An oil change is a good idea, pump the tires up to maximum pressure and fill the gas tanks but don’t over-fill them…And yes, I would get some expert advise regarding the high-voltage Prius battery…My hybrid has a warning for non-use for more than a month or two.  6 months is looong.The '07 Camry Hybrid manual states that:
""If the vehicle is to be parked for a long time, the hybrid battery will discharge gradually. To keep the hybrid battery in good condition, drive the vehicle at least once every several months . . . If the hybrid battery becomes fully discharged and the vehicle will not start even with a jump start to the 12 volt battery, contact your Toyota dealership.""
Granted, the paragraph uses the nebulous words “several months”. Several, well that could be ANYTHING more that two! (Just to cover Toyota’s back-side.)
Everything is written in the Prius’ User’s Manual about long term storage - read it - it says everything you and your friend need to know.
If you don’t own a Prius 2010 or cannot find a 2010 manual, ask a dealer about it.
Above information is from a factory sponsored Prius forum…In the training I’ve had for Prius service (aftermarket, not Toyota training), the current thinking is that after 2 months of non-use the battery pack starts to degrade, and may have an adverse effect on the long-term life. Do you have a trusted friend or family member who might enjoy driving a Prius once a week for a few months?I don’t know about the newest Prius, but Toyota has stuck to the NiMH type battery for its drive battery, and they don’t store well once they have received their initial charge.  Toyota has also not provided any type of provision to charge that battery externally.  Toyota has avoided the L-ion batteries as they don’t take as many charge cycles as the NiMH, but they do store quite well even after their initial charge.
When I was in the Navy, the backup batteries used for aircraft INS systems was NiCad.  They were not charged in by the aircraft so they had to be removed and conditioned every 90 days or when ever a pilot forgot to turn off the INS after shutting down the engines.  Based on that, I would guess that 90 days would be absolute tops.  NiCad and NiMH are very similar technologies.NiCads prefer to be stored dead…But most other types will not tolerate being stored dead…
Another factor, how big a parasitic load does the Prius put on the stored battery? Does one dare to disconnect it?I wouldn’t dare disconnect it, HIGH voltage, dangerous.No voltage on the ground cable…But you are right, this is not a DIY project.  The OP has already left on vacation…The colder the weather, the better either battery will store and the better your gas will store as well. Use marine grade Stabilizer for ethanol. I would talk to a Toyota dealer about the Prius storage, disconnect the negative on the Camry, pump up the tires and worry more about mice and rodents. If the garage can be kept closed, place some Decon and some  ant traps  about.I was doing research on the military and learned about this statistic. One of the primary researchers for the military and their families, was so invested in her insights regarding military families and reintegration, that I looked her up and found that she herself had returned from deployment,  and was killed in a car crash. Tragic.But I am trying to figure out if it is best to put the car in storage for 6 months or let a younger less experienced generation take responsibility.",,,,
768,1982 GMC S-15 Jimmy - Suggestions on odd parts,Maintenance/Repairs,7,261,"I’m trying to find a 1982 gmc s15 bucket seat tracks both driver and passenger. I’ve looked everywhere I can think of but seeing if anyone else has any ideas on what I can do. The ones that are on now are rusted and falling apart. Th one leg is gone and when I sit down the whole seat moves. Not safe at all. Anyone have any ideas. Tried aftermarket and none are the right dimensions. Either too big for seat and bolts line up or other way around. Please looking for any help. Can anyone find them or am I gonna have to spend a lot of money to get custom made ones. Really don’t want to do that.I’d try https://www.car-part.com/ 1  you may have to buy the complete seatsYeah I’ve tried there and nothing. I can’t even find the complete seats for it. Just the covers or upholstery that’s it.Rusted seat brackets ,  does anyone else suspect there is serious rust all over this truck .There’s not it was just sitting for awhile and it has a convertible top and the top just was leaking and the floor board was rusted out. I’m redoing it and i replaced the floorboard. But the seat brackets were rusted to hell so I had to cut them off and now I can’t find any replacements. Or aftermarket part or even any other vehicle that has the same bolt pattern as this.Spoke, if you can replace floorboards, you can drill a new bolt pattern for aftermarket seat tracks. Reinforce the bottom of the floorpan where the new holes go through with an 1/8 or 3/16 plate about 3x3 inches.
It is very unlikely you’ll ever find decent OE tracks for a 38 year old S-10. Heck, I am amazed the convertible top added to this thing survived the elements.Everything i’m finding so far is for aftermarket seats such as corbeauYeah that was my last resort due to a lot of extra work but looks like that’s gonna be the case because anything I try doesn’t work. Thanks mustangman. Keep that in mind. Also yeah we chopped it off in the 90s and it’s a full custom truck. The seals for the top has had to be replaced a few times already but all in all still doing great.",,,,
769,2012 Hyundai Sonata unsolved whine,Maintenance/Repairs,1,94,I took my 2012 Sonata GLS into the dealer for a whining sound that had progressively gotten worse over a couple of months. They ran a diagnostic($130) and advised that I needed a new transmission with no further explanation. So I asked more questions and they only had 2 ideas. One was a bad bearing and the other was the planetary gear pack. Which doesn’t make any since to me because of the type of noise it is. It sounds more like a fluid restriction whine. I did have the transmission flushed but it did not help.Find an independent transmission shop ( not a chain store type ) and get a second opinion .,,,,
770,Cold weather gas smell - 2003 Subaru Forester,Power/Fuel,12,11.5k,"I noticed that As our Vermont weather approaches freezing, I have a strong gas smell when I drive my 03 Forester.  I had a local mechanic, a person I have no experience/reason not to trust, check it last winter.  They all smelled it; ran all kinds of diagnostic “paper” tests to try to find a leak; checked with local Subaru mechanics and couldn’t ID the problem.  The weather got warmer and the problem went away.  It has started again this winter and I am smelling it again.  I have an appt with a local dealer but the talk on the street is that this place cannot always be trusted to not try to scare people into more “service” than is really needed.  The dispatch person in their dept also said “I’ve heard a lot of people say that about Subarus - I think it’s just something that happens with this car.”

 Is it safe for me to be driving (with my 2 year old?) Has anyone encountered this as well?Is this vehicle under warranty? If not, why are you going to a dealer for some expensive diagnosis that isn’t producing any results? Maybe search out a good independent. Are there any recalls on that vehicle? There is always something on this forum about people over filling there fuel tank and loading up thier fuel overflow cannister. Would you be one of those people?Thank for your reply!  No warranty anymore; independent shop we go to couldn’t find source and suggested a faulty gas hose expands and contracts with temp.  We’re not overflowing gas tank - I stop when it stops, this has been ongoing despite how long it’s been since I’ve filled my tank.  We checked on recalls and warnings and nothing came up.
I thought it was curious that the phone call with the local dealer suggested this wasn’t the fist time she’d heard about this…Does this only happen at start-up, or the entire time the car is being operated?
I’ve experienced the strong gas smell in cold temperatures with my Sube as well, but only at start-up.  Once the car is warmed up/at operating temp the smell goes away.  In the absence of any identifiable source, I just chalked it up to a richer fuel/air ratio being used when the car is started in cold weather (of course I have no idea how true this might be…I can come up with all sorts of baseless theories to explain away things I don’t understand).
I had also heard about the fuel line issue…essentially the fuel lines contract in cold weather, resulting in leakage, but was told that this issue had been addressed with my model year (06).
You could check out www.ultimatesubaru.org 101 for info specific to your car.This past Friday, with the temperatures here in Pittsburgh dipping into the ngetative numbers, I smelled the distinct odor of gasoline in my 2003 Subaru Forester as I sat at a red light.  This had never happened before.  I called the Subaru service department and was told that they had received about 10 calls that day about this same issue.  He indicated that the cold weather caused the lines to contract and allow gasoline to leak onto the engine.  He said that the as the weather warmed up, the lines would expand again, thus minimizing the problem.  However, he said that the only way to correct the problem was to have the lines changed.  When I asked if it was a hazard to continue driving the vehicle until I could have the lines replaced, he suggested that I limit my driving since gasoline dripping onto a hot engine was dangerous.The idea is cold weather causes rubber lines to contract and leak,some things come to mind,why only with Subaru? is the leaking fuel visible? everyone knows cold equals contraction but why is this contraction accompained with leakage,why did Subaru not select a material that does not exibit this condition?
Really what comes to mind is, why is there not a recall related to this situation? it is a definite safety hazard.
Even with VW AFC fuel injection (one of the first) I didn’t see cold cause this and the fuel hose used on these cars leaked with the slightest stress put on it(very easily degraded by heat or just time)surely on a quality  modern car such as Subaru they didn’t scrimp on fuel line quality. Obviously something is going on but a better explaniation than cold=leakage would be nice.This issue should be resolved at Subaru’s expense.Subaru has skirted around getting this fixed on early 2000’s where it is prevelant. I believe the amount of fuel leaked is negligible and a bit of gas is leaking. Maybe every Subaru owner should complain to NHSTA and get something going and reimbursement for back repairs.
I know Subaru WRX owners for 2002 only (they fixed in 2003-present) had this very problem. It was around a $600+ repair and was due to the routing of fuel lines near heat. Subaru was covering it for a while but now that has passed.As temperatures drop to near freezing fuel leaks at the injectors often become evident on some cars. Replacing the O-ring seals at the injectors has corrected the problem. It is necessary to cold start an engine and closely watch the fuel rail and injectors for evidence of leaks before engine heat evaporates the fuel, leaving only the vapor and its odor. Once fully warmed up, the leaks stop. Many of the leaks that have been found here could be so minor as to be ignored but I don’t make that call…I posted before and did not know the exact answer.  I found my bill for repairs.  My subaru guys know what they are doing, not to say that they are cheap.  However, with the gas smell problem on my 01 Outback, they fixed it by: “Replaced fuel rails with new clamps”  Cost $398.78  It workedGreetings,
I have the same problem on my 03 Forester…I did what someone suggested below and wrote NHSTA a complaint and copied all of the below posts into my complaint.  Thanks for all of your input to help out.
NealI’m experiencing the exact same gasoline smell in the bitter cold of this winter, 2018, in my 2004 Forrester. Thanks for the previous advice. I’ll check hoses and write complaintsSame problem here on my 2003 Sub Outback! Only happens when the outside temperature dips below 25. It doesn’t matter how long the engine has run, in fact, the overwhelming gas smell seems to get worse the longer I drive! Very aggravating!!
I’ve found it occasionally helps to turn on the cabin recirculation button on the heater. This doesn’t always work, though…The smell is more than annoying it’s dangerous. I suggest you find a good independent mechanic who has a great deal of Subaru experience and have the situation looked into.",,,,
771,2010 Toyota Matrix - Blue and white smoke,Maintenance/Repairs,2,164,"blowing  bluish white smoke and increases when accelerating on flat and uphillSorry to hear that.
I’d guess your engine is on it’s way out. It’s burning oil, at the very least.Check your oil and coolant levels often and top up if needed. An engine can last a long time even if it’s burning oil.
If you are losing coolant, that’s more serious and needs to be fixed, to prevent rapid catastrophic damage from overheating.",,,,
772,"Thumping/Grinding Noise on Left Bends, Loud Road Noise",Maintenance/Repairs,1,112,"I drive a Kia Optima Hybrid 2013. In the last year, I hit a turkey in flight, where it hit the grill and rolled under the car down the middle (didn’t hit any wheels). The extent of the repairs was a replacement of the hybrid radiator (the radiator under the main one). Also, the frame on the front that holds the radiator and where the hood latches was replaced. The bumper cracked and all of the tabs on it broke, but I reconnected it with zip ties and now it’s secure.
A few weeks later, I ran over a raccoon. It hit the bumper and went under the front left wheel. The fender liner cracked into pieces and was replaced. From what I could tell, that was the extent of the damage.
Flash forward a few months and I rotated the tires. In the next few weeks, I noticed the car started making a noise on left-hand turns. It doesn’t make the noise at low speeds or on sharp turns, but more of left-hand bends. Especially, it makes the noise on left-hand bends when I’m going downhill and/or a little too fast for the turn (around 45 mph). Sometimes, I hear the noise when I’m going straight down hills as well, but not as loud. The noise sounds like a combination of thumping/grinding (metal on metal). It sounds like it’s coming from the front, and, from what I can tell, the front right (but I’m not sure about that).
A little bit later I noticed that the car seems to have a constant noise, similar to the sound of loud road noise. It sounds exactly like driving on a milled road, but a little quieter. It makes this noise most loudly around 35-45 mph and 65-80mph. At the other speeds it can be heard, but it’s not quite that loud. Along with the noise, I can feel a vibration in the gas pedal, and a passenger told me he could feel it in the floor. Wondering if it was bearings, I swerved the car. Swerving left reduces the noise and swerving right increases the noise.
I can’t tell what the issue is, if it’s in the wheel/bearing/CV joint etc. Perhaps, there is more than one issue? Perhaps they are related to tire rotation? Perhaps related to the turkey incident?
Both noises persist (the thumping and the vibration noise described in paragraphs 3-4). Any help would be appreciated.Diagnosing based purely on noise is not nearly as good as also checking the parts you think are failing…

Swap tires front to rear. If it follows the tires, you have a tire problem.

773,2010 Nissan Murano - Wipers come on for no reason,Maintenance/Repairs,2,117,"For years I’ve complained to Nissan that all of a sudden when I turn the steering wheel the windshield wipers go on.

Now without any warning, I park the car, turn the engine off and then the car won’t start, I can’t push the brake in like you normally do when you push the start button but when I push the button I hear a rat-a-tat-tat noise, lights go on but engine won’t start.  Does not sound like it does when the battery dies.  Took it to Nissan, they say the battery is just fine.  They are clueless.  Last night I went to pick someone up; parked the car; turned the engine off; then put it in position to listen to the music for 5 minutes.  Went to start the car, engine wouldn’t start but every darn electrical item turned on - windshield wipers, (which weren’t on at all yesterday), lights, radio (which was on as I said.  Someone had jumper cables and the car started immediately.  Got up this morning and it started normally.  Nissan insists “it could be anything”.  A friend says it may be the alternator, Nissan says no.

774,2015 Subaru XV Crosstrek - Fan Problems,Maintenance/Repairs,2,119,"Fan has been acting up lately, so I wanted to see if anyone could help me out and figure out what’s wrong with it. Recently the fan started not blowing at all if I have it set on 2. 1, 3, and 4 have been working fine. I’ve also noticed if I have it set on 3 or 4, sometimes it’ll blow a lot more than normal for a bit. Yesterday morning, fan wouldn’t blow at all. Tried it again after work, and it was back to blowing normal on 1, 3, and 4.
Any guesses as to what might be causing this issue and if I could possibly fix it myself? Thanks!You have described classic symptoms of a bad blower motor resistor.
If you are reasonably handy, this is likely to be a repair that you can do.The next time the fan stops blowing, with the fan speed set to high, reach under the passenger side dash and with the handle of a screwdriver, rap on the blower motor.
If the blower starts working, replace the blower motor.

775,Possible Ignition Problems on 2011 Chevy Avalanche,Maintenance/Repairs,6,238,"I have a 2011 Chevy Avalanche with 163000 miles. Recently it has developed an issue where sometimes if I turn the key to start it, it won’t do anything. If I turn it back to the off position and try again it starts. I have also had a couple of instances where I start it, and then the engine will die but all of the guages still work and it’s like it is in accessory mode. I am assuming that it is an ignition switch that needs replaced but wasn’t sure if there was something else that could be causing it. I have seen on some forums that it could be an alternator issue or a broken ground wire or something like that. Any ideas would be helpful as I know from personal experience that ignition switches can be a pain to replace.Yes it could be the ignition switch, or a ground, or a fuel pump or a long list of things.
Is the check engine light on? If yes, post the codes. If no, read below…
Does it happen often enough to catch it on a scanner while it refuses to crank? If it does, it needs to be scanned to have a hint as to what the PCM is NOT seeing when you try to crank it.  Not sure what tools you have… so help us out.
Are you going to try and fix it yourself? And can you scan the computer system while this happens?I do have a code reader that I can use to check for codes. Normally no the check engine light isn’t on but I keep my code reader with me so the next time it happens I can do what you suggest. It doesn’t happen often but it has started to happen more than what it used to i.e. it started doing it about 8 months ago and did it once. Now it is doing it every couple of weeks. Thanks for the suggestions!You need more than a simple code reader. The truck won’t throw a code unless it can identify a problem. It isn’t throwing a code so it can’t identify a problem. You need the ability to scan the truck… that is different than just pulling codes
OR you need to get a mechanic to scan the truck when this is happening. It will cost you something but without this, you are unlikely to fix the problem.There is a problem with the starter and/or its related circuitry; engine codes have nothing to do with it, if I am reading your post correctly (no sound or movement when you turn the key). The first thing to try is putting the transmission in neutral when this happens. If that works, the problem is in the neutral safety switch.When you try to start the engine and nothing happens it means that power isn’t getting through the ignition switch for some reason. The trouble could be due to a faulty connection clear back to and including the battery connections. Clean the battery connections and make sure they are snug tight, but not not over tight on the battery posts.
When the engine dies while running I would suspect a fuel issue as the most likely cause of the problem but there are a number of other possibilities.Thank you. Didn’t think about the neutral safety switch.",,,,
776,Abandoned car in NY,General Discussion,65,1.7k,"So I have a chance to get ahold of a first generation Ford Bronco that is on a friends property.

JohnI’m not sure how it works in New York,
In Washington it can be done,  But it takes 7 years to get a clear title, during those 7 years the last known legal owner can claim it and get it back.
Best to ask your local vehicle licensing department.Call your state’s DMV and ask them.Sure check with dmv but it needs to be declared abandoned property on your friend’s land.  Now why not do it the quick way and have your friend have it towed and impounded, then buy it at city/county/whatever auction.Ford abandoned for 12 years?  In NY?  Rust bucket, I bet.

Ford abandoned for 12 years? In NY? Rust bucket, I bet. Have you looked at it closely? It could cost many thousands to make right.


Depends on where in NY…some areas are worse then others for rust. But the first generation Bronco’s would rust out very easily anyways. I can’t imagine it’ll be worth spending the money fixing it up.Have you taken a close look at it?  If not, spend some time looking at it first. If it was junk when it was parked, it is still junk, just a whole lot rustier.Your friends do not have the rights to give it to you. It’s on their property and doesn’t belong to them legally. They would first have to get ownership themselves. The process is pretty clear, took less than a minute to google: https://dmv.ny.gov/registration/abandoned-vehicles 16Well thanks for the input, but I didn’t ask about advice on the condition of the Bronco. I know the condition and know what I am capable of doing and not doing with it. Posted a simple question about if there is a legal way take ownership of it.

For the record it’s not a rust bucket and actually in decent shape.


That’s all we needed to know.  This is an open forum, so you’ll get a wide variety of answers.  We’ve dealt with many folks who skip the basics (like, is it worth fixing) and jump to the legal questions.  Those are much better asked of the legal authorities, see @TwinTurbo 's post, above.Texases,
I get it’s an open forum, but the condition and details of the Bronco have nothing to do with the question I asked. I figured maybe somebody on here has dealt with trying to buy an abandoned car in NY that’s why I asked here. If I wanted an opinion on the condition and/or fixing it up I would ask that. In this case I needed to know if it’s possible to take ownership of the car. I know if the town wants to remove it and auction it they can (one way to get it but then have to worry about the price being driven up at auction). Read about a few ways people legally got ownership and wanted to see if anybody here and possible ways of doing so.Clear as mud after reading the NYS instructions.  Clearly there has to be a simpler way of creating a new title for a reconstructed vehicle.  I guess everything is hard in NY though.
50 years ago my BIL had a 1940 Ford in pretty good shape.  Then about 1962 it disappeared and was gone.  I asked him about it a couple years ago and said he thought he knew where it was.  Clearly for 50 years the thing somehow has been able to get plates in Minnesota.You ask a question here and you will get answers to your question plus answers, advice and warnings about all kinds of things you hadn’t asked about and some that you don’t care about or even want to hear about.First, make a VIN search for the actual owner of the vehicle.
Next, send the owner an invoice for reasonable storage charges and include a demand to remove the vehicle if unpaid.
Depending on the situation, a lien may have to be filed.
After that, you may have to go to auction but with a lien attached it won’t go for much.
Yeah, it may be a PITA for Bronco but it makes more sense if it was a Bugatti that some senile guy left in a garage,.I don’t see how the land owner can demand storage fees, there was likely no such agreement to begin with. If the owner can be found why not just ask them to give it up? Why all the shenanigans? They haven’t wanted it for more than a decade, unlikely they are going to suddenly want it. If they do, they’re entitled to remove it.


 TwinTurbo:

If the owner can be found why not just ask them to give it up? Why all the shenanigans? They haven’t wanted it for more than a decade, unlikely they are going to suddenly want it.


I agree that it is unlikely someone would want a non-collectible vehicle which was left abandoned for a year, let alone a decade.  After just two years of sitting, it will often require significant expense to make a vehicle which was running fine prior to sitting roadworthy again.  After 10 years?  Expect it to need major repairs.  And that’s if it was running fine when it was parked.
That being said, I was not aware that the state would provide you with the owner’s contact info.  Here in Arizona, one would apply for either a bonded title (if purchasing the vehicle from someone other than the last registered owner), or an abandoned title (if the vehicle was abandoned on your land).
The way the OP’s situation would work here is that the friend would write up a bill of sale selling the vehicle to him, perhaps for a token amount, then the OP would apply for a bonded title, and the state would send a letter to the last registered owner–at the last registered address.  Of course, if that person has moved, or passed away, then they aren’t going to respond within the necessary timeframe, and after a waiting period, you receive a conditional title and registration.  At this point, you can legally drive the car.  After a certain amount of time has passed, and no one has made any claim against the vehicle, you receive a regular title, and the bond is canceled.Many years ago the DMVs made it impossible for an individual to take possession of an “abandon” vehicle, they want this action to be performed by licensed businesses to control fraud.
A person can charge rent/storage fees but unless it is a licensed business the DMV will not allow you to place a lien on the vehicle.
The first step would be to go through the vehicle to find owner information so the owner can be tracked down. Make a reasonable offer for the title/vehicle, not $100, not $500, this vehicle is worth more than most people believe. Perhaps the owner has pasted away, then you would need to negotiate with the heirs.
People in California are asking $25,000 for very restorable first generation Broncos, up to $75,000 for restored/customized Broncos. A Bronco in New York may not have the same appeal as a California vehicle but we don’t know the condition of this vehicle.


 bcohen2010:

The way the OP’s situation would work here is that the friend would write up a bill of sale selling the vehicle to him,


He’s not the legal owner of record so he can’t legally sell the vehicle. The landowner has to either contact the vehicle owner or follow local laws to establish ownership of abandoned property.

777,"2014 Jeep Wrangler, Dire sound after starting Tap/Knock/Rattle goes away",Maintenance/Repairs,8,258,"Thanks in advance anyone for their time. I’ve explored every corner of the internet trying to find the same noise.
Upon starting the engine there is a loud tapping, doesn’t sound like a deep knock or rhythmic lifter ticking. It started off very minor, and has slowly gotten much worse. It is loud enough to be heard by anyone in the immediate area, maybe a couple hundred feet.
In every instance so far, it diminishes until gone when all warmed up and the Jeep drives absolutely fine, as good as new in fact. nice and quiet. It is throwing no codes. There are no odors or smoke. I have eliminated the possibility of anti drain back valve, oil filter issue. The oil is fresh and sea foam was added.
One mechanic watched the below youtube videos and says the fact that it’s not rhythmic in time with the engine throws him off. Perhaps someone here can recognize what is going on?
When I turn the key with the gas pedal pressed down to prevent the engine starting the noise is present.
I’ve spent a few days trying to learn online all the various noises and causes, and come up pretty empty. If I had to pick one thing I believe it could be, It’s a loose timing chain banging on its cover and as the engine warms and oil pressure increases the tensioner is finally able to reel her in. But cant get anyone to say yep that’s likely it.
Editing just to add, not coming from the cats, which are bolted directly to block, unless the sound somehow travels or radiates from the rear to the front area of the engine.
First video, right after starting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p45DOBOBLg 7
Second video, after running a minute or two and calming down: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvQs0mhRWcQ 5That is a lot of text with no information  about your vehicle at all. We know it is a 14 Jeep Wrangler but nothing else. Please post mileage, engine type, trans type and how long this has been going on.
Also tell us… has it been to a shop to diagnose the problem? Not just sending a video to a mechanic…if I can’t listen with my ears, and touch it with my hands, I can’t tell the location.
Also, what would you do if I told you what it was? Go tell, a mechanic to fix what I said? Or try and fix it yourself? That is important because “hands-on the Jeep” beats a guy on the interwebs all day long.Ok, I am new to the site. I thought I had entered everything in drop down about what the vehicle is. In my research I kept ending up on this site, so I deliberately entered more information than every post I came across here about the noise, what I have tried and what I have noticed, as most posts are back and forths extracting this information, and none of them contained video or audio at first. I have not been to a shop yet. Every Jeep JK of this era has the 3.6L Pentastar. With any information learned here yes I would perhaps try and fix myself, or at least learn where to start and if anyone else has experienced the same and what it ended up being, i’ll take the challenge and discuss with others who enjoy the challenge before just rolling over and paying whatever it takes without taking a stab myself. 141k miles, auto transmissionThe noise is seriously weird. I have never heard anything like it. A wild guess would be a broken flywheel… Not an easy DIY.
It is impossible to determine where it is coming from listening to a video. You might be money ahead to take it to a shop so they can hear and feel it. Anything making that much noise should light off some vibrations.You need a stethoscope or something to determine where the sound is coming from.  I had what sounded like valve chatter after start up on cold days, ended up being a bad tensioner.Definitely an odd one and does not quite sound like a timing chain to me. Have you considered removing the serpentine belt and starting it up for a few minutes with all accessories inoperative to see if the noise goes away?
This will not hurt a thing and I was just pondering maybe an A/C compressor clutch in the beginning stages of failure or worst case a harmonic balancer failure.Someone at allpar.com may be able to help. They specialize in Chrysler products. I’ve found help on their minivan forum. You’ll find Jeep forums there, too.
That’s the first place I ever heard of a cracked flex plate, which bears investigation. Good luck!Thank you that’s a good idea, will definitely try that. Took about 10 minutes to calm down today and then its just absolutely fine.Yes I must do this, I have a mechanic with the right listening tools going to look on Monday. I also heard of the one where you stick a narrow enough hose down into where the dipstick goes and if its in the chamber there it will be obvious, and loud in the hose.",,,,
778,Please Help! 98 Chevy intermittent stalling mystery,Maintenance/Repairs,15,7.8k,"Hi all- I have a 98 Chevy C2500 pickup (5.7L Vortec 350) that I am having a real frustrating time with. A few weeks ago, I noticed that very occasionally, after the vehicle was warm, I would see a sudden full RPM dip to 0 while driving down the highway, but then the vehicle would return to normal operation. It would happen quickly and would not be any sort of aggressive sputtering.
Then it got to the point where I would have been driving my 10 minute commute on the highway, and then when I took an exit and started driving at 20 mph or so, the truck would completely die, or stall, not sure which one to call it. I would have dash lights, but I would have to quickly shift to N and turn the key off and on and it will fire right back up.
It doesn’t sputter then stall, it just dies and then starts right back up. A few times though it was a bit hard to start it back up. I’ve read that could indicate a failing fuel pump. I can hear the pump loud and clear though so I know it is working at least most of the time.
It seems to idle very low, and my oil pressure also gets down to around 10 psi at idle when the engine is really warm.
It rarely will die at idle, it seems to mostly happen when driving at around 20 mph.
I will stress that it really doesn’t stall DURING acceleration, but instead AFTER I have accelerated and then slowed back down.
I have changed spark plugs and wires, cleaned throttle body and MAF, and cleaned the IAC valve. I also replaced the fuel filter.
I have read stalling problems with these engines could be EGR related, TPS, IAC, ICM, etc.
The truck is in a shop now, and they called me today and said they drove it for a long time, probably 30 miles or so on the highway, and they could not get it to stall. They say it ran perfect. This is just an annoying coincidence- the other night it ran good for me and didnt stall, but It has stalled on me almost every day multiple times in the last week. I told them I will come in and drive it with someone and hopefully get it to stall so they can see.
Anyways, does anyone have an idea what could be causing such an incredibly intermittent stalling issue like this? It doesn’t seem to be fuel, because it doesn’t sputter before or after it stalls. Should I just start replacing easy parts like the ICM and TPS myself? Could it still be my fuel pump? What could be getting hot and working differently than when cold? Could it just be my battery is bad? It is a bit old. Could that be distributor cap and rotor? I didn’t replace those yet (just plugs and wires).
Could it be the fuel pump relay gets hot and somehow stops making a connection?
Any help would be greatly appreciated! I don’t have the money right now to chase this problem endlessly with an auto shop…
BenCheck the wiring to the fuel pump. I had a '97 Blazer that stalled and the problem was wore insulation, resulting in intermittent shorting out and stalling.
Not saying for sure this is it, but it’s relatively inexpensive and somewhat simple to check.I really feel for you. That kind of problem is annoying and hard to fix. These trucks are prone to fuel pump failures and that may cause a stall and restart. It might make sense to just change the fuel pump relay, they are cheap.
Failing ignition parts can cause it, too. I think these still only have a DEI distrubutor and no external spark control so it could be the ignition module. Likely cheaper to replace than a fuel pump.
How many miles on it?I would suspect the Crankshaft Position Sensor.
https://www.rockauto.com/en/moreinfo.php?pk=926391&cc=1303401&jsn=455 70
If you see the tach drop to 0 RPM’s and the engine shuts off, it means the tach lost its signal from the crank sensor.
TesterThanks for the reply!
The truck has 108k miles. The ICM will be high on my list.Thanks for the help. Sounds like that would be a really good thing to try first if I start throwing parts at it.
BenThanks for the input. Is checking that wiring a tricky job or no? Where would I start?
BenI thought you said the pump was running?  Therefore not the fuel pump.  You didn’t mention the crank sensor but really, the best you can do is wait for it to get worse.  Shutting off momentarily and back on again when you flip the switch, certainly does indicate some kind of an electrical issue.  Check all grounds and connections.  Fuse connections, especially for the computer.  Computer connections, and so on as a start.  I suppose coming off of highway speed to slower speed could be a dirty throttle body or IAC but don’t think that would cause your other symptoms. so you could have two different issues.
Do general maintenance then wait for it to get worse is my advice.  I spent months trying to find the cause of stalling and finally gave up.  I could fill the rest of the page with everything I did including the ignition switch.  I’d take it out at night with a fuel pressure tester taped to the windshield and a test light on the fuel pump circuit, and after 7 miles it would stall.  No codes, etc. and start right up.  Even had the wires all changed from the pump to the computer and just gave up, but good luck.Hey thanks so much for the reply. I guess it is just an unfortunate situation. Its too bad that it has started to feel so dangerous to drive (losing power steering and braking while in traffic) or I would have less of a problem driving it till it got worse… Oh well! I will check my connections and maybe throw a couple hundred bucks in small parts at it to begin with. Thanks again.Unfortunately, I didn’t find it so I can’t tell you how difficult it would be to find. I had my mechanic look into the problem, he saw a spark, and was able to easily see the worn insulation. The spark helped focus the search. It was on an exposed portion of the wiring that was touching another piece in the engine compartment that vibrated. I guess 20 years of the minute amount of rubbing simply wore the insulation off.
If it was me looking for such a thing, I would open the hood with the engine off and note where wiring is not protected by any covering or harness or that might have greater exposure to heat. I would then turn on the engine and note what portions may be subject to rubbing or vibration; if you have lived a good and pure life, you may get lucky and see a spark! I’d then turn off the engine and inspect the wiring in those locations. If it has been sparking, you may see discolored/burnt spots. I’d also try to get a wiring diagram, find the wiring for the possible causes and inspect the individual wires.
If you don’t find anything, at least you have done your best to find a simple and less expensive cause. I know I’d feel lousy if I threw a couple hundred dollars of parts at a fix only to find that it was something I could have found had I inspected it.Sometimes you can even HEAR the spark, as it escapes past the bad insulation and finds a path to ground
Kind of sounds like somebody clicking a ball point pen
It also helps if it’s dark outside.  Sometimes that makes it easier to see misfires due to bad plug wiresHave you checked fuel pressure?  A weak fuel pump can run, but not deliver optimal fuel pressure.  I wouldn’t replace a fuel pump without checking pressure first.
Along those lines, when was the fuel filter last replaced?My guess is the same as Mustang’s, faulty ignition module. But it’s just a guess.  Could be the fuel pump or the crank position sensor among other things.  If you can get it to stall and not start, that would be a good time to check for spark at a spark plug during cranking. If you do that and find the spark is ok but it still won’t start, ask your shop if they can fix you up with a fuel pressure gauge located where you can see it as you drive.  Next time this happens look at the gauge. If it is registering close to zero, you know you have a fuel pressure problem. That doesn’t 100% mean the problem is the pump — the pump won’t work if the ECM thinks the engine isn’t turning – but the guess at that point would still be the pump.When I was trying to figure out my stalling problems, I got a coil with the ignition module from a junk yard for about $25.  Should be no problem getting a used one to try.  That wasn’t it for me but was a cheap try.Hi all- this is way late but I thought I would post the fix- it was the crankshaft pos sensor. For some reason when I checked for codes at autozone (twice) I saw nothing, but once I brought it to a shop they saw it was throwing the CPS code. He put a new one in and problem was solved.Pickup coil under distributor. Mark the firewall with where the rotor points, so you can get as close as possible with the next one. Then pull the distributor out and replace with a known good working one. Problem solved.",,,,

All depending upon the severity  you might try using some fine pumice; or volcanic rock. I think you can even get this at Lowes, Home Depot, etc.There is such a thing as glass polish. It is tedious work, though.Polishing is definitely an option but be prepared to have wavy distortion as a result because it is difficult to get a smooth finish using relatively small surface area pressure consistently applied across the large viewing area. You’ll invest a lot of time trying and if you have glass coverage, might not be worth it. The glass guys can support your position it is dangerous in its current state to get the ins to cover it.I’d call around to glass shops to see if they can help.The best tool for fixing a scratched windshield is a rock.The stuff I used (unsuccessfully) filled in the hole with a transparent goop of the same refractive index.

783,"New driver, blind in one eye: suggestions for vehicles and safety?",Buying/Selling,24,2.1k,"I am one of those few souls in this country who–believe it or not–have NEVER owned an automobile of any kind!  (I took Driver’s Ed in high school, but my father could not afford insurance, so I never did any real driving to speak of.)
Fast forward to 2018.  I am now 65 and retired.  I am blind in my left eye due to a totally detached retina.  My right eye, though, is in good shape, and my eye doctor has assured me that my vision is more sufficient to enable me to drive if I wish to do so.
The problem is that, since it has been so long since I have even tried to drive, I would need (and want!) to take a driving refresher course.  Assuming that I pass the course and get a driver’s license again, since my left eye is basically shut down, what modifications, if any, would I need to drive as safely as possible?
I already know that I wouldn’t be driving all that much–primarily to and from the store (particularly in bad weather!), to church on the weekends, and one or two long-distance trips (circa 200 to 500 miles) each year.
As you might expect, I’m on a fixed income, so I’m certainly not in the market for anything like a Trans Am Firehawk!  Rather, I’d like a cube-shaped model with an automatic transmission.  (Remember the Nash Metropolitan?    Something like that would be my ideal, but of course they’ve been out of production for over 50 years!)  As a result, I’m looking at models such as the Nissan Cube and the Scion xB, both of which are still around, although they’ve both been discontinued.  What would you suggest?  Thanks in advance for your time and advice!First of all since you have never had vehicle insurance that and your age are going to work against you. Take the course first and the driving instructor will give you much better advice after observing you behind the wheel.
I think in your case you might consider what is called a Low speed vehicle for your daily needs if you don’t have to travel highways and rent a vehicle for those trips.You’ve done OK for 65 years without a car, why do you want one now?
I’ll tell you a personal story to put things in perspective. My 62 year old mother decided to get a license after my father passed away. My mom’s left eye was very weak and she had no depth perception at all, so she had similar issues to you. While she successfully learned to drive and got her license, she was a danger to herself and others because she drove so poorly. Many accidents, mostly low speeds. The parents in the neighborhood call ME to have her license taken away because they were scared for their children. In my state it was nearly impossible to take someone’s license for any reason, let alone incompetence as a driver.
Do you really want to be in that situation?I think Volvo has provided good advice.A lot of vehicles these days have lane detection sensors. They are made to assist you in driving. This might be something you might want to get. Many cars well under $30 have this feature.


 Tom_Nichol:

since my left eye is basically shut down, what modifications, if any, would I need to drive as safely as possible?


Most states will require two outside mirrors. The good news is, most cars now come standard with outside mirrors on both sides. You shouldn’t really need anything more than that to account for the blindness in one eye. I’ve been driving like that for 50+ years…


 TwinTurbo:

Most states will require two outside mirrors


Hasn’t that feature been required under federal regulations for a few decades?The Subaru Forester has been top rated by CU for older people, because of ease of entry, and good visibility.  It is also squarish and relatively low priced.
Luckily I bought mine in 2015 before they switched to the common (and difficult to use) touch screen control.
Most new cars have poor visibility in the back, due to style issues.
Parenthetically, the latest issue of Scientific America has an editorial on touch screen controls. Bottom line, it rates them terrible.


 MikeInNH:

Many cars well under $30 have this feature


Mike, I know things in NH tend to be a little cheaper than MA, but that is a bit extreme.


 BillRussell:

Mike, I know things in NH tend to be a little cheaper than MA, but that is a bit extreme.


OOPs…Forgot the K.
$30kWhen I renewed my license last year, they do a peripheral vision check as part of the eye test.  That plus depth perception.  I think in Minnesota it doesn’t disqualify but is a noted on the license and there may be a restriction.  Yeah, you really really need to take a full driver’s training course after getting your permit, then take the test.  Much has changed over the past 50 years with cars and rules of the road.
When I was a teenager though, my first insurance premium was $26.  I paid it, my dad didn’t.  I guess it just depend on how much someone wants to drive or not.A friend of mine lost an eye when he was young. When he was old enough to drive he managed to get his license but it was difficult to do.
It took him a long time to master because it threw his depth perception off along with the peripheral vision issue… I wonder if this is going to be a bigger issue for you due to your age.I agree with MikeInNH. I think it would be ideal for you to have a blind spot monitor, parking distance sensors, and a rear cross-traffic monitor to help make up for your limitations.Yeah technology is going to help but at 65 years old, the main road block will be learning how to drive and getting a license.The 2018 Toyota Yaris and Corolla IM have the pre-collision system, lane departure alert, and automatic high beams. More expensive Toyotas have more sophisticated systems.

I have been near blind in one eye since birth and only had a problem once if FL. They did not want to let me transfer my drivers license, as their interpretation was I was legally blind. They finally relented when I brought up the point that I have FL plates, but if I get pulled over and the officer asks why i still have a ND license I will say because FL will not give me one.
I learned how to live with one eye and figure depth perception differently than others I imagine. Known size and appearance of an object is how it seems to me.
How long have you been with one eye OP, Long enough to feel comfortable with depth perception. Hey if I can do it anyone can and my safety record is not out of norm with most people.
I was required for a few states to have a driver side rear view mirror, as my right eye is the bad one, that seems to have gone away.
I agree with the other posters lane departure alerts and sensors for cars when changing lanes are a good idea for anyone.
A drivers ed class would be an excellent testing ground to see how comfortable you will be with driving.
Best Wishes.

 VDCdriver:

Hasn’t that feature been required under federal regulations for a few decades?


I’m not sure if, or how long, having two outside mirrors as standard equipment has been required by federal regulations but that’s irrelevant. I’m referencing a restriction on your driver’s license issued by the state. If you drive around with one missing, it will be an equipment violation. If I get caught doing the same, I’m in violation of my driver’s license restriction and it won’t end up quite so simple as a fix it ticket…


 Tom_Nichol:

I am blind in my left eye…


Remember that your peripheral vision to the left is half of what it is to the right.  Quickly get used to rotating your head more to the left as you scan the road.I worked with 2 Tractor Trailer driver who were blind in one eye.  They were city drivers so had to back into tight spots and stop without hitting things. They both drove quite well and had long careers. They were cousins who both had a congenital defect in one eye. They had another cousin who took the physicals for all of them because you need good vision in both eyes to pass a DOT physical.  At least in ny state  20/40 in one eye is enough to get a car license.  I have seen longer rear view mirrors with angled ends and suggest you get one.  If money is tight and you want a boxy little car, try out a Kis Soul.
Happy motoring!

Are you saying they fudged, and had the cousin take the physicals, in their stead . . . ?!
Or are you saying the cousin was a doctor and administered the physicals?

784,2015 Volvo XC60 Excessive Oil Consumption - Seeking Practical Advice,Maintenance/Repairs,66,9.3k,"All, first time poster and hoping to find some rationale advice!  I have a 2015.5 Volvo XC60 T6 with the Drive-E engine with close to 65,000 miles.  I received my first Low Oil Warning light around 55,000 miles, added a quart and it went away.  It has happened twice since that time.  The car seems to be using a quart of oil every 5,000 miles.  I had the dealer look it over, they ran their tests (which I’m unsure of “what” they did, ran it up the chain with Volvo and they stated it needed a ring/piston job at the tune of $5,000, of which Volvo is kind enough to offer to pay $500.00 (geez, thanks).
I’ve called four independent Volvo mechanics in the area and they all had a few different opinions, including just add 5 to 6 quarts of oil at each oil change, use a higher viscosity, change the oil more frequently, make sure you monitor the oil levels;  however, no one recommended a full on piston/ring job on a car that’s only 4 years old.  This car does not have a dipstick but has the warning light that will let me know when it’s low.
We like the car, it drives well, we bought it for safety reasons and we will be passing to a child in a few months when they turn 16.
I realize folks will have very different opinions here but I want to make sure I don’t do any long term harm to the car, or, if I should just try to offload this thing ASAP.  I’ll be diligent monitoring the oil light and don’t mind adding oil when needed.  My history with cars is essentially all Toyota’s and I haven’t added oil to a car since I drove an 84 GMC pickup that had leaking seals.  Some of my research says this is no big deal and perfectly normal.  On other Volvo forums people are losing their minds.
All suggestions welcome.
Thanks.I say trade or sell. Do you really expect a 16 year old to stop and add oil when that light comes on . If it were you to be the main driver I would say just keep the oil level where it should be .
If you have a Carmax near you they will give you a price that is good for 7 days .

The car seems to be using a quart of oil every 5,000 miles.


Did you mean to type “5,000 miles”, or did you intend to type “500 miles”?
Even with a brand-new engine, the consumption of 1 qt of oil per 5,000 miles is not only considered to be good, it is actually a fairly low rate of consumption.
How would you feel if you bought a new Audi or Mercedes, both of whose manufacturers state that it is “normal” for their engines to consume 1 qt of oil every 600 miles?VDCdriver, thanks.  The 5,000 is correct and thanks for verifying.  And I couldn’t imaging dropping big dollars on a new Audi or Mercedes with that kind of usage!Thanks Volvo_V70.


 dkrickeltonjr_159512:

On other Volvo forums people are losing their minds.


If they are going berserk over the consumption of 1 qt of oil every 5,000 miles, then I think that they have definitely lost their minds.No dipstick?Just some random advice here but it sounds like you are not raising the hood ever to check the motor oil level. The practice of running the oil low actually contributes to the oil consumption problem as the remaining oil runs hotter which in turn leads to oil coking which in turn leads to stuck oil control rings.
A quart every 5k miles is not bad at all but you really need to keep the oil topped off or the problem is going to get much worse and it may come on suddenly also.Thanks.  I would love to raise the hood and check the oil, but this particular engine does not have a dipstick but rather an electronic oil sensor.  I have to rely on that reading to determine level.


 dkrickeltonjr_159512:

I have to rely on that reading to determine level.


By your statement are you waiting for the low level warning to alert you ? It appears that you are not using the system to check the level on a regular basis . At least show this child how to do that each time of the first vehicle usage  of the day . I would say once a week but young people will forget to do that . It only takes a few seconds .I believe since the Volvo has no dipstick, the light comes on when it is time to add a quart of oil, not when the engine is so low on oil that it starts losing pressure.  5000 miles per quart is far above any manufacturers standard for needing repair. My Toyota manual claims that i quart per 600moles is not excessive.  If it bothers you to add a quart of oil, just get it changed every 5000.A quart in 5000 miles is very minimal oil consumption and you should be changing the oil at 5,000 miles or so anyway. If you’ve added two quarts at 5,000 mile intervals it sounds like you’ve gone 15,000 miles without changing your oil. That’s not a way to prevent oil consumption.One quart every 5k miles is nothing to worry about in my book. It is unfortunate there is no dipstick, I would not loose too much sleep over it. My big question would be how low is it when the warning kicks in. If it comes on when you are at 2 quarts instead of 5 and you add one quart that is not good. Best idea I can think of is get an oil change when the light kicks on and see how much drains out.I believe going from Toyota’s to an out of warranty Volvo is going to be an experience. Sell now.Is this an early April Fool’s joke?  I don’t think I have ever had a car that used such little oil as to be able to go 5000 miles and only needing to add one quart.  In fact, even an oil consumption of one quart every 1000 miles would be considered acceptable by most manufacturers on a new engine!

Is this an early April Fool’s joke?


+1
But, whether it is a prank or not, for somebody to say something along the lines of…
I never before had a car that used a qt of oil every 5k miles… and to assume that this indicated a problem with their present car is just not being realistic.
That type of “reasoning” reminds me of parents who would say to me… How can my kid have failed Algebra?  He never failed anything before, so there must be something wrong with the teacher!Thanks.  I had the full service done at 60,000 miles and have done oil changes at 5,000 to 7,500 intervals since I’ve had the car (about 18 months).  I’ve put close to 19,000 miles on the car in a year with work and Ubering kids around.  When given to the first child, I bet it won’t be driven 10,000 miles a year.


 dkrickeltonjr_159512:

I bet it won’t be driven 10,000 miles a year


Which means it will be nearly 2 quarts low on oil and which may destroy the engine if you don’t teach your kids to check the oil level more often than you do.


 VDCdriver:

Even with a brand-new engine, the consumption of 1 qt of oil per 5,000 miles is not only considered to be good, it is actually a fairly low rate of consumption.


While manufacturers do say that…I’ve NEVER EVER owned a vehicle that used more then 1/2 pint every 5k miles…Even when said vehicle had over 300k miles. My 14 Highlander only has 125k miles…and before I change the oil (every 5k miles)…the mark is right at the same level it was when I changed it.

786,"Cadillac ATS shifting on its own, help!",Maintenance/Repairs,8,266,"Hoping someone here can help me. I have a 2014 ATS, about 50K miles. Sometimes while I’m driving, the car will go from Drive to M1 or M2 gear without me doing anything. There are no shift buttons on the wheel, and I definitely didn’t shift gears myself. If I try to shift the gears to get it back in drive nothing happens. Reverse neutral and park all work, but the screen will still show M1/2. Turning the car off and back on will bring it back to normal sometimes, but there have been times I’ve just had to wait for a few minutes before I could drive normally again.
The dealership said no codes came up when they ran it for that
Any idea what can cause this??? The car is currently at the dealership, and of course this didn’t happen when they checked it out so they’re saying it’s fine.
I don’t know much about car maintenance but someone suggested it may be a PCM issue?
any advice would be appreciated. I’m supposed to pick the car up tomorrow but I want to be sure they checked everything that could possibly cause this before I pay them for essentially renting a loaner car for a day. Thanks in advanceSounds like a PCM problem but it could be something else. Wiring, or a bad button or… lots of things.
Problem is… WE can’t lay hands on the car, scan the PCM while this is going on, or experience the problem. The dealer can.
That is the only way this problem is going to be fixed. And the tech better be pretty good at diagnosis or the rental car is going to be pennies compared to the parts that could be thrown at this problem trying to fix it.
I wish you the best of luck. Post back with what the dealer finds and tell us what they did.The dealer looked at it and they said they didn’t find anything wrong. The car ran fine when they drove it of course, that’s why I came on here for advice, maybe one of you guys would suggest something they didn’t check.
Obviously this isn’t something I can’t ignore, and them saying they found nothing wrong is just unacceptable.
Thank you for your reply, I don’t know anything about cars besides how to drive them so I appreciate the help! I’ll post back here after I see them tomorrow…Just picked the car up, they said they couldn’t find anything wrong. I drive the car to Wendy’s, while I’m waiting in line I notice the car had moved to M2 mode so I took a video of me attempting to change gear and sent it to them, hopefully this will help get me an answer.Lemme ask you… The screen changes to M2 mode, but does the car drive any different? Shift funny? Not shift at all? Or is it just the display that changes on its own?
BTW, the advice you got on the Cadillac Forum regarding the center console shifter replacement sounds like a real possibility.The speed drops a little bit, and when you hit the gas it’s a loud revving sound(not sure if that’s the right word But best description I can come up with) I’ve always pulled over and waited for it to go back to normal when that happens, doesn’t seem like driving that way is good for the car.
I have to get my brakes done soon so I’ll have him look at the shifter while he has the car in there.I don’t have an answer, but I do have a question-what is M1 and M2?  Are they first and second gear in manual mode?Sounds like when it SAYS M1 or M2, it really IS in first or second gear.
I suggested a scan because with no error code, you could at least see what command the transmission is actually being given irrespective of the gear shift lever setting. Makes me think the gear lever switch is bad. If the shifter really is $114 as the Caddy Forum says, I’d say that’s the cause and replacing it is the (cheap) fix.Hopefully it’s the gear switch, I can live with that price! I’ll post back here next week after my regular mechanic checks it out while he’s changing my brakes.",,,,

I have a squeaking sound that appears to be coming from this part. Can someone help me identify what this part is? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!That appears to be the hydraulic control unit for the ABS.
Is the ABS warning light lit up?That looks to be it! No, the ABS light is not on in the car. Is there any component in this that might squeal?Is the noise constant? When does it make the noise?The noise is mainly when turning on the car for the first time. It seems to go away after driving for a bit.Did you just acquire this vehicle?
I ask because ABS-equipped vehicles go through an automatic ABS self-test when they are driven after being shut-off for many hours.
This varies considerably from one make or model to another, but on some models, that ABS self-test can be fairly noisy.  Typically, the noise is heard after driving… maybe… 20 or 30 feet,  and will not be heard again until the next “cold start”.good guess from @VDCdriver, but I would suspect something more simple, like a worn serpentine belt in need of replacementI agree, that part is near the belt drive area on the passenger side (it’s far away from the brake master cylinder).We bought it about 6 months ago, but recently had to change the battery and alternator. Not sure if this could have reset something? I took it out today for a drive and the sound seems to come back every time I accelerate. It isn’t overly loud, but the sound is still there. Does that help?It could be an idler for the belt that drives the alternator, or your new alternator could have noisy bearings.  Did the noise start when you had the alternator replaced?The ABS self test occurs at low speed just after starting to move forward for the first time. My 2005 Accord did it,  it only first thing in the morning. I backed about 75 feet to the street, put it in drive, and by the time I hit about 10 mph, the test ran. I don’t notice it on my 2017 Accord or my wife’s 2019 Odyssey.


 cmil14:

Then it isn’t the ABS self-test that you are hearing.
Both of the suggestions below are worth pursuing, as I think that they are the most likely.

For the same cost as one of these two really bad new cars, a wise consumer could buy a US-made vehicle that is ~ 3years old, and that would be far more reliable, and would have better driving dynamics.
That being said, I knew a woman who bought a Yugo, and after she dumped it, her best defense of it was… Well, it wasn’t THAT bad!
I never asked her to quantify the Yugo’s “badness”.Never drove one.  In my day it was the Fiat, like the 500.  The boss had one painted purple for delivering chicken.  It wasn’t THAT bad.  A friend of his had the junk yard down the road which is probably where it came from.It was a 70s Fiat design originally meant for local productions.There was a popular joke in the Yugo era.

It’s what he could afford.the 1st one seems to be a “high line” Yugo . . . because it has alloy rims and what looks to be additional lighting, maybe fog lamps? between the tail lamps and the license plate lamps
What a waste of alloy rims

Was that Malcolm Bricklin . . . ?It’s better described in the book but the whole book covers the history of Zastava, the Yugo itself, and the various cars that Malcom Bricklin brought to market.
Basically Bricklin wasn’t the first one to try to import the Yugo but he took the credit.


 wolyrobb:

Basically Bricklin wasn’t the first one to try to import the Yugo but he took the credit.


That because he was “successful” in importing it, unlike the first entity that attempted to do so.   When the Yugo was first subjected to emissions testing in The US, it led to a fairly long delay before the manufacturer could figure out how to clean-up the emissions.  During that delay, the first importer bailed, and Bricklin jumped onboard.


 db4690:

Was that Malcolm Bricklin . . . ?


Yep. Was also responsible for Subaru being here - at least that one worked out, unlike Yugo and the SV-1. Sometimes YoGo…sometimes YoDon’t.
Gas-Monkey-Garage sold one once…for a lot more then what they originally sold for. Seems people collect them. There was a YuGo dealer in Hudson NH that lasted for about 4 months.
I can’t really complain too much about them…I use to own a Vega. At least the Vega is no longer considered the worse car sold in the US thanks to YuGo.How 'bout this one?

1986 Yugo with Two Cadillac V8s – Engine Swap Depot 8





That man is warped. I hope he keeps up the good work.I love the Cadillac powered Yugo, but disagree with the engine weight part of that story unless I’m just flat missing something. Cadillac 500 engines do not weigh 1500 to 1600 pounds each. They’re only mildly heavier than a small block Chevy and claimed weight on a complete engine top to bottom with everything in place is roughly 675 pounds.
A 4100 pound car with a claimed engine weight of at or over a ton and a half? Something missing or I can’t seen the forest for the trees.


 ok4450:

Cadillac 500 engines do not weigh 1500 to 1600 pounds each.


The author of that article probably confused the total weight of engines plus transmissions with the weight of each.
Even a Caddy with one 1500 lb engine under the hood would be hopelessly nose heavy.
David Letterman’s top 10 list of things that were good about the Yugo included, ‘At least no one will steal it.’
An American ambassador to Yugoslavia got a lot of good feelings there by driving one.Was the SV-1 the particularly hideous looking “safety vehicle” . . . ?!

794,2020 Honda Accord Sdn - The first 52 miles were perfect. Then,Maintenance/Repairs,55,2.1k,"Just bought a 2020 Honda accord sport off the show room floor with 52 miles. Once I drove it off the lot got a half a mile when the check engine light came on  it became hard to drive, all the different messages came on had to drive it back to the dealership and was told service is closed and they said it was the battery. any advise will be helpful. The car started fine and the lights stayed bright. do you think it was the battery or is it a computer problem?Does not matter what I think or anyone else . You have a warranty so just let them solve this.  If they can’t solve it after several tries then you need to find the corporate contact number in your owners manual .  Also research your state Lemon Law .As Volvo says, it doesn’t matter what’s wrong. A new car with 52 miles shouldn’t break down.I would agree with the others.  It’s Honda’s problem.  I hope the dealer provided transportation for you.
I doubt that any diagnosis made when you took the vehicle back is valid.  The service department was closed, so a mechanic didn’t look at it.Friend got new accord 10yrs ago in town 100 miles from home. Drove 50 miles and motor overheated. Maybe it was 40 miles? Thermostat was to blame. Had it towed back to dealer. Update. Blew head gasket too. Fixed it. Had it 3 yrs, no other issues.After concluding a deal on a car, we have usually had to stick around for an hour or so while the final prep is done.  Gotta believe that would include the battery condition but a thermostat would be unusual.With 52 miles on this vehicle I suspect that you are not the first buyer of this vehicle to be disappointed, someone else may have experienced the same problem and unwound the deal. Vehicles parked in the showroom don’t accumulate miles from road tests.
I doubt recharging the battery will solve the problem.As was already stated, this is Honda’s problem, not the OP’s problem, and the OP should not be trying to diagnose this himself/herself or have anyone other than the dealership perform the diagnosis.   In case the OP doesn’t understand why I made that statement, if he/she tells the dealership to replace “X”, and if that repair doesn’t work, then the cost of that repair will be completely on his/her shoulders.

Demand (politely) a free loaner car while they diagnose/fix the problem.
Allow them to diagnose and fix the problem, rather than offering a diagnosis/fix.
If the dealership is unable to resolve the problem to your satisfaction, contact Honda of America.  Contact info can be found in your Owner’s Manual.
In the meantime, start researching the details of the Lemon Law for your particular state.
Be sure to retain all documentation of their repair attempts, because you will need this evidence if you have to go forward with a Lemon Law complaint.

Sincere good luck with the problem!With 52 miles on it that means someone else’s fingerprints have been on it; either a buy back from a customer or a dealer demonstrator. I’m a bit surprised to see that with 52 miles it was even placed back on the showroom floor.And whatever you do, get everything in writing, including this first trip back to the dealer.  You want to be able to document things if this turns into a lemon law case.A buyback is a used car. They can’t sell it as new. If they do, that creates other problems for the dealer. If the dealer put tags on it, this implies it was registered.Before this gets too far afield, I suspect what he/she/it was talking about was that he drove it for 52 miles and then the problem, not that it had 52 miles in the show room.  Otherwise it doesn’t make sense if it already had 50 miles and he drove it awhile and developed the problem.

He/she apparently got half a mile and the car started acting up. He/she returned to the dealership but the service dept. was already closed. Someone, maybe a sales guy trying to be helpful, suggested it might be the battery.


 davepsinbox_157004:

OK, I’ll rescind my comment.It is possible most of the 52 miles racked up were from driving the car from one dealership to another. Nothing nefarious about that.

I don’t believe that people come here to ask these questions so they can learn how to repair new cars. They want to understand the weight of the problems that may follow if they choose to keep this new vehicle that can’t make the trip home without failure.

@thegreendrag0n How would you react if your new Honda showed signs of failure within 30 minutes of possession?Unless the guy driving it was related to the guy who drove a new Subaru from the corporate office in San Antonio, TX to the dealer I worked for in OK City. He left a little after 5 in the morning and pulled in at 11 A.M. He did not want to stick around for free lunch and just wanted to get to the airport.
It was discovered the car would barely run, the turbocharger was barbecued and so was a part of the paint on the hood due to turbo heat. The turbo must have been glowing red the entire way.
He covered 467 miles in under 6 hours and that included going through 4 metropolitan areas; one of them Dallas/Fort Worth at morning rush hour.Failures sometimes do occur right away with a new vehicle or any new appliance.  There is a statistical distribution that describes this.  It is called the negative exponential distribution.  The probability of a defect is higher when s car  is  first put into service, but declines exponentially over time until the expected life of the vehicle is up.
I bought a new Toyota 4Runner in 2003.  It had a terrible chirping sound in the engine.  The dealer replaced the belt and two days later, the chirp was back.  The belt was again replaced.  Not only did the chirping noise come back, but the belt was installed improperly and the crankshaft oil seal was pulled out and the vehicle leaked oil.  I took the 4Rinner back.  A new belt was installed and the oil seal replaced.  Two days later, the chirp was back.  This time when I returned to the dealer, I had a copy of the lemon law. I said the dealer could either buy it back or he could give us a loaner and would have one more chance to fix it.  The problem turned out to be a weak spring in the belt tensioner.  We still have the 2003 4Runner and it has been trouble free since that time.
I bought a new refrigerator.  Two days later everything in the freezing compartment melted. Then it refroze everything.  Three days later, it went through the same cycle.  The independent appliance store sent out the repairman who had a great reputation and he had repaired my parents’ appliances years before.  He checked the refrigerator and couldn’t find the problem as it was working perfectly.  Just as he was ready to leave, the refrigerator stopped cooling.  He immediately went to the phone, called.the store and had a new refrigerator sent to my house.
A few years later, we decided to buy a freezer.  I went back to the store where I bought the refrigerator.  They offered me a great price on a freezer that had been returned because the compressor had gone out in the first week.  The technician I trusted had installed a new compressor and the freezer came with a new warranty.  The freezer was trouble free for 35 years until it finally gave out.  By that time, the independent appliance store and repairman were long gone.

Question is did I do potential damage to my car and what should I be on the alert for?Very obviously, you were not in neutral, because a car in neutral won’t move.  It sounds like you were in first gear, and the transmission was not shifting up to second.  Read your owner’s manual about the operation choices you can make as the operator that might have led to the non-shifting.  Also, look carefully to see if the indicator for your gear shift is giving the appearance of being in neutral when it isn’t.  So, the question is…how many different positions of the gear shift will allow the car to move forward…and what is each position used for?  That is why I suggest reading the manual.,and I doubt if you did any damage.  You were just hearing the engine at high RPM, and the engine probably has a mechanism to limit the RPM  to prevent engine damage.Driving in neutral is also known as “coasting.” You might maintain 30mph for 2 miles going downhill but not on level pavement. I’m inclined to more-or-less agree with @oldnotdeadyet that you were probably just in a lower gear than usual. There was likely no harm done. Assuming it’s an automatic, your Mazda 3 has a 4 speed transmission. It could have been in second gear. There could be a problem with the linkage between the shift lever and the transmission. A good independent transmission shop can tell you more.",,,,
797,Exploding passenger side mirror,General Discussion,33,17.8k,"Today my girlfriend and I were driving down a residential street and all of a sudden the passenger side mirror exploded. There were no other cars, motorcycles, no mail boxes or birds. I immediately pulled over and inspected the broken side mirror the mirror was hanging on by the wiring with cracks in the mirror, the cover was laying on the ground, I picked it up and in inspected it, there was no physical damage to the cover at all no pings or dings. Weird! I can’t explain why this happened so I Googled “exploding passenger side mirror” and found this had happened to someone on this forum several years ago.If that happened in the neighborhood I lived in while in grad school I’d be looking for a bullet hole.I’ve heard of this happening once before, on this very forum. I don’t recall the explanation. Perhaps others here with better memories can recall.Tempered glass has internal stresses that can sometimes cause the glass to spontaneously “explode” if it has been nicked, cracked, etc, or has any slight surface defect that allows a crack to start propagating.

I’m going to guess that even if the mirror defroster wasn’t turned on, the mirror may have overheated, due to a defective component.
Is this Infiniti still under warranty?
Even if it isn’t still under warranty, bear in mind that auto manufacturers sometimes have (silent)repair campaigns for gratis repair of problem components, but unless a car owner complains about said item, they are unaware of these silent campaigns.
Even if the dealership gives you the cold shoulder on this problem, a phone call to Infiniti (Nissan) at the corporate level might yield some help, as the more expensive the car, the more likely they are to try to keep customers happy, in the interest of maintaining buyer loyalty.It’s usually that you HIT something . . and . . no . .you insist you didn’t.
Because ?
Your attention is directed is front of you as you’re driving.
So much distance transpires from the point of impact, to the surprise of it happenig , to the point you finally pull over . .
That you still can’t process that you hit something.
But you did.
My 80 Bronco right side door window exploded into the cabin as I was driving.
bullet ?
Thrown rock ?
no.
I hit a parked truck !
Yes, me myself and I. . . surprise !
( the Bronco had tripod bolted mirrors, not swing-lock. Dented the door, broke the door glass as well as the mirror )Was anyone mowing near you? A thrown stone can go pretty far.
Did you leave a cooler garage and start driving on a sunny warm day? If so, the thermal stress idea sounds reasonable.Thermal stress can cause glass to shatter. I’ve heard of drinking glasses just sitting on a shelf shattering.
BUT, I don’t think the forces involved are enough to blast the entire mirror off the car.
And you said the glass had only cracks in it.  Which rules out the shattering glass due to thermal stresses.My wife had an unexplained rear window shatter on her new Olds Cutlass one spring afternoon. I went over to the elementary school the next morning and viewed the security camera footage with the principal. The school paid for the rear window because a riding mower was seen driving in a gravel strip and throwing small gravel everywhere.Years ago I was driving through Europe (Holland) and saw a car with the flashers on by the roadside. I pulled over and saw a woman standing by the side of her car, puzzled. Her windshield had completely cracked into a thousand pieces and you could not see through it. Because of the laminations, it was still intact of course.
She explained it just happened without anything striking it! It was an English car, I forgot which make but  could be a Rootes Group car. We managed to flag down the highway police who got her a tow truck. To this day I’m puzzled as to the exact cause of this, as the weather was normal.Something probably hit it and you missed the sound. Even without traffic, this stuff happens. I was driving home from work through the US Department of Agriculture farm when something hit my windshield. There were no cars in front of me in either direction, and no apparent source by the side of the road. All I could figure is that someone was hunting illegally and a stray bullet glanced off the windshield. Stuff happens.Yeah it happens but who knows why for a particular mirror?  That’s one reason I like to use the mulcher on the riding mower.  There is no grass, rocks, and other debris being thrown out the side.  It’s all kept under the cutting deck.Interesting to have learnt about your experience. I was searching about this strange “phenomenon” in the web for incident like yours which happened to me earlier in the noon. And i’m glad that i’m not alone.
It was a nice weather and was driving at speed of between 40 to 50km/h when suddenly a loud “BANG” happened and intuitively i look into the side where the sound came from. It is where at this point i saw the left wing mirror was badly cracked and it’s hanging in the air with a wire attached to the side wing mirror holder mechanism. It was really bizarre!!
I was suspecting on whether could the mirror exploded prior to my car’s exterior mirror heating function…as i’ve always position it in the heating position.
I have however managed to position the “exploded” mirror back to the wing housing and could only wait till Monday to get to the workshop to get if fix.
I’m driving a Volkswagen Passat B7 - 1.8 tsi. I’m from Singapore. Following is the image of my left exterior side mirror.  This just happened to me yesterday. I’ve never heard of this before until I searched the web. There was absolutely nothing close enough to hit, no vehicles parked at the side of the road, no trash cans, no branches sticking out. Also, it appears that something broke through the cover near the base; If I hit something, there would be damage near the outermost part of the mirror cover, but it is intact. I’m going to report this to my insurance because if it’s a defect, it could be dangerous. If my passenger window was open at the time, I would have been showered with broken glass. It was very loud - as if a firecracker or gunshot went off next to the car.
Has anybody found out anything else about this? 2015 Toyota Camry Hybrid.That is the drivers side, unless you live in the UK?
Glass that is not properly tempered can explode, break into pieces, although this seems a bit more extreme than that. I’ve heard of water glasses sitting on a shelf just explode.
It has to do with internal stresses in the glass setup when the molten glass solidifies. Tempering is supposed to relieve those stresses, but sometimes that is not done correctly.Yeah this has come up here before.  It can happen to mirrors or glass.  Could be heat, internal stresses, the result of maybe being hit before and causing unseen stress that finally gives way, etc.  Yup, kind of startling but a good reason to keep your windows shut.  I used to have mine open some but then a truck threw up a pile of slush that hit me right in the face.This happened with the driver side rear window of my Subaru wagon some years ago. I live in a small town and stopped at the post office to pick up the mail on the way home.
I got back in to the car, closed the driver door, and the rear glass exploded with a bang.Today my side mirror exploded and I was going 10 miles an hour because I was getting ready to stop at a stop sign. I didn’t hit anything. It just exploded and only the mirror was hanging off my car with shattered glass. I took it to the service representative at the dealer and he said he would fix it because it is 1 year old. I then asked if he could have a mechanic look to see what caused the explosion and he said no because there are no component parts on the mirror which has eyesight. I asked if he had asked the mechanic and he said yes. Then he told me the best thing to do was to call my insurance company to have it fixed and then he ran outside to take pictures of the mirror that has no dents that would signify impact. He saw some scratches but nothing to cause serious impact for it to completely shatter.I guess it’s possible that you could have hit a bird, or maybe a stone flew up from the front wheel, but it’s more likely that some form of tension in the molded plastic, or a stress from bumping into the mirror while you are slipping alongside that car in a garage, finally popped in heat or cold.

798,Double Clutch?,General Discussion,14,269,"I know there is no such thing as a dumb question, just dumb people asking questions. I known that the floppy paddles use a double clutch, the question is: when I want to pass on a highway I hit the up paddle and it goes to 7th. I then down shift to 6th and the car takes off. Is this the proper thing to do or is it the cause of the funky smell I have stated to notice?

How do you know this? What model do you own (you don’t say)?



 daveszilagyi:

Don’t do this. If the car is already IN 7th… and if you are on the highway, it is in 7th… hitting the upshift paddle does nothing and hitting the downshift paddle shifts to 6th.
Either let the trans shift on its own or downshift to 6th directly.Describe the funky smell.
Not all flappy-paddle cars use a dual clutch transmission (dual, not double - double clutch is something different). But whether yours has a normal automatic or a DCT, downshifting isn’t going to hurt it because the computer will not let it downshift if doing so would cause damage.
As @Mustangman said, hitting the up-shift paddle is not necessary.If you’re in 6th there’s no reason to shift to 7th and then back to 6th for passing. Just get into the gear that gives you the needed response. Usually 3,000 to 4,000 RPM will give a good launch and shift up at ~ 5,500Your Honda is very smart about shifting on its own, I would only use the paddles in certain circumstances, like when keeping speed under control going down hill.
No Honda has dual clutches, I’m pretty sure.  All are either regular automatics or CVTs (with fake ‘gears’ if they have paddles).Why do you hit the upshift paddle first? You should just be hitting the downshift paddle, possibly even twice.


 texases:

No Honda has dual clutches, I’m pretty sure.


I thought that, too but there are a couple of models that do have DCTs… at least Wikipedia lists them.
Honda does have a DCT for motorcycles and has for 10 years! Surprised me.Hello, to be honest it’s a company car, it’s 2014 and I think the modal is Sport.
When I hit the paddle it says 7. I then I down shift to 6th and the car picks up speed without hitting the gas. When accelerating from a toll both I do he same, I go from 4th down to 3ed and it picks up speed and then I work up to 5th or 6th.
The problem I find is you are never sure what gear you are in. I could be doing 50 and hit the paddle and it tells me it’s in 7th and that does not seem right. Should I stop trying to have fun with it like I do a on speed stick and just leave it in automatic?
Thanks for your reply.
Thanks,

“If you’re not making mistakes, then you’re not doing anything. I’m positive that a doer makes mistakes.” - John Wooden@daveszilagyi  I am going to give the same answer that I gave to your July thread about using the paddle shifters to slow down on off ramps .
Just put the silly vehicle in drive and let the transmission do what it was designed to do.  The transmission will down shift at the proper time and do it without your help.Yes, stop shifting it. The transmission knows what gear it needs.
And there is no such model as “Sport”… there is a prefix.


 daveszilagyi:

Hello, to be honest it’s a company car, it’s 2014 and I think the modal is Sport.


Stop abusing your company vehicle and maybe you need to find out what you are actually driving and read the manual .

I’m wondering if you are upshifting too soon, bogging the engine down in a higher gear, then when you drop it down to where the optimum range is, the car accelerates as it should.   if this is the case, then the loose nut behind the wheel is the issue.  


 VOLVO-V70:

Stop abusing your company vehicle


I don’t really consider downshifting with the paddles to be abusing the vehicle.I’m guessing this is the Accord ‘Sport’ trim.  I don’t think it has a dual clutch, it’s the Acura ILX and TLX that might have it, as far as I can tell.  An 8 speed DCT with a torque converter, to smooth out the low-speed shifts.
It sure is complicated:

799,Fill-up and Fuel Pump Failure,Maintenance/Repairs,12,261,"I stopped for gas with my 2005 Buick Century and after I filled it up, the engine stalled and shut off after a few seconds. I tried to restart it a few times and had the same symptoms. Luckily, my mechanic was right next door to the gas station and I caught him before he left. He immediately diagnosed the problem. He said GM fuel pump failures is a common problem right after a fill up. Could the problem be caused by a station attendant trying to force more gasoline into the tank for an even dollar amount? (self serve is not legal in my state).No, overfilling doesn’t fail pumps. It is 15 years old, the pump is due for replacement.


 jmcarc:

Seriously ?  Then why don’t I see a lot of GM vehicles setting at the fuel pumps waiting on a tow truck ?I’d suspect water contamination first but if he diagnosed the pump is not pumping, then that is definitive.It is a clear example of Murphy’s Law… internal tank pumps always fail when the tank is full, never when empty.I think the fuel pump is off more then it runs.Maybe the oil companies had a hand in designing the fuel pumps.


 jmcarc:

I can assure you they didn’t.
I used to work for the company that designed and built your fuel pump. Oil companies couldn’t screw it up that badly! A government could…  but not an oil company…Filling your tank could have stirred up some sediment. Pumping that through the filter could have been the last straw for a pump that was on the edge of dying.


 lion9car:

Filling your tank could have stirred up some sediment. Pumping that through the filter could have been the last straw for a pump that was on the edge of dying.


A gas tank in a car doesn’t sit there at rest. As the car drives sediment is being stirred up constantly.


 MikeInNH:

As the car drives sediment is being stirred up constantly.


You’re probably right.In the event the pump is good and remains inoperative it could be a fuel pump control circuit malfunction.
Federal regulations state that the pump be wired so it will not continue to run in the event of a collision.
Granted, I’m not familiar with details on this car but there should be a fuel pump test plug; somewhere near the passenger side and under the hood. A small red wire with a female plug. Running 12 volts to that plug should energize the pump and tell you definitively whether or not it’s the pump itself or a control circuit problem.
If it’s the pump then it’s had a good life at 15 years so it’s due; or past due.The simplest answer is usually the right one. It’s old, it failed. Time for another one.",,,,
800,Overheating 2008 Ford Focus,Maintenance/Repairs,8,3.8k,"My car overheats when I’m driving at highway speeds for longer than 10 minutes. When I turn the heat on, the engine temperature drops. Some sources say to replace the thermostat and some say to flush the radiator. What should I do?Have you checked your coolant level yet?


 Chrislee:

Some sources say to replace the thermostat and some say to flush the radiator. What should I do?


Both… after you check the coolant level as @pyrolord314 suggests.  Also check to make sure the electric radiator fan is actually spinning.The electric cooling fan is only needed when you are standing still, or barely moving.  If you are overheating while driving at highway speeds, then that is not the problem.
I would first check to make sure that the radiator is full, that the thermostat opens when it reaches operating temperature, and that the coolant is actually circulating.  A defective/weak water pump, or a radiator which is full of sludge could cause this.If the coolant level is ok (in the radiator, not just the plastic bottle), and the coolant has been replaced in the last 3 years, my guess is the cooling system isn’t holding pressure properly.  It might just  need a new radiator cap.  If the thermostat has never been replaced, now might be a good time to do it in any event.  They usually start to distort a little by 10 years of use.My radiator and reservoir are both full. My fan is working. I have even hearing across the radiator and my thermostat is working. I have heat and the heat exchanger helps me cool the engine. I have found that if I rev and hold the rpms at 3000, that will also lower the engine temperature.
I’m wondering if I need to flush my radiator.
Kind Regards


 Chrislee:

I’m wondering if I need to flush my radiator.


Couldn’t hurt.  If I had this problem on my Corolla I’d start w/a pressure test of the cooling system, and the radiator cap.  Since increasing the engine rpm seems to help, next I’d check that the belt driving the water pump isn’t slipping, and then I’d remove the top hose to the radiator and verify I get a big flow of water out of that hose when the thermostat opens. If no big flow, I’d suspect either a clogged thermostat, or a faulty water pump.Don’t forget to check the Engine Coolant Temperature sensor.you ever figure out the problem, mine just started doing the same thing.",,,,

802,Blower motor resistor keeps going out?,Maintenance/Repairs,9,249,"My 2001 mustangs fan for the AC and heat only works on the highest speed but not any of the lower speeds. I replace the blower motor resistor which fixes the problem but within 2 weeks it burns out and again, only the highest fan speed will work. I can’t afford to put a new switch on every 2 weeks. What’s causing the blower motor switch to burn out so often? I notice the dial to adjust the vent air from hot to cold feels burning hot if that’s any help. Also I’m doubtful that the blower motor itself is bad because if that were the case wouldn’t the fan not work at all? Especially at the highest speedGuess number 1, a blower motor drawing too many amps.So just replace the entire blower motor unit?Barkydog is correct; the blower motor is drawing too much current. Odds are if you connected an ammeter to the blower motor you would likely be shocked at the amount of amps being pulled by the blower.
The blower motor is not that much and the blower can appear to work fine even while drawing an inordinate amount of amperage.
Some years ago my wife came home one day and said the blower in out Lincoln had blanked out temporarily. When checked, it appeared to work fine and made zero noise. With an ammeter connected that blower motor was pulling 27 amps on the HIGH setting. That is a godawful amount of current even with a 40 Amp Maxi fuse in place. With a 27 amp steady pull one can safely figure (as with anything electrical) a 50  amp surge current.A spinning motor generates a back emf (basically acting as a generator).   The faster it runs, the higher the back emf.  The back emf reduces the current from the startup value of the motor.  If a motor (for some reason) is restricted in speed, it will be drawing a higher current than designed for at that fan speed setting.  So, if the motor has a bad bearing or the flow is restricted sufficiently, there will be an excessive current, and your resistors are acting as fuses. Pull the motor and check for anything that might be slowing it.


 oldnotdeadyet:

or the flow is restricted sufficiently, there will be an excessive current,


Actually centrifugal fans do the opposite. When either inlet or outlet is restricted, they don’t move any air and with a load reduction, the speed goes up and the current goes down. Block your vacuum cleaner hose to see the effect. The issue with the way it is implemented in the car, the airflow is being used to cool the ballast resistor block and so when that disappears, the resistors overheat and burn up.That’s one of the fan laws.

TesterWell, I learn something every day!  Is the typical squirrel cage fan a centrifugal fan?
Fast or slow?  For our OP, are we saying that a blockage is expected, and the fan is running fast and the resistor is blowing because it is uncooled?   Or, do we think the motor is running slow so the current draw is high?
Maybe this is the old mouse-nest-in-the-airflow problem. I note that the OP has not really stated reduced air flow.blower motor could be the culprit, but also check the wiring at the resistor.  If it looks burnt or melted at all, get a new connector and wires.  I have seen bad wires take out a new resistor.A fan that takes air into its center and then flings it out is a centrifugal fan.
So yes.

People of average height often place coolers, boxes and other items behind the drivers seat restricting the travel of the seat. This may seem to be too obvious but you may want to advise your sister to move the seat all the way back before loading the car.Take frequent breaks and stretch.With the car being fully loaded like that, be sure the tires are properly inflated, especially for the cooler sections of your drive.I’m 6’+ and about 220 lbs. and I own a 2009 Corolla. It’s more comfortable with more room than you might expect. I would expect a 2008 to be at least similar. As long as you can move the seat back and recline it a bit I don’t think you’ll have a serious problem. Unfortunately, since you won’t be passing through Missouri I can’t suggest any attractions along the way.What route are you taking?

Along the way we took in the Great Meteor Crater, as mentioned below and also the Grand Canyon Caverns.40 parallels 66, and sometimes is in the same place as 66 was, but there are other places where they diverge.

My brother-in-law who’s a retired Chrysler Plant Manager owns a Honda Pilot.It seems to me that after 8 years, those problems should have been sorted out, and the main issue is how well it was maintained.You would hope that was true, but the friend of mine with an older Jeep he jettisoned had no luck with it, after years of repeated repairs.  There’s good reason it got a “Beware of the Clunker” award from Carcomplaints.  Also, the Grand Cherokee has the most complaints there of any model Jeep.  That’s sayin a lot!

It sure seems that way but I owned a 1984 Pontiac Sunbird with overheating problems that were never resolved. It still had them at 122k when I got rid of it.It’s a used car and not all used cars are equal. If it’s been neglected and thrashed into the ground then obviously reliability may not apply.
The same would apply if you bought a used lawnmower. One might have been well maintained and garaged; another neglected and allowed to sit outside. One  could be a great mower; the other near junk.
That does not even get into the part about how many miles on it and how much they are asking for it. Either or both of those factors could possibly mean walk, or run, away from it.",,,,
806,XM Radio and car batteries,Maintenance/Repairs,9,4.0k,"I have a 2002 Mercedes C 240. When I bought the car it had XM radio already installed. Shortly after, I started experiencing dead batteries.

 I took it to a repair man and he said it was the seat sensor and “fixed it” for $500.00.

 The problem remained.

 A few other mechanics AND myself suspect that it is how the XM radio is wired.

 Has anyone else had any issues with their XM radio and car battery?

Another dead battery! We get this question a lot… and none of the previous posters ever mentioned XM radio.
There are many possibilites. There is the status of the charging system, the condition of the battery itself, and there can be corrosion in the battery connections. Any of these conditions can be the root of your problem and must be checked out first.
If the battery and alternator are OK then you have some accessory that is always on and is draining the battery. Folks have found trunk lights or glove box lights that are on at all times. These situations are detected in the usual fashion, by taking an ammeter to the electrical system. The process is simple enough but it can be time-consuming.
It is clear that your mechanics (and you) are simply making wild-eyed guesses. Maybe XM radio is to blame, most likely it’s completely innocent. Take your car to a real mechanic who will reach for his ammeter and track down the problem the right way.Normally this kind of trouble is located by measuring the battery current drain then by pulling fuses the circuit is pinned down that has the excessive current flow on it.
You spent a lot of money to have this fixed and perhaps the seat sensor was a problem but you still have the same trouble. I would take the car back to the shop and have them see what is going on. You paid them to do that already.
The radio may be the trouble but I doubt it is. It should only need a small amount of current for the memory. A few other mechanics AND myself suspect that it is how the XM radio is wired. 
I have never heard of such a thing.  Why would you or the mechanics suspect the radio.  It is possible, but it is way way down my list.I have to go with Mr. Meehan here.  What makes you suspect the XM?  Is it a factory installed radio?
After checking the battery and charging system, put a current meter on the battery and start pulling fuses until the load goes away.  Then figure it out from there.I agree with the others, the radio seems unlikely.  Have you had the battery and the charging system checked out?  How quickly does the battery go dead if the car is unused?  If there is actually a current draw on the battery, it will have to be narrowed down at the fuse box, tedious but not difficult.  If you really suspect the radio, try removing (unplugging) it and see if the problem goes away.It might be the radio, but I doubt it is just because it is XM.  When the car is turned off, the radio shuts down, including the XM receiver.Have same problem with both my cars,

Problem Solvers: How to protect your license plate from being stolen 13
Protecting your identity can be as simple as keeping an eye on your license plates.





Security screws?You can’t prevent it.
Just be wary and report them when stolen… and this isn’t I.D. theft because EVERYbody can see the number whether on your car or another. It doesn’t identify you.
Security screws are commonly available in auto parts stores…Commonly available to you and thieves. Thieves know this and buy the “special” tool so this won’t slow them down when  stealing plates.Never had a problem but I guess you could weld them on.  That would stop 'em.  One sure way is to have outdated tags.  Worse case, I think duplicate plates are around $15.  I had one pretty much scrunched up and just wanted one that would look good.
You’ll have to excuse me but we’ve got about 3"" of snow already and all outside work has been canceled for a day or two.  2020.  Who woulda thunk?

808,Left front tire locking up and then releasing while in drive…but not in reverse,Maintenance/Repairs,17,44.7k,"Hi.  I have a 2004 Ford Explorer V8 4 wheel drive.  Yesterday I was on the way home from a 2 hour drive and was on the expressway at a complete stop on a downhill grade.  When I hit the gas, the car started lurching - it would shoot forward, then slow down, then shoot forward, then slow down.
I got the car to the side of the road and called a tow truck.  Just to test - while I was waiting for the truck I put the car in neutral and even though I was on a steep downhill grade, it wouldn’t roll at all.  When I put it in drive - it wouldn’t go initially until I had to put a decent amount of pressure on the gas pedal.  I reminded me a being at a speed bump that you couldn’t idle over and have to give the car some gas to power it up over the bump.
When the tow truck got there - I watched the driver drive the Explorer up onto the bed of the tow truck.  What I noticed was this:
The left front tire was completely locked when he was hitting the gas.  But when he gave it enough gas, the right tire that was working would push the car forward while the left tire remained locked creating friction on the pavement but the car was still moving forward from the other wheel.
Then after 3 or 4 feet - the left tire would unlock/release and start to rotate - causing the car to suddenly lurch forward.  But then after another few few it would lock again.  Then release again.
The thing I found odd was that when the driver later reversed the car down off the truck - the left front wheel worked just fine.  So the car works perfectly in reverse, but in drive the left wheel locks then releases then locks then releases.
Any advice or assistance on what the problem is would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance!I wonder if a caliper pin/bolt came out and the caliper is cocked.
YosemiteI believe you have a bad rubber brake hose on your left front wheel. The last time that I had a bad one it did the same thing. Locked going forward but would slightly release in reverse.Basically have the same problem with my 2006 Dakota 4WD, yesterday it started shimmying and the left rotor singed my finger when I touched it,have to get my crew chief on it seems to happen after the cool weather.Guessing its a sticky caliper ,messed up rubber line or something of the sort-KevinThe wheel bearing could be have failed, the caliper could be loose and hitting the wheel, the CV joint on that corner could be coming apart. All speculation on our part. It is MUCH easier to diagnose if the wheel is removed and you can take a peek around. It could be cheap, it could be expensive, no way to tell. If the failure is not readily apparent when the wheel comes off, you have just ventured into expensive as it is likely inside the front differential.
Good Luck and let us know what your mechanic says is the problem.Is this an “AWD” vehicle (it’s in 4wd all the time) or is it “4WD” where the driver can control the 2wd-4wd function…If it’s 4wd, were you driving in the 4WD position??More than likely a stuck caliper.  Pins could just need greasing.  This seems to be the biggest cause of calipers sticking.  Rubber hose could be bad or the caliper itself.Caddyman - 4WD where I can switch between 4WD and 2WD.  I was in 2WD at the time.“The left front tire was completely locked when he was hitting the gas. But when he gave it enough gas, the right tire that was working would push the car forward while the left tire remained locked creating friction on the pavement but the car was still moving forward from the other wheel.”
This sounds like it was in 4WD as the R/F tire had power going to it…Hopefully it turns out to be a brake problem… But if it’s a front drive axle problem, things will get expensive…It looks like a caliper bolt came out and the caliper is swinging forward and locking up into the wheel rim. Same thing happened to me in my Saturn once.It sounds like Traction Control messing up to me, does your vehicle have it?  Are there any warning lights on?It ended up being one of the bolts that held on the caliper bracket came off.  I had my rotors changed about a month ago and it must not have been tightened securely.
A $4 trip to the hardware store and a couple of hours was all it took - working great now.  Thanks for all the help!A broken tulip joint might be the cause.Super late reply but so happy this post exists.  I had the same exact issue and was initially thinking it was a broken wheel bearing.  Just went back out and was able to shift my caliper by hand with ease so that’s clearly the issue.  Going to go grab a bolt after work and save myself $400.A seized caliper could be hot enough to melt a hubcap.If this is the case,you will need a new caliper.You could buy a remanufactured caliper at 1/3 the price of  the OEM in most autoparts store.I am having a similar problem with the passenger side of my FWD 2003 Impala. I took off the caliper to clean and grease the pins and once I put it back on, the driver side wheel started locking up while the passenger wheel wouldn’t spin. I’ve never seen this in my life. I’ve been having transmission problems before hand but for some reason only one of the front tires will spin at a timeSo are all the caliper bolts in place? That was the problem with both the original lost and one 4 years later.Yes all of them are. I took them out, cleaned them and greased then before putting them back in.",,,,

Any way to test O2 sensor in vehicle?


Not that I know of unless you have a scanner.
But you can bench test it with a torch.
Set a meter to the 2 VDC scale.
Connect the red lead to the senor signal wire and the black lead to the sensor body
Take a torch and start heating the sensor tip. This removes the oxygen.
The voltage on the meter should rise smoothly to about .9 volts.
When the flame is removed, the voltage should drop smoothly back to zero.
If the voltage reading is erratic when rising or dropping, the sensor is bad.

812,Impact tool or breaker bar?,Maintenance/Repairs,20,742,"I need to remove the bed on my 2007 Silverado Classic to replace the fuel sender.  The bolts are very rusted, three have been broken in the past, before I bought it.
Last year, I sprayed down the bolts with SeaFoam and after several days of testing with a breaker bar, I eventually got them all to loosen up but did not remove them, only retightened.  I decided to put off the job for awhile.
I sprayed down the bolts last weekend with PB Blaster and tried with the breaker bar again.  The first bolt did not feel good, like I might be breaking it, so I stopped and sprayed all the bolts with Breakfree.
I was watching one of the PowerNationTV shows a couple of weeks ago and one of the mechanics mentioned that he was using an impact tool on some rusted bolts because it was less likely to break a bolt.
So, opinions.  Breaker bar or impact tool.  BTW, he was using a battery powered (20V) Matco impact wrench.So what if they break , it seems that you would want new rust free ones anyway.Agreed. You should replace them all even if you don’t break them getting them off.To answer your question, an impact gun is just as likely to snap the bolts as a breaker bar.
The best thing to do is heat up the area the bolt screws into if possible.
Then use a breaker bar so you can feel if it’s coming loose.
TesterIt does seem that using an impact lessens the probability of breaking bolts and it certainly reduces the aggravation in getting on with the job.
A would be customer once commented on a seeing a mechanic quickly get the wheels off a car with an impact that using a power tool instead of a wrench took all the work out of the job. I was flabbergasted. Some people don’t recognize that mechanics are paid to repair cars, not sweat and strain.
So just spin them out and replace them. You’ll be much happier with the job when completed and possibly save a few trip$$$ to the chiropractor.


 Rod-Knox:

I was flabbergasted. Some people don’t recognize that mechanics are paid to repair cars, not sweat and strain.


American attitudes toward work and value-of-labor are wholly screwed up. People tend to not consider anything work unless the worker is tired at the end of the job. They don’t think about the fact that they’re paying for the mechanic’s expertise, not the mechanic’s exercise. If all they want is to see someone get sweaty, they can go watch a jogging track for free. 


 VOLVO-V70:

So what if they break , it seems that you would want new rust free ones anyway.


If they break, you have significantly more work in extracting the broken off piece that’s left. If the part they are left in is one I’m saving, I try to avoid breaking them off if I can.I’ve heard this before. The idea being the rattling loosens the rust. Never been my experience. I prefer penetrant and heat then hand tools with leverage sometimes going back and forth to ease them out. If you feel twisting of the bolt, it’s over anyway. But I have rarely had a break where I can get the nut or threaded boss cherry red. They squeal like a banshee sometimes but they come out intact.

I watched a woman’s Pilates class once. The woman women didn’t seem to be exerting too much…but for some reason my heart was racing.The only thing with a battery impact is that you can’t feel what is going on with the bolt.  I would prefer a ratchet rather than a breaker bar just for that reason, but seems like if they are gonna break they are gonna break.An impact is a bit better but with some fittings they are going to break anyway no matter what steps are taken to prevent it. At times I prefer to just cut them off and be done with it; followed by replacing with stainless.
I just spent 2 full days replacing the optional engine oil cooler lines on my Sonoma and was going to replace the radiator connects also. No amount of PB Blaster or finesse would budge them due to rust. Finally the entire fittings were ripped out of the radiator with said Sonoma now fitted with a new radiator also.
And another 3 hours trying to fit the transmission cooler lines which fought me every step of the way while trying to insert them into the radiator connects on the opposite side.1/2"" drive pneumatic impact wrench is the way to go

 db4690:

I’ve got both but with an impact wrench you still can’t feel when you have reached the point where the bolt will break like you can with a ratchet.  There is enough power with an impact to shear the bolt off but if the idea is to try and salvage the bolt, I’d take it a little easier.

This approach might be your best solution.  Then just pop rivet a cover plate back on.

I promise not to show that to your wife. I plan on replacing all the bolts.  Still soaking them.  I think I will try to extract the three that have already been broken before trying to remove the others.
Dropping the tank is not recommended because accessing the wiring and hoses before dropping is all but impossible and they do not have enough slack to drop the tank a little, accessing them and finish dropping the tank the rest of the way, according to several sources on the internet and YouTube videos.Someone on the Lincoln Mark VIII site presented a pattern some years ago for cutting a hole to access the fuel pump under the passenger side of the rear seat. I drew the pattern off for future use. At some point the pump began to fail and the pattern came in quite handy.
Before the hole was cut changing the pump required dropping the full exhaust,  trailer hitch, and tank; which was a wrestling match because of the short wiring harness and fuel lines.
After the hole was cut, changing the pump is a 15 minute job including R & R of the rear seat.
Maybe someone on the net has come up with a pattern for  your truck. The main issue to to prevent cutting through any nearby fuel lines or wiring. With a little care no problem at all.Impact. Start lower power and increase to max. The shocking vibration effect is similar to an air hammer. A breaker bar is more likely to snap it. But as a last resort, go for it.",,,,

It got hit (other driver ran a stop sign), damaging the Vibe’s driver side rear door and quarter panel. My mechanic said the alignment is still straight, and the left rear wheel bearing seems fine. The car is driveable, but going over bumps some of the mashed metal in the rear wheel well hits the tire. The mechanic and a body shop both said the wheel well metal could be pounded so that it is clear of the tire.
The estimate to repair is $5600, and the car is worth about $4700 (retail), so the insurance company has offered us $4700, they take the car, or $3500 and we keep the car.
We’ve had the car since August 2018. As I mentioned it is reliable. Since we purchased it I had a motor mount and a brace replaced, new rotors and pads on the front, new battery, new tires, changed the plugs and fluids. Oh, and I also have a set of lightly used winter tires and rims for the car, too. We were expecting to use it for at least 2 or 3 more years (college student car).

 It_s_Me:

If your state does not have some kind of safety inspection that you have to pass.


Even if your state DOES have a safety inspection, it should not be too difficult to remove the rear wheel and beat the sheet metal back with a rubber mallet or similar, so it can’t contact the wheel any more.  Although aesthetically unpleasing, such a fix should be sufficient to allow the car to drive safely and pass any state-required inspection.
Alternatively, you could get the wheel well fixed professionally for a lot less than $3500 and buy a used door from a junkyard to replace the damaged one.This is a chance of a lifetime to unload a car at about twice what you’d be able to get for it on the market.  I’d take it and run.  Unless you can do some of the work yourself and can use the extra car.
I think it is going to take a little more than “pounding out the sheet metal” though.  That’s more of a reinforced area and not much of a place to pound on.  I think it would really need to be pulled back in place on a rack.  The door could probably be half-way re-worked to be reasonably presentable I guess.

Back in those days you chased estimates and sent them to the insurance company. I got two for $130 each and a third for $200. Insurance paid the $200. The car had cost $300 so I deposited the $200 check and drove the car as is. I ended up selling it for $150 so I actually made money.

During my sophomore year in college I was rear ended while driving an old 1963 Chevrolet.


Yeah I got rear ended in my 59 Pontiac about 1969.  The estimate was about $130 and I fixed it for about $17 for used parts, paint and my free labor.  Back then tuition was $525 a semester so $100 was a big deal.  Poor girl just got her license and it was icy and at the bottom of a hill with a stop light, but fair is fair.In my case I was stopped at a fork in the road waiting to turn left. I young guy about my age had been driving an old Buick for 20 miles with bad brakes and he knew it. He tried to pull onto the shoulder but he hit the car behind mine and there was a chain reaction. The lady in the middle took most of the damage. I don’t recall what she was driving but it was a full size car, probably a late 60’s model, so there was a lot of sheet metal to absorb the impact.


 davepsinbox_157004:

so there was a lot of sheet metal to absorb the impact.


That’s what I thought, too, about the older cars. A friend told me I was wrong. He said modern vehicles are designed to crumple and absorb the impact, which results in less injury to the occupants. His contention was that previous generation vehicles did not crumple, and therefore transferred the force of impact into the passenger cabin.

That is correct.
The inertial forces of an impact will be transferred to/absorbed by… something.
Unless somebody has a death wish, he/she should prefer to have those inertial forces absorbed by the well-engineered “crumple zones” on modern vehicles.Something else to think about is, “How much longer will your daughter be in school?”
College cars lead a tough life, at 143,000 miles it’s nearing the end of it’s life and when she graduates and starts earning her own money she’ll almost certainly want something else.
So if she’s nearing the home stretch and your budget can afford to help her with payments until she graduates, maybe it’s time to upgrade to a work/commuter car?
On the other hand, if she’s in her early years and it’s going to spend a lot of time on or near campus, chances are that she’ll get more dents and dings. (Apologies to the mature, responsible students but many of your classmates aren’t)


 Bing:

I think it is going to take a little more than “pounding out the sheet metal” though. That’s more of a reinforced area and not much of a place to pound on. I think it would really need to be pulled back in place on a rack.


The mechanic who took a close look at the damage a lift thought the same thing you did. He said if hammering failed, maybe he could bend the metal with a long breaker bar, and if that failed, he could remove the problem metal altogether with a reciprocating saw. After thinking more about it, he thought maybe the best option would be to have a body shop put the car on a frame rack to pull the metal out of the way. The one body shop I visited was reluctant to do that. The owner felt there was a possibility the rear doors latching mechanism was broken, and the only thing holding the door closed was the damaged metal. Pull it straight, and now you have a door that won’t stay closed.
I’m going to do some online car shopping today to get up to speed on asking prices for replacement vehicles.I think the two places are being diplomatic . They just don’t want to say let the vehicle go and find something else . Even if it could be made drivable their is a chance that water could get in and cause mold problems . I would not take that chance for any family member of mine .

Except we’re not–or at least I’m not–talking about transferring force into the passenger cabin, we’re talking about transferring force all the way through the whole car. A late 60’s sedan sitting still with the driver’s foot on the brake takes a good bit of force to move. So that much kinetic energy goes toward moving it, instead of the next vehicle. That’s what I meant by absorbing impact. No, it’s not as effective as crumple zones but it’s better than getting hit directly. Sorry I wasn’t more clear.

I got curious and did some “shopping” of my own. Let’s say you get $4700 and add to it to bump it up to $5000+tax etc. Here in the St. Louis area the best deal I found for $5000 was a 2012 Ford Fiesta. Whether it’s worth a gamble is unknown.

I have a 2005 pilot ,which had a drivers side window regulator that came apart which I replaced but when I put new one in I was trying to line up screw holes to window before I connected everything and regulator would’nt work. I read some of the forums and learned that the door light plug needed to be connected. thank you cause I tried the control switch and the little black box first. Worked great after connecting that plugThanks for the feedback.  I also have received a lot of good information in helping me maintain my carsYou disconnected a wire when you removed the regulator. And did not connect it when you installed the new one. And that prevented the regulator from working? I’ll make a note of that.Congratulations on diagnosing and fixing it yourself.

817,Intermittent Steering Wheel Shaking,Maintenance/Repairs,4,144,"I have a 2011 Ford E150 passenger van.

Sometimes on the highway. Sometimes it drives just fine. Sometimes it is worse when braking sometimes braking smooths everything out. I spent a good bit of money Any ideas anyone has on where to start?The first things that come to mind are bad ball joints and/or tie rod ends.  Both are significant safety hazards.
I strongly suggest that you have this van examined by a good independent mechanic’s shop a.s.a.p.    Avoid chain-run places like Midas, Meineke, Monro, Sears, Pep Boys, and AAMCO.Sooo what have you spent a good amount of money on?

818,RPM problems,Maintenance/Repairs,20,560,"Hello,  I’m new here.  I just bought a 2009 429R Roush mustang supercharged at only 12,000 miles on the car. I was shifting to 4th from 3rd at a higher RPM starting a race and I accidently caught 2nd gear. Check engine light came on and lost power so I came to a slow. No smoke or anything obviously wrong.  I took back off and I was in 1st at 3500 RPM, then 2nd gear… then when it reached 2800 RPM I hear crackling noise and loss of power.  I shifted and same thing on every gear except 1st gear. Keep in mind this is a super charged car.  It drives at 55 or 60 and I can drive around in any gear with zero issues unless i go to 2800 RPM I’m baffled at what the issue is.  What do you guys think?


 Jland7:

Check engine light came on and lost power so I came to a slow. No smoke or anything obviously wrong.


When a fault is detected by the PCM the rev limiter may be reduced to protect the engine. Connect to the PCM and read the fault codes. Why should there be smoke?You did what is known as the “money shift”
You over revved the engine and bent a valve or 2… at least… and maybe more.
I hope your credit is in good shape, this will be expensive.


 Jland7:

What do you guys think?


That it’s going to cost you more to fix it than I paid for my last car.I tested that idea, In 1st I took it to 4500… no issues… it’s only happening in 2,3,4, at 3,000 RPM.The last person I know that did that with a Mustang grenaded the transmission.

819,"Odyssey, Town & Country, Caravan",Buying/Selling,13,406,"I have a budget of around $10-12,000. I have narrowed my search down to three minivans. I am looking for some advice on which one would be the better option. Here’s what I am looking at:
2012 Honda Odyssey. 137k miles. Fully loaded and in really nice condition.
2013 Chrysler Town and Country. 102k miles. Not the base model, but nothing fancy. In very nice body condition.
2014 Dodge Caravan. 97k miles. Pretty close to the base model. In excellent cosmetic condition.
I know there are reliability issues with Chrysler and Dodge cars, but I’m wondering if the lower mileage would offset those issues compared to the higher mileage Honda? Any advice would be helpful.Can’t speak for all Chrysler mini vans, but my 02 got 230,000 miles before head gasket failure. My current 05 has 240,000, Going great. My daughters 06 250,000, going great.That’s good to know. My current van is a 2008 Dodge Caravan, and I have 164,000 miles on it. The engine is running fine, but everything else is broken. It needs new tierod ends on the front driver’s side. It needs a new rear axle. I need a new bearing assembly on the read passenger side. And it is leaking oil from somewhere. It’s time to put her down.All the items you list as needing repaired or replaced are quite normal at 164,000 miles.Honda Odysees  have had more than their share of transmission issues so a high mileage situation is a bit of crap shoot with any brand .  If you go dodge then go for the 14  .  The earlier Pentastar’s  had some head issues  which were pretty much gone by 14  .  Wife has a 14    with 105000 miles on it and it has been basically maintenance issues so far ,  had a cracked oil filter cooler fairly early but that was taken care of under the engine warranty  . Been pretty reliable and is still going strong with no rust issues so far here in upstate NY where they salt  until the snow is gone .We have a 2012 Odyssey similar to the one you’re looking at. Had it about 5 years now.
The alternator went out about a year ago; that was around $600 for an OEM replacement.
The only real complaint I have it is the front brake rotors. They seem to only last about a year to 1.5 years before warping. In fact, I need to replace them now. From what I gather, the brakes are a weak point on this Odyssey.
Aside from that, though, it’s been a great vehicle. This is actually our 2nd Odyssey. The first one was a 2003 that started having transmission issues, so we got rid of it.I have a 2012 Ody bought new has all of 20k miles on it. Been thinking of getting rid of it. Do not like the VCM, has TC shudder, no where near the gas mileage they originally claimed it would get and I had one scare where I discovered it was suddenly really low on oil. No leaks, it’s showroom pristine engine compartment and undercarriage. Had a friend with a 2012 Pilot that said his started swilling down oil like crazy. Told me there was a known issue and normally appears before 100k. No idea of the validity of that claim beyond he’s not prone to exaggeration and what I experienced, only briefly. Mine hasn’t done that since but it gets little usage. Other than that, we like the van for its utility and ride comfort.I have had a couple of Mopar minivans, have had good service from mine as several family members have had from theirs.  I have always used mine for both hauling and people moving and they seem equally adept at each.  I probably had the seats of mine in and out more than 50 times.  With the seats out they are better than a tent for 2 person camping.
The faster depreciation and stow and go seating would keep me with Chrysler if I was looking for a used minivan.  I think used Japnese vehicles are overvalued in the marketplace and would only buy them new.Are you in an area where salt is used on the roads? If so, note that the Chrysler minivans are prone to corrosion. Wheel wells, door seams, hood, rocker panels, doglegs. They seem to hold up for the first 7 or 8 years, then once the rust appears, it just seems to take off and consumes the vehicle.If the VCM system on the '05 - '10 odyssey works the same as it does on the later gen odyssey, then the cause of oil consumption is the way the cylinders are deactivated - by disabling the valves. This method causes a vacuum in the cylinder, sucking up oil and burning it off when the cylinder is re-activated. I disabled this on my '08 odyssey by disconnecting the oil pressure sensor used by the VCM system.
In my opinion, if you can find a lower mileage 2010 odyssey, that would be your best bet. It’s an older gen at the final years of manufacturing, so, many kinks were worked out. Lots of information is available on the maintenaince of the car, which is a plus. It seems to me the newer a car is, the worse the maintenaince required to keep it running is.Rear door also deteriates.


 Dappersworth:

The common way of accomplishing the same thing on later years is to artificially reduce the temp sender output to just a hair below normal. The computer will not enable VCM unless the engine is seen as completely up to temperature. The slightly lower temp does not seem to affect open v closed loop operation. However, the caveat is that it needs to be adjusted slightly as the outside temps change between summer and winter. I thought quite a bit about it but never bothered to do the mod and have lived with it.


 tcmichnorth:

Rear door also deteriates.


Right, I forgot about the rear hatch… The 2013 Chrysler van Movybuf79 mentioned is a  5th generation Chrysler minivan. Not sure if Chrysler got it solved by that generation, but fourth generation vans was also prone to rusting on the front fenders where they meet the bumper. Also the hood. Not a vehicle for buy and hold type owners where salt is used, unless they are proactive and perform some kind of rust prevention like a yearly undercarriage and body cavity oil spray. Below is a link to a forum that discusses rust on 5th generation Chrysler vans.
https://www.chryslerminivan.net/threads/5th-gen-owners-do-you-have-any-rust-on-your-van.58545/I have owned minivans since 1991.  I have owned a 1990 Ford Aerostar, a 2000 Ford Windstar, a 2006 Chevrolet Uplander, a 2011 Toyota Sienna and I presently own a 2017 Toyota Sienna.  Despite what Consumer Reports survey shows, the least troublesome minivan was the 2006 Chevrolet Uplander.  My son now has the Uplander and it has over 205,000 miles.
The point is that I am not sure that their is a lot of difference among the makes as far as reliability is concerned.  On a used minivan, the condition and how it was maintained is more important.",,,,

TesterWent out and cleaned them. There wasn’t much corrosion. Still nothing.Check if the fusible link from the battery is burned.
image904×675 30.3 KB
Testercurrently looking for where they’re located.I believe that fusible link is a section of fusible wire. If so it is the first ~6 inches of a blue primary wire with a large plastic permanent connector attaching it to the Blue wire with a red stripe as shown in @Tester’s schematic.  Such fusible links are sold at all parts stores. If that seems to be the problem buy several as you might be replacing it repeatedly until you find the cause for the burn out.
And testing that fusible link wire with a light or a VOM meter will often result in a false “good” indication because enough current to register may be passed but not enough to operate the circuit.Ordered a light tester. Im blind as a bat I can’t seem to find the fusible link! Will keep looking today.There are two main fusible links, one in the wire going from the battery to the alternator and the other is in the wire from the alternator to the junction block.This is fusible link

The drawing shows the link is a blue colored wire that is connected to a black/red wire that ties to the main distribution panel under the hood.


 Cougar:

One end of the link should be tied to the positive battery post connection.


Look again.
The dashed line between the battery and the fusible link means that may not be the actual connection.
It may be at the starter.
TesterThat wiring diagram is for a 1991 C1500, the S10 is different.Update: We found a cut wire that runs from the patter positive terminal. (The one with the electrical tape at the end as it threw sparks when moved) IMG-29653024×4032 2.18 MB
Seems like the one that runs to the alternator but unsure?On the end of that wire it appears that someone taped the wire to the fuse link. a new fuse link should be soldered in.no we put electrical tape over it cause it was live. so there should be a fuse link at the end of this wire?Or were you talking about at the other end where it connects to the positive terminal?There should be a fuse link between the end of that wire and the alternator. Remove the broken wire from the alternator and examine it.Will do tomorrow! Thank you!After seeing the photograph of the wire connection it is no wonder you are having a problem. I suggest you replace that whole connection with something new. You need to find the other end of those wires. Hopefully there are fusible links to tie to. If you don’t have any links in place you would be wise to install them.

I will amend that assessment by stating that an impact that was hard enough to “knock off” two tires will DEFINITELY result in brake and suspension damage to both the front and the rear of this car, which has independent rear suspension.

If this vehicle is still within the powertrain warranty period it should be repaired by a Hyundai dealer.I dont think that it is thoughAnd im absolutely not going to let him fix anything. Him meaning my boyfriend. LolWon’t start how?
Engine won’t turn over?
Any sound from starter?
If you’re literally burning through starters, check all wiring related to the battery, the starter, and the alernator.",,,,

Use a 1/4"" drive ratchet and tighten until snug.

829,Could a tire balance or allignment reduce my cars shaking,Maintenance/Repairs,8,241,"about 3,000 miles ago i noticed my car swaying, almost like the wind was pushing it however i was holding the wheel straight. With newer car I thought that was super weird with only 80k miles.
So noticed my wheels in the front were burned from launches, just about illegal level where the head is barley hiding, and the back ones are almost new.
So i would say front tires 3/10 thread left back tires 7.5/10 thread left.
I swapped the back tires to the front and vice versa, now there’s shaking in the wheel while im driving 50+ rather then swaying.
so my question is, can a tire balance or alligment fix partially this issue.
or am i screwed and gotta grab 4 new tires and an alligment.Are you just trying to crash and burn because every thing you seem to be doing is going to lead to that .
Having front tires with more thread then the rear has been proven to be unsafe .
As whether balance , alignment and four new tires will solve this will only be known after you have it done to this mystery vehicle.If i get the alligment done first, doesnt fix the issue, throw 4 more tires on same size, will that throw off the new alligment? or am i better off getting tires first then the alliment.
EDIT: now thinking about crashing, maybe if i do enough burn outs i can get the front tires to match the rear now.


 Blakensnake:

Now, I have to believe that you are engaging in trolling.well damn, guy before your post was on some, maybe alligment will work, maybe wheel balance will work, maybe new tires will work. IDK
So at that point it’s like damn well since front tires lose more tread do i just lower the fronts naturally, or hit the corners with a little boost. because we can make the tires the same if thats the biggest issue. and can save me on a $500 new set. (even tho itll need to be done later next year.): now thinking about crashing, maybe if i do enough burn outs i can get the front tires to match the rear now.
I smell troll again.If this is your track day Civic, the front tires likely have taper wear out to in and that is causing the wandering on the highway. Swapping to the rear will help. Alignment won’t help.
The vibration is a balance problem, I’d bet. The 2 wheels off the rear need to ne balanced. I’d guess you may have tossed a wheel weight.There may be a belt separation in one of the tires.
This can cause a back-and-forth swaying of the vehicle.
Now that they’re in front, it’s turned into a vibration.
Belt separation
TesterNo one can see your car over the internet. First all the steering and suspension need to be examined for wear or damage.  The tires need to be examined for cupping , uneven wear, balance and condition.  If you need new tires, balance and alignment should be done at the same time.  Burnouts cost money, high speed cornering costs money, any kind of racing costs money. Only you can decide if the pleasure you get from it is worth it to you.
It is an equation I gave had to balance in my past.",,,,

Could be that or some starter issue. I would go to an independant mechanic to get the charging system inspected because its no fun getting stranded in the middle of nowhere-check your battery cables and make sure they are clean and tight.  no green stuff, and you shouldn’t be able to move the cable where it attaches to the battery.
-Next time it won’t start, move your gear selector into neutral and try to start (assuming this is an automatic transmission.)
-don’t assume your battery is good- actually get it checked.

That would have been to perfect time to verify that the starter is failing, I guess they don’t know how to diagnose starter issues.
When the engine won’t crank, measure the voltage supply at the starter battery cable and the solenoid connector.I ended up getting it towed to a local mechanic that i went to get my engine actually fully replaced, hoping its just a starter issue. I didn’t even think to test the alternator or battery cables


 Tucker-Manis:

Just to clarify…
Is this the same VW TDI whose engine you had to replace less than 1 year ago?yes sir. has been running great until lately.let me rephrase that, it runs great! just a starting issue it seems


 Tucker-Manis:

I didn’t even think to test the alternator or battery cables


A bad alternator wouldn’t cause this. A bad alternator would cause the battery to go dead and that apparently hasn’t happened.I think your mechanic should be able to quickly diagnose this if the problem is quite repeatable. Or, at least eliminate some variables quickly if this is something oddball. While I agree it is not the alternator, it could be the ignition switch, cables, starter, ecu or a bad sensor.I suspect a bad crankshaft position sensor. Dead cheap and easy to replace, so nothing lost if that’s not the issue, but sounds very much like what I’ve experienced on 2 different vehicles.",,,,

 Darren13:

That is entirely possible.  In the case of your new car, the problem is likely to be just a bad electrical connection, or possibly a bad O2 sensor, but even if there is a more serious cause, it will be fully-covered under warranty.
If it makes you feel any better, when my 2002 Outback had about 1,200 miles on the odometer, the CEL lit up, and it turned out to be just a defective evaporative emissions solenoid.   After that was repaired–in less than 1 hour–the car functioned flawlessly for another 10 years.

832,P2647 Rocker Arm Actuator System is Stuck Open,Maintenance/Repairs,5,40.9k,"Yesterday the check engine light came on 03 Accord EX 4-cyl auto, the code is P2647. According to the dealership and O’Reilly print out it can be a number of things, so I am looking for some guidance. The car starts running rough after 2700 rpms, and then (if you keep pressing accelerator) dies. So I can drive it now as long as I do not accelerate too much. (That is great for the gas mileage, but does not help on the on-ramps)
I did replace engine oil and filter yesterday, but the engine light is still on with the same code. The car has 175K miles.
O’Reilly manual suggests replacing:
•	VTEC Oil pressure switch
•	VCT Solenoid
•	Pressure switch
•	Solenoid Valve Assembly
The Honda Dealership said it might be:
•	VTC Oil Control in Valve Assembly
•	Valve Timing Oil pressure in the switch assembly
Any help in figuring out the faulty part will be much appreciated!I think you’ve dobe well so far, but at this point it needs the honda shop. There are a few possible root causes here.
Your engine uses a valve system that essentially has two camshfts, one foor low RPM operation and one for high RPM operation. When the ECU detects that the engine is at higher RPMs, it activates a secondary rocker arm system that changes the engine’s valvetrain operation fromm the “slow speed cam” [my term] to the “high speed cam”. It does this by (via a solenoid) “flipping” a control valve that redirects some pressurized oil to a hydraulic channel that engages the high speed rocker arms. It’s using the oil as a hydraulic fluid.
What’s gone wrong is that either
the ECU is not sending the signal based on the engine speed
the solenoid is not switching the valve that redirects the oil
the oil is for some reason not activating the highspeed rockers
or perhaps everything would work fine but the oil pressure is blocked from the valve assembly, which would mean the valve is getting switched by the solenoid but there’s insufficient oil oressure to do anything.
Sorry, but there’s no magic pill, no single likely part. Someone knowledgable will have to do some in depth diagnosis.This is from a Honda service tip dated 03/01/2005:

DTC P2647 (VTEC oil pressure switch circuit high voltage)
Replacing the VTEC oil pressure switch usually fixes the problem. If it doesn’t, then press on with normal troubleshooting.
Took it to the shop, $150 later for VTEC oil pressure switch and everything is fine. Thank you everyone for your help!I have the same symptoms with my Honda CRV 2005. We replaced all those things and the problem still persist.
Code was P2646 (vtec pressure switch voltage faulty). May 28th 2020; The mechanic replaced the valve timing solenoids. Replaced Right outer Tie Rod. + Front alignment. (paid $593.19).
Literally the next day it was still struggling to accelerate. cant go above 3000 rpms. everything you mentioned.

833,1995 Mazda B2300 (Ford Ranger) parking brake adjustment,Maintenance/Repairs,10,452,"My parking brake pedal goes almost to the floor. The cable system has one cable that goes from the pedal to mid-truck. At that point it connects to two separate cables (one to each wheel). I expected to see an equalizer/adjuster where the three cables meet, but there is none.
The actual brake shoes have a star-wheel self-adjustment system, which I think is typical. I believe the primary purpose of this system is to keep the shoes close to the drum, so that only a small amount of travel is needed to actuate the brakes. (by either the brake pedal or the parking brake pedal). Some of the YouTube videos are calling this the adjuster for the parking brake, but I believe the correct adjustment is independent of the parking brake.
With that intro is my problem. What if one of the rear cables has stretched.  There seems to be no way to compensate, since there is no equalizer. Do I need to buy a matched set of cables? (I don’t think there is such thing.)  It seems that all three cables need to be matched and new for the correct pedal adjustment. Am I missing something?Your foot pedal may have an adjustment that takes up slack. Possibly lifting the pedal, then pushing, will do the trick. Look at the hinge point of the pedal to see if there’s a ratchet mechanism there.It has a self-adjusting parking brake.



It Still Runs 7


How to Adjust the Rear Brake on a Ford Ranger 7
The Ford Ranger uses a servo-style, rear drum brake system that is equipped with self-adjusting and parking brake functions. When the brake shoes are adjusted properly, the result is a firm pedal feel and proper parking brake function. Once adjusted,...





TesterTester:  Those instructions will set the shoes appropriately close to the drums, so that when the hydraulics are actuated, only a little travel is needed for the pistons.
In Ford theory, then only a little travel is needed for the parking brake cable on each side. BUT, what if one of those cables were too long. One cable  would tighten the shoe before the other side had achieved full tension. There is no equalizer for the tension.
Shanonia: I think my immediate problem is a rear cable, so that only one side is fully actuating.  So I am looking for a way to adjust one rear cable.  It is silly that there is no equalizer mechanism.If a parking brake cable is stretched. then has to be replaced.
As there’s no adjustment.
TesterI think that is what I am slowly deciding. I believe a shrinking sheath could give the same symptom. The sheath would be under compression.All the cars out there in the world with a simple little equalizer bar (cost of $1.00) to keep this from happening.  Don’t those engineers think of everything!A common problem on the Rangers is the equalizer slips down the sheath, causing the same problem you’re having.

On my older ford truck drums all around when that occurs it has always been the shoes are not adjusted correctly.  Check that first esp if pressing on yhe brake pedal seems to have too much play.  Also verify the parking brake actuator and the entire cable system is lubed as spec d br ford.  I had a parking brake problem that turned out to be sticky pedal and cables.I am getting good suggestions.  I don’t think it is the sheath problem, but I will take a second look. I also plan to pull the offending wheel again to see if something is out of order. This will give me a closer look at the adjusting mechanism.Well, I am back, this time to eat some crow.  It turns out the whole problem was operator error.  While I knew in theory about how the self-adjusting mechanism worked, it turns out that I was a little slow to put that into practice.
When I re-assembled the brakes, I carefully adjusted the  shoes for slight drag when I put the drums on, carefully noting which way the adjusters worked, since I was going to do the final adjustment after a little driving. “Make the teeth go up” I said to myself, and clearly the self adjusting mechanism did just that.
Quiz:  can you see what I did wrong?  When I under the car on the opposite side of the adjustment screw, I needed to make the teeth go down. Duh!  Can you tell that this is the first time I have replaced drum brakes?  BTW: the parking brake works fine.",,,,

836,Strange clicking/scraping/grinding noise while slowing (with video link),Maintenance/Repairs,2,122,"Hi Everyone, first time posting here. I attached a video of the ridiculous noises coming from my 2007 Ford Freestyle. It’s a metallic-sounding scraping/clicking noise coming from under the car. I usually hear it when I let up on the gas (as shown in the video) and not when accelerating.
I stopped driving the car until I figure out what’s going on. I’ve had issues with the exhaust pipe leaking but I patched it up so I didn’t think it would be the source of the problem but I’m not so sure now. I checked for loose rocks/rust in the rotors but they’re fine and still have life left in them. The brakes were a little tight-fitting and I thought they might be the source of the issue so I filed them down a bit but still hear the same noise.
My last resort is to replace the the exhaust system and see if that fixes the problem but figured I’d ask people that knew more than me about this stuff before spending that kind of money on a whim.
Any comments at all are appreciated (even if you just say “wow, I have no idea what that could be”).

837,1979 Toyota 20r Distributor,Maintenance/Repairs,8,285,"20R engine in 1979 Celica
I was wondering why the mileage suddenly dropped from 24 to 15(!) mpg, with the engine barely able to idle.
I checked fuel pressure (good), but vacuum was only 15"" (it was 20inches last I checked over the summer).
My first thought was a leaking intake manifold gasket. But today, I took the car on a long trip, and when I got into the garage, I heard a squeaking/scraping sound. It sounded like it came from the distributor, Sure enough, if I pressed on the cap, the sound got worse.
So: I removed the cap, and noticed what looked like carbon tracking. Cap was changed 21,000 miles ago. The Toyota FSM says to merely inspect the cap and rotor every 30,000 miles. I change them at 20,000 mi intervals anyway, keeping the old one in the trunk.
Am I looking at distributor problems? There is NO play when I try to shake the rotor shaft from side to side. The only problem it has is that one of the springs for the advance mechanism weights is weak (no longer available from Toyota)
I’m just wondering how a distributor cap could wear out so quickly.
Distributor is original, 247,000 miles
Picture:Dist Cap1944×2592 910 KBTo be brutally honest, I’d first be concentrating on why your engine vacuum dropped down to a rather mediocre . . . in my opinion . . . 15""db4690: Last night, I swapped dist caps with an older one. Car idled better, with vacuum again at 20"". Needle was steady, so I don’t think I have anything wrong with a particular cylinder, valves, or intake manifold/gasket. But I’ll be calling an auto electric shop to see if they can rebuild the distributor. Low vacuum and noise started at the same time.
The old distributor cap looked like new. This one was full of carbon deposits, with the rotor also looking worn out. They should last longer than 20,000 miles.
BTW: When I measured the 15"" of vacuum, the car was idling at less than 200 rpm (versus the normal 800 rpm), about to stall out.
I may be wrong, but I wouldn’t expect to see normal vacuum at that speed.db4690 (or others): An update:
Again this morning, vacuum was low (15""). I had the car running a few minutes, and it went back up to 21"". In addition, the engine RPMs increased.
So, I’m looking at a vacuum leak in a vac hose? I’m thinking that a TVSV may be closing at normal temp, thereby blocking the path of a leaking hose.?
At any rate, the distributor is making noise, its spring for one of the advance weights is weak, it’s chewing up dist caps, so I’m still sending it out. RockAuto only sells rebuilds of customer’s own dizzy. Or should I deal with a local shop nearby?  (there is one)
So I have two problems, not one. And I was apparently wrong. Very low RPM didn’t cause the low vacuum.There are more vacuum hoses and valves on a 1979 20R engine than on anything else I’ve ever seen. I had one on a 4X4 pickup. Plenty of possible leaks. The one I had to deal with the most was the AAP (Auxiliary Accelerator Pump) diaphragm. It would develop a leak and suck excess fuel into the engine. Eventually I just blocked off the hose that led to the AAP housing. The engine started and ran fine without a functioning AAP system.
The fact that your problem seems to go with an engine cold - engine warm condition suggests you are on the right path, looking into switching valves and their hoses, etc. Good luck!Not great, but I’ve seen worse:
EDIT - I had the wrong Toyota, here’s the Celica, lots of potential leaks:
image1000×643 128 KBI recall those Hondas with 2 multi function vacuum control modules attached to the firewall. It was best to unbolt them from the firewall and leave as many connections to the intake manifold connected and set the intake aside with everything in tact.Yeah, I was thinking of the last carbed Hondas, a real rat’s nest of vacuum hoses.
image1000×1232 234 KB
Recalling the old distributor days I am thinking the carbon buildup on the cap  was indicitve of a bad ground, don’t recall what ground, maybe the ignition coil. Buildup on the rotor indicated some other issue. Maybe some one here can recall.",,,,

That’s just my theory cause I stumble upon it while looking for some tutorial on how to splice the brake linePut the gear shifter in NEUTRAL when you try to spin the wheels.What was your goal? To only change tires?
you changed front 2 tires alone?
all 4 tires?
do you have emergency brake on?It is not the guide pin, i removed the calipers and brake pads, to where it is just the rotors n axle … the rotors won’t spin. When tires are on i can’t reverse or drive the rotors would lock.jack up front end. start motor. put it in gear. what happens?I am really curious as to what this could be.  If you have it in neutral with the calipers removed, the only thing I can think of is seized wheel bearings, but for both sides to seize at once just when you took the wheels off is about as likely as being killed by a meteorite.
You don’t by any chance have it jacked up by the axle shafts , do you?No i didn’t jack it up that way, it’s really weird. I just change the tires and lowered it, i tried to back out n it felt like the car wanted to move but the tires wouldn’t move. I jacked it up again and spinned the rotor, it moves an inch both ways. And locks. I removed the calipers, break pads. Same problem … when under i tried turning the rotors , that locking sound wound come from axle more towards the middle of the car…  like the entire axle is locked from the tranny… I’m clueless and need to be at work in the next 6 hrs …That is bizarre situation! try disconnecting the negative battery cable and leave it off for a while. Sometimes this quick fix will tell the computer to relearn all its parameters.I’m guessing you’ve got a CV joint or transmission problem there OP.  Make sure the suspension parts haven’t locked up somehow, that can happen when you lift the car by the chassis. Worth a quick look anyway, make sure the struts aren’t all the way up or down,   but I doubt that’s the problem.   The transmission may just be stuck in P for some reason.     If the ideas above don’t pan out, take a look at the shifting linkage from the shifter to the transmission.  This assumes you have an automatic.   Check the transmission fluid level and fluid condition too.   & Watch the CV joints as a helper rotates the rotors, notice anything unusual happening?I replaced my u joint and when I put my axle back in it wouldn’t spin freely why?On what type of car? Which U-joint? What transmission?The axle U joint on a 96 Dodge Ram 1500So why did you post it under a Caravan thread?
Again I’ll ask, which u-joint? Which transmission?
And now: Do you have a 2 piece driveshaft? Do you have a limited slip axle? Is the entire rear-end jacked up? Or on the ground? Is the truck in neutral? Why did you change the u-joint? Was it floppy loose, or did it break apart?2 piece drive shaft and the back end is on the ground it’s the passenger front side I joint I replaced cause it was looseIf you aren’t going to answer ALL the questions I asked, I can’t help you.
I’ll add some more. So you have 4 wheel drive? (I guessed since you told me it was a front driveshaft) You said driver’s side - is that the driveshaft from the transfer case to the front axle? Must be since this truck has a solid front axle. Is the transfer case in neutral?
You may have a NV231 transfer case that has no real neutral so if you want the front joint to spin, you need to jack up the rear axle.Greetings!

841,Car Insurance: Who do you trust?,Maintenance/Repairs,39,5.4k,"Am moving to the US from Europe so I don’t currently have (obviously) car insurance. My proposed car of purchase would be a Prius. Are there suggestions of insurance companies to either check into or avoid based on your experience?I’ve had “AMICA” auto insurance for about 30 years without any problems, I’m sure there are some other good companies out there.I have used (except for the time I was stationed in Germany) State Farm as my insuror.  My son uses American Family.  Many military use USAA or GEICO and have had good service.
Progressive is getting a bad rep around here, because they tend to bargain harder on final repair price in case of an accident.  They also get a bad rep from making “low-ball” offers to settle a case where the vehicle is totalled.
I would price around once I got settled and get several price quotes.Before you go far with the car purchase inquire about insurance prices on what I presume is a new car.
I think they will likely consider your out of the country time a lapse in insurance and give you surcharge for that. Charges can be quite hefty if insurance rates are higher where you are locating.
If its high I would suggest maybe getting an inexpensive used car that you only need liability. The collision/comprehensive make the substantial portion of your insurance bill and can be avoided for a short period.The insurance industry here is highly regulated.  Your best bet is to check with several companies and compare the coverage they are offering and the price.  Prices are not highly regulated so they vary a lot from one  company to another.
In addition many insurance companies offer better prices if you bundle home and car insurance.  Just ask about it when you are checking prices.I’ve been insured by Nationwide (home and auto) for over twenty years and I can report that we’ve had an excellent business relationship. My local agent is independent so he passes along my insurance issues to the national office without hassling me. He stays in business with good customer relations rather than hard-nosed haggling.You can get a lot of different advice here…but it really depends on what state you’re moving to. For example Geico is NOT offered in Massachuestts. Also some states Insurance and rates are regulated.
Wait until you get here and then check with people local to your area.You can get certification of some sort for a clean driving record (assuming you had one), from local authorities in city you previously stayed in Europe. Some insurance companies will accept that (and your old drivers license) to avoid surcharges that a new, “inexperienced” driver would get.I agree 100%I’ve had Allstate since I’ve been driving.When I first came to the United States at the end of the 1960s, I had a bit of trouble finding car insurance. The first company I approached rejected my because they had no way to access my previous driving history. This created problems because, if one company turns you down, all the others assume it is because you are a bad risk. Then, they try to charge outrageous premiums. An independent agent who understood the situation found insurance for me at a reasonable price.
Our insurer for home and car for more than 30 years has been State Farm. They have treated us well.
I do not trust Geico.I would contact a Independent agent,maybe a couple.
Insurances  companies themselves will be very happy to load you up with every coverage they can.Independent Insurance Agent.I’ve had State Farm forever.  Always been good to me in the rare times I have been in an accident.
I always hear complaints about Allstate.  I would never go to Geico.  First, they send mailers out at least every month (sometimes every week) which causes a lot of environmental damage.  Then I remember something about they will drop you if they find you use a radar detector?
I am a Costco member and they are always pushing American Express insurance that they partner with as the lowest rate available.  Not true.  I asked them for a quote and they were nearly $50 higher than what I was paying State Farm every 6 months.I’ve had GEICO for 39 years on my Mom’s policy and on my own.  I’ve meen pleased with the services rendered when required.  I’ve had it so long that I remember when you really had to be a government employee or close relative to get it.  Not so now.  If you have a VIN on the Prius you want, they will give you a firm quote on your insurance.I have had SafeCo for a few years now and they have treated me pretty well by giving me lower insurace rates every year without an accident/ticket. I have been happy with them.

Who told you that crap???
Here’s a NICE example…My brother-in-law when he retired from Chryco needed a new vehicle for his business. He was a Plant Manager at Chryco and part of his perk as a exectutive was two cars LEASED for him by Chryco every other year. The leasing included ALL maintenance AND insurance. But he needed a third vehicle for his business. Because he hadn’t had any insurance from any company for the past 15 years he was put in the high-risk pool…even though he handn’t had a ticket or accident in over 20 years. He was LIVID…Called EVERY SINGLE INSURANCE COMPANY and even called the State Insurance bureau…All they said was “Sorry…but you’re considered High Risk.”The best auto insurance companies are;
Erie, AMICA, USAAA.  GEICO is slightly less competitive price-wise.I was rear ended by an idiot whose insurance was Progressive. They are total crooks even attempting to violate state insurance laws.I would avoid Allstate. They have a bad reputation for paying claims.",,,,
842,Bmw jerky downshifting automatic,Maintenance/Repairs,5,253,"Hey guys I have a 2016 BMW 435i GC and I’ve been having this issue for months now. Whenever the car is rolling to a stop or I brake approaching a red light the car hesitates and the rpms flick up to 1500-2000. This happens between 5-30 mph. In sport mode the rpms spike higher around 2000-2200. Car is perfect on highway but as soon as I’m coming to a stop sign or red light i get this surge. The rpms would spike up 2-3 times until i make a full stop. I thought it was a vacuum leak but I got a smoke test and everything looked good. I’ve read a lot of other discussions that had similar symptoms but there has not been a clear answer on how to fix this. I tired resetting the adaptive throttle response but that didn’t help. If anyone knows what is causing this issue please let me knowSounds like hard downshifting to me. Last time you changed transmission fluid? How many miles on the car?Car has 56000 miles I’m not the first owner so idk when the last time the transmission fluid was changed. Got the car at 50000 miles. Imma change the transmission fluid tomorrow and get back to you.Before you get a trans fluid change Check the gearbox software is up to date through a Dealer. A find change could make it worse, this is not uncommon on European gearbox’s as they can’t predict the wear characteristics when they first design the software.Ok I’ll go to the bmw dealership tomorrow and see if there is a software upgrade for the gearbox. I will let you know what happens thanksLook forward to hearing how you get on👍",,,,
843,Timing belt install incorrectly,Maintenance/Repairs,3,189,"I own 2014 VW TDI Passat.
I just done timing belt change and 100k service and oil change.
It’s cost me $2,550.
I never want my car to broke down in the middle of driving. It was my worst nightmare just to think of it.
6 days later car made weird noise suddenly stop in the middle of the road.  I was on the way home from work 2 am.
I tow my car and called VW dealership about incident.
They said "" if I tow my car they will take a look at it""
from my house to dealership is 49 miles.  Seriously I didn’t want tow my car that long distance.
And I didn’t want dealership to hide something from me so I found mobile disel mechanics.
He came check my car found timing belt wasn’t installing correctly.
The mechanic explained to VW what is wrong with my car. Then they sent me tow truck.
I asked them to bring me a loaners car.  But they said no and don’t have it.
20 minutes later VW called me to come pick up loaners car.
I asked again to bring me a car.
They said No.
I called uber suddenly VW called me again not to come because they had to make paperwork for repairment request,  it’s not done so loaners car is available but can’t issues it.
I’m not impressed by VW, Im woman I don’t want VW to walk all over me would you please give me your advice what should be know about it. How should I handle this situation? Please help!!!You do realize that your vehicle is no longer under warranty, and doesn’t need to be serviced by a VW dealership?
TesterWho did you pay $2550 to do the “timing belt change and 100k service and oil change” . . . ?!
whoever that was . . . that’s who needs to look over what they did, since there seems to be some question, as to whether they performed the repairs correctlyGiven the price , I assume she had it done at the dealer although it would have helped if she had said that.
My advice would be to talk nicely to them if they are the one who messed it up as long as it looks like they are going to fix it.  Keep a record of everything. Phone calls dates times and who you talked to and what they said, keep all paperwork.  Give them the opportunity to do the right thing but build the evidence if you have to go to court.
I do not know what state you are in but the NY State Attorney Generals office helped settle a dispute I had woth a dealer and let me avoid going to court.
I really did try being reasonable first.",,,,
844,Life of a Lexus,Maintenance/Repairs,18,62.6k,"What’s the useful life of a Lexus ES 350.  I have 63k on it, and no real problems, but I tend to get nervous around 60k, and wonder whether I should start thinking new.  I’ve never kept a car much longer, but am thinking I can easily get 100k on this one.  Any thoughts?Just about any car will last longer that 100K miles as long as you take care of it.  This means at least following the maintenance schedule for all items (for example: changing the timing belt as recommended).Consumer Reports recently had an article on long lived cars and trucks. One couple had a Lexus which served the faithfully and had over 400,000 miles son it. Another couple had Ford Ranger truck with over 400,000 miles on it.
If you maintain your Lexus by the book you should be able to do the same thing. There is no need to get nervous in a Lexus that has 100,000 miles on it.
Many regular posters her have cars with very high mileage on them. Aside from taking good care of them, the cars had various things in common:


The basis design is sound and the detail engineering is good, resulting in a reliable vehicle. Your Lexus matches that in spades!


The manufacturer supplies nationwide parts and service and will do so in the future. Again, no worry with a Lexus or Toyota.


The electrical and electronic components are well tested and replacement cost is such that you don’t need to scrap the car if something fails.


Of all the luxury cars, the Lexus is probably the most reliable and worry-free, and you can look forward to many more miles of good service. If your Lexus has a timing belt, replace it when the manual indicates. Also, the transmission fluid should be changed, along with the filter, every 30,000-40,000 miles. This item is listed in your manual as being required much later, but experience has shown that the shorter interval assures very long transmission life.
I would also flush the cooling system every 40,000 miles and use Toyota only coolant.
With the above care, unless you live in the rust belt, you will be on your way to 400,000 miles of happy ownership.
There is a very long list of luxury cars that become unreliable after 100,000 miles and very expensive to keep running. Your Lexus does not fit in that category!My ES300 has 140k, and it’s doing fine.  60k is nothing, seriously. What, exactly, are you nervous about?  That you will have occaisional unexpected repairs?  Sure, but the cost of those is insignificant compared to what you’re spending getting a new car everly 60k or so.Really…what are you worried about? The only vehicles I have ever known about personally that would not get to at least 100K was the Vega and the Yugo. They are long gone. With normal maintenance your Lexus should see 200K without many problems. Some teenager will probably be driving your ES 350 in the future with 240K on it and will be doing donuts in a parking lot somewhere. Your Lexus should have a long life ahead of it.The Lexus ES 350 has above-average reliability and longevity–like all Toyotas.
And, after all, this car is simply a Toyota Camry in fancy dress.
As with any other make of car, maintenance is the key.  If you have never before looked at the mfr’s maintenance schedule that is in your glove box, then do yourself a favor and start using it as your guide to maintaining the car.  And, since all major mechanical components on the car are the same as on a Camry, any competent mechanic can maintain it–at a far lower cost than the Lexus dealer.
Modern cars, if maintained properly, will easily make it to 200k miles.   You should have no significant problems with this car for at least 150k miles if you will invest the money needed for proper maintenance.Ran into this convo while trying to buy a newer model Lexus  350 with 165k miles on it. I’m getting it for a steak but nevertheless mileage worries me .
BTW I purchased a 2003 Corolla back in 04 with around 14k miles. We move around a lot and travel a lot . By 2008 we saw our odometer pass the 299,000 then it stopped. By my own admission We are terrible at oil changes have done little maintenance and never changed any kind of belt. The only thing weve purchased for the car are tires ,batteries , Starter & a water pump . since 07 when it hit 300k miles we have easily gone another 300k probably in the next few years. If in 5 years we did 300k . How many miles do you suppose we’ve gone in another 9 years ?? She won’t stop her poor little heart keeps ticking and is severely neglected. Talk about faithful.
2003 Toyota Corolla is the best car ever made . She will always be my luxury vehicle

10 years to the day the engine went out


Can you explain “engine went out” for us?Found an 02 ls430 for $825. Has broke timing belt. I could buy it to sit in. Will last forever.Motor   15000.It has 75000 miles
Taken excellent care of it
Now I own a huge piece of tin that looks new and doesn’t run!The engine went out


 Debi-5:

The engine went out


That means a lot of things so it is impossible to know just what happened to this well taken care of vehicle. Surely the shop told you why the engine failed.Sounds like you had some bad luck.  The ES350 is one of the more reliable cars out there.Last month I wrote an estimate to replace an engine in an ES350, there is another ES350 taking up space in the parking lot that needs an engine replacement.
Once a month one of these cars are towed in with an empty radiator and a damaged engine. The plastic radiator cracks and the operator motors on until the engine is damaged.
These cars are so good that most owners have never lifted the hood in ten years. Some that have lifted the hood found that everything is covered with a plastic panel, none of the reservoirs are visible. There are small peep holes to view the coolant reservoir and brake reservoir but being 90% concealed the owner doesn’t understand what they are looking at.My wife bought a Lexus ES350 their first year (2007). Over 250k miles and still going strong. It runs and drives like new. Love this vehicle. Only actual repair besides normal maintenance was a water-pump at about 70k miles. And that’s it.I’m the first to agree that a car that gets no service (like checking under the hood) will have problems. I don’t see that as a problem with the model.",,,,
845,2012 Legacy - repairs will be more than its value,Maintenance/Repairs,43,1.3k,"102000miles on my 2012 Subaru Legacy. Tooling down the interstate, the car starts shaking, and all the dash lights come on. Got it towed to a repair shop (reputable) and was told it would cost between 3500-4000 to repair it. A bad valve was causing compression issues. Car, in good shape, only valued at 5500 retail. Why fix it? Now, what do I do with the car?How do they know it’s a bad valve?They put it on a computer and that apparently was what the error code read. That’s what I was told anyway.Which engine does the car have?2.5i four cylinderWith very little info to go on, I will make an assumption here based on the complaint, bad valve, and compression issue.
The assumption would be valve lash has tightened and burned one or more exhaust valves. Yes, I know Subaru and other car makers only recommend a valve lash check (and a totally bogus audible one at that) every millennium or so but that recomendation is pure garbage.
Valve lash should be checked every 30k miles. Failure to do so leaves the car owner at risk for valve/cylinder head damage. In your case it’s likely that valve lash was tightening up over time and during the interstate tooling the tipping point arrived.
The price for what I assume (again, a dreaded assumption) is burned valve damage seems a bit high to me. You might price this job around and if possible you might clarify exactly what was said to you so the word assume and its various forms could be dropped from the discussion.Thanks for the help. The Subaru dealer called me and said the repair would be between $4000-$5200, more than the car’s value. I bought the Subaru because they were supposed to be good cars. Mine only had 102,000 miles on it.Remember that the Subaru dealership is motivated to sell you a new Subaru. Also remember that dealerships usually cost more (often a lot more) than independent shops. And finally, remember that the guy you talked to was probably not a mechanic, but a service advisor, which is dealership speak for “salesgoober who may or may not know anything about cars.”This is a headgaskets repair in disguise. No worries. Take it to a non dealer shop, pulll the heads, replace 1 or both. It’s not 4000$You can have it towed to the junkyardYou have received good advice above.  First of all, it is very common for these type of engines to need new head gaskets at around this mileage, and the cost to replace one head with rebuilt doesn’t double the price of the job.
Second, you should be able to have this work done for less than $3k.  It is not necessary to have this repair done at a dealer, and in fact would be better to have it done at an independent shop which will use better-quality aftermarket parts.  Dealers generally use nothing but genuine OEM parts, which are sometimes the best, but not always.  Their labor rates are often higher than other shops, as well.
Third, and most importantly, one should not fall into the trap of comparing repair costs to book value.  What is important is not how much it costs to repair your car versus what you could sell this car for on the open market.  What is important is how much the repair costs are versus the alternative (which for most people would be junking the car and buying a different new or used car).  Unless the car has other issues, such as body damage, rust, salvage title, etc, it makes sense to do the repairs.What @bcohen2010 wrote is the correct view.  The value of the car is its value TO YOU, not its retail value.  Which would you rather own, your current car, repaired at a shop that specializes in Subarus (not a dealer that specializes in selling new cars) or another used car that you can buy for the same money as the cost of repair?ok4450, I have a question. I was surprised the Subaru did not have hydraulic lifters.  Don’t most other cars?
Mechanical valves and 100,000 mile head gaskets makes me a “never Subaru”.@oldnotdeadyet. Back in the 1950s and early 1960s, some of us had the opposite viewpoint.  We thought solid lifters were better.  In his book, “What You Should Know About Cars”, Tom Mccahill thought a properly adjusted valve with solid lifters was quieter than a valve with hydraulic lifters.  He argued that hydraulic lifters required the use of detergent oil which he didn’t like. Mccahill said that he preferred to have detergent in his bathtub, but not in his engine.  He argued that the detergent held particles in suspension and they were whipped through the engine bearings instead of settling to.the bottom of the oil pan.Dis the Subaru dealer actually analyze the vehicle or only take the word of the shop?  You need a second opinion and that must be done in the shop, so this means another tow.
The computer code will not identify a bad valve.  It can identify a mis-firing cylinder and that is about it.  It takes more in-depth trouble shooting to find the exact cause of the problem.  For what is at stake here, I would have it towed to the dealer and pay for an in-depth diagnosis, including a compression test, a cylinder pressure test with sound monitoring at both the intake and exhaust for an air leak and a cooling system pressure test.
It is quite possible that you only need head gaskets.  Also, did anyone check the coolant level after the incident?  Low coolant would be a big clue that it is the head gasket.Subaru has used hydraulic lifters a few times over the years but for the most part it’s been solid lifters.
Needing a valve adjustment and not having it done which leads to a burned valve issue does not make the car a bad one. Valve lash is a maintenance item which should be performed every 30k miles IMO.
Consumers can be given a pass because their owners manuals (and this includes other makes also) may recommend a 100k, 120k miles lash inspections. That is done for one reason; to make your car appear to need less maintenance than it really does. And service advisors who know little only recite the corporate line.
On top of that idiocy, they also recommend an “audible” lash inspection which just compounds the idiocy factor. There is no way on God’s Green Earth that a mechanic can listen to an engine and determine what the valve lash is. I’ve been dealing with solid lifters for approx. 50 years and there’s no way I can tell what they are doing with my ears. If one is excessively loose it can be detected audibly but how does one know that a quiet lifter  which is about to burn a valve exists? No one can.
I still think this repair (even if both cylinder heads are needed) can be done for far less than the given estimate. In most cases the heads can be reworked with a few valve seat replacements and a full valve job. They have to be pretty bad to reach junk status.Thanks ok4450I have had it towed to a Subaru dealer. They have not run any tests on it yet. The shop that AAA took it to are the ones that said what it was, and that they couldn’t repair it as it needed special tools. They are a reputable shop, but I will wait to hear from the dealer. Thanks for the input.I’m going to wait and get a final analysis from the dealer. The original shop it was taken to has a very good reputation both for doing good repairs, and for their pricing. So if they say they can’t repair it, I believe them. I, of course, did not want to take it to a Subaru dealer, but it was a last resort. The other concern I have is, if the repair is equal to the value of the car, and I get it fixed, I will be married to that car forever if other things go wrong.I think I would have it repaired because it should sell or trade for at least enough to cover the repair costs. I might even drive it for a while and decide if I wanted to keep it.  It has very little value now.",,,,
846,2016 Honda Civic Sdn - Same old Honda AC issue,Maintenance/Repairs,5,233,"I’ve also had the same issue with my AC since the first year I bought it. I continue to take it back to the dealer and they replaced the compressor at first but that did not fix the problem. The last time I took it in they said they could not find a problem. The AC will work for a while but then turn off. It is getting worse now and I live in a very hot area so I need my AC. This has really changed my mind about ever owning a Honda again. They were never able to fix the issue and I’m extremely disappointed. I purchased a brand new car just so I could continuously have AC problems. I was going to take it in a private mechanic but I’m buying a new vehicle today. It will not be a Honda.Excuse me but the same issue as what? As who? We can’t see whatever/whoever your reply is directed toward. Anyway, sorry you had an ac problem with your Honda and best of luck with your next vehicle.Honda is getting such a distinct reputation for C compressor failures Car Talk has begun to use it as an example in our extended warranty stories.The most common problem I’ve seen with Honda AC’s is the expansion valve.

 GorehamJ:

Honda is getting such a distinct reputation for C compressor failures Car Talk has begun to use it as an example in our extended warranty stories.


For years, the A/C on Hondas was downright anemic in comparison to every other mfr’s A/C.   I believe that they improved the strength of their A/C in recent years, but then they had mucho problems with the durability of their compressors.   Why has A/C been a consistent problem–in one way or another–for just that one manufacturer?I have read things on the Internet about Honda’s issues with AC, because I own a Honda and so far it’s been OK, but I like to keep up.  Anyway, the story I read somewhere was that Honda had created a system of management of the AC compressor that alters the frequency of the compressor coming on based on engine speed, vehicle speed, throttle position, and who knows what else but it is done to improve fuel mileage on Federal testing.  It means the compressor goes off and on far more than typical, and cause the compressor relay to fail.
Like most internet based knowledge, the expressions of opinion in this post are not necessarily those of the poster, or of the poster’s posterior.  You are on your own.",,,,
847,Can driving with misfire cause engine damage?,Maintenance/Repairs,8,380,"Title. Can driving with single cylinder misfire due to lean condition  cause major engine damage and if so what? (Piston rings, valve stems, etc.) I have a misfire on cylinder 3 on my 4 cyl car for the first 1-2 minutes of driving then it goes away. What damage do I risk to my engine if any if I continue to drive it like this? Mechanic said car probably has a weak fuel pump. My funds may not allow me to fix the issue for another couple weeksA mis fire puts unburned fuel in the exhaust and can overheat and damage the catalytic converter.
Try another mechanic, I doubt a weak fuel pump would cause a misfire consistently on the same cylinder.
BTW is this a 1968 Cortina with 145,000 miles?
How about telling us what the car is, make, model, year, mileage, maintenance history etc.


 SteveCBT:

A mis fire puts unburned fuel in the exhaust


What if the misfire is because an injector isn’t injecting fuel?It’s not perfect, but most manuals tell you to shut off the engine if the CEL is blinking, to avoid doing damage; but driving with the light on is OK.
You might have leaking injector. Pour a bottle of Techron cleaner into your gas and give it some time and miles to maybe clear up the problem.


 It_s_Me:

What if the misfire is because an injector isn’t injecting fuel?


Is that what the “lean condition” means? I’d think too little fuel wouldn’t necessarily mean none.It might.  Cat at risk.  Also could overheat and damage valve etc.  Could be benign for the most part too.  Best to get it diagnosed asap imo.A bad fuel pump would cause a misfire on all cylinders randomly, not just one cylinder.
Likely causes:
Intake manifold gasket
Fuel injector
Fuel injector wire (personal experience with this one)
How do you know it’s a misfire due to a lean condition?“Lean” means that there is either too much air or not enough fuel. Instead of replacing parts, this can likely be diagnosed quickly by checking fuel trim values on a scan tool with live data. You may also have more than one issue, like a bad spark plug and a vacuum leak for example.Again, “lean” doesn’t necessarily mean no fuel. It means an improper mixture. I agree with @Dappersworth that it’s not the fuel pump. Bad or leaking injector is more likely.",,,,
848,First Place Finish Car Care System,Maintenance/Repairs,19,18.3k,"I am buying a new car! My dealership is pushing the First Place Finish Car Care System, a protection for interior and exterior for $500. They reapply it every six months for 3 years and you get a little kit with all the products. I see you can buy the products separately from the website. I am assuming $500 is a rip off, but are the products any good? Any one have experience with this? Thanks, Janetyou are paying up front for 7 detailing jobs at $70 each…would you do that normally?  Not many would choose that option…of course it is not worth the money…your choice.$83 for a full-on detailing job is actually a very fair price. However it’s unlikely your car would actually need a detailing job every six months, unless you’re basically neglecting it.Your Sales Person Is Competing For A First Place Finish In Dollars Generated For The Month.
Tell them you’ll take the car without it and think about it for a little while and get back to them. See what kind of story they give you.
I have found that any of these offers that pressure you into making a quick, one-time-offer deal are not very good.
CSAA typical car sales ripoff.  Probably nothing wrong with the product, but it’s no different than what you can buy at a Walmart for $10 or less.  And you won’t be getting a detail job every 6 months, just a wash and wax.  Way too much $$$.Pay me the $500 and I’ll send you a kit consisting of a bottle of car wash soap, a bottle of NuFinish, and a spray can of Scotchgard. I’ll include floormats.
It’s a rip off. Use the items I listed, maintain your car properly, and you’ll be just as well off and about $480 richer.I know a place just up the road from my house that’ll detail the car front to back for about $120. But not only are they cleaning the seats, carpets, and body, they’re also cleaning the engine bay as well. They offer varying levels of detailing besides that, but I don’t think they charge more than $60 for the basic detailYou make a deal with a car sales person and then the dealer sets you in front of another guy (or gal) who then trys to sell you stuff like extended warranties, and this junky product.
If you spill something on the car seat you can buy a number or products at your regular supermarket to clean it.  It is more money for the dealership and they need to sell you this stuff to pay for the fancy lounges and waiting rooms in the building.
Learn to say “NO” repeatedly and forcefully.  Eventually you will get your new car.I’m real late with this and I know you brought your car already but one thing I found out after purchasing it, was that every BMW dealer does not carry this product.  I purchased my vehicle and car in another state.  The state I live in never heard of first place finish so my money basically went down the drain.  The reason I purchased it was because my older BMW upon trade I noted fade in color from the sun.  what’s great about this product though is that I only have to wash my car - no wax treatments at all and it comes out shining like a great investment just from soap and water every time!!!“every BMW dealer does not carry this product”
Why would you assume that every BMW dealer would carry a particular brand of car wax that has nothing to do with the car’s manufacturer?
That is like assuming that because one BMW  dealership has a Pepsi vending machine, all BMW dealers will have a Pepsi vending machine.  Except for the cars themselves and the OEM parts for those cars, car dealers have the latitude to feature any products that they wish to carry.Yet another flashy name for a box of near worthless and overpriced products. Pass on these products.
A Nissan dealer I used to work for did this on every new car they sold. At the time the paint protectant for example was priced out at going on 300 dollars and was added to the window sticker. If the customer paid this without question then fine. If the customer negotiated this, at best, down to zero dollars the dealer lost practically nothing because the product cost was about 5 bucks and took half an hour of time from their near minimum wage detail guy. Do the math on that and compare to the 300 dollar figure.
One trip to the car wash will remove what is essentially a very thin wax and the interior protectant is nothing more than a Scotchguard product.Remember Polyglycoat?
That was the worthless, overpriced paint protectant being flogged by car dealers back in the '80s.
This “new” product may, in fact, be the same scam product under a different name.
As the veterans of this board know, any products that are pushed by the dealership after you have settled on the purchase price of the car should be avoided like the plague.Never purchase anything from a dealer that can’t be seen. Sure! They can tell you they applied an interior/exterior protectant. But how would you know? These products are invisible.
TesterI have paid for this finish on all four of my Subarus. I do not have a garage and I would not take my car to a detailer often because of inconvenience. I do go to touchless car washes. If I occasionally have someone hand wash and wax it I have the kit for them to use. My dealer refreshes the exterior finish anytime I take it there. Each of my cars has kept a great finish which added to my trade in value. I’m a senior citizen and consider this addition to be a good decision for me.Like said, people wouldn’t be selling stuff if there weren’t some that would buy.  Glad it worked out but me thinks after ten years the original poster has either traded or turned the car into a washing machine.So Bonnie, what part of the country do you live in, roughly how many miles do you put on a car before trading it in, and how much does this benevolent dealer charge you for “refreshing the finish”?
The finish on my son’s 96 Camaro here in hot, sunny Oklahoma still looks new without ever being refreshed at all.No charge to refresh. I live in NC.Happy for you and your son.

Stock lugnuts for the car measure size : m12 x 1.50. hex  size : 19 mm
Does this mean the 6 spline will be 1.50 and 19mm in size.

TesterBefore ordering something from a Galaxy far away just go by your local tire and wheel shop . They might have just the socket you need and you can see that it fits before you pay for it.I got some nice rims for my daughters 2012 RAV4 as the OEM’s rusted around the air stem, no way to fix that.  The nuts for the new rim are a standard size but sit pretty deep in the rim.  A normal lug wrench is too thick to reach the nut.  I use a deep well socket to reach them.  I keep it in the back with the jack in case she has a flat on the road.


 Blakensnake:

Or can the input be (m12x1.50 19mm) and the output of the bolt be completely different like could be 21mm that fit.


With those small lug nut wells in the wheel you may have to continue using the spline type lug nuts. 19 mm nuts might fit but I doubt 21 mm will fit. Check if your 19 and 21 mm sockets will fit in those holes.Got it done 19mm 6-spline worked. Luckily autozone had one size and one drive for the 6 spline and luckily that 19mm was right for it so bless that i dont have to wait couple more days for amazon or rock auto.
One thing to ask car community without doing new thread.
The old rotor screws were messed up and i ended up stripping them and drilling them out. and not putting rotor screws in the new one, i assume thats alright with the wheel there.You asked what type of lug nut to use but you didn’t buy any lug nuts.



 Blakensnake:

Got it done 19mm 6-spline worked.


The hex size on the spline socket has nothing to do with the spline nut diameter. The spline sockets usually are stepped with both 19 and 21 mm hex sizes so spare tire wrenches of both sizes will work.Those are assembly line screws to hold the rotors on.
Just like when they used to install spring washers on the lug studs to hold brake drums on.

850,2011 Subaru Outback - Shakes,Maintenance/Repairs,17,607,"Car shakes & Steering wheel shakes when accelerating at 2500rpm (lower than 2000 rpm not much shaking)
At highway, when accelerating at 3500 - 4000 rpm, shakes and start to make rattling sound.Make sure your wheels are on tight! Maybe one is bent, or a tire is misshapen from damage.Is the check engine light lit up?
Or–much more serious–is it blinking/flashing?You probably need to balance the wheels.wheel had re-balanced. issue not solved.
mechanic suspect bearing or cv axle.
any ideaBad wheel bearings don’t cause the wheels and steering to shake. Cv axle can be the cause of excessive vibration if they are worned enough and should click on sharp turns when this happen. Also, a bent wheel can cause excessive vibration and is the cheapest fix.Driving on tires with a broken steel belt can affect the car ride and is very dangerous.Does this 2011 Outback still have its OEM Continental tires?   I ask because I–and many other owners of that model–had an incredible amount of high-speed shake with those tires.   Road Force Balancing would help, but only for a few thousand miles, when the high-speed shaking would return.   Essentially, those crappy Contis would not “hold” a rebalance for more than a few thousand miles.
My problem was completely resolved by switching to Michelins, but other Outback owners were able to resolve it by switching to other brands.   The universal cure was to get rid of the OEM Continental tires.Thanks corollaguy1, your explanation really good including the concerns of driving the car. actually getting excesive vibration when hitting the gas.
my friend mechanic is still puzzled (suspect bearing or cv axle??? ).
For bearing, bad bearing gives vibration and sound like rattling or two steel hitting each other.
Cv axle seems good, no sound when turning, boot seems ok and no leakage.
He told to get bearing replaced first. hopefully he solved the issue. let you know once done.It was previously on continental(all season) when I bought it with 180000km, just replaced last Nov2019 using michelins for winter & BF Goodrich all season.
I went to auto repair shop to confirmed balanced,
bf goodrich has been balanced fine.
shaking then with sound issue is still there.


 eugenejay:

Car shakes & Steering wheel shakes when accelerating at 2500rpm


A worn inner CV joint can cause a shake while accelerating, the shake usually begins at 40 MPH and will go away when you release the accelerator. A worn inner CV joint won’t make noise while turning corners, that noise would be from a worn outer joint.
Failing wheel bearings make a humming sound to a roar, depending on the severity.Shop says vibration is drivetrain?
None blames motor?
Are you swapping tires on 1 set of wheels?
Or do you have 2 sets of wheels?Hi Nevada545 you got it, thats exactly what I feel when accelerating. have to control my accelation to not to have it shaking.
great info on the cv joint.
Havent order parts yet, I think to go for cv axle replacement first.
let you know…yeah, that was done on the wheel balance. still shaking…Changing cv axle on the driver side today. will update later or tomorrow.
Thanks to al your advice.Jack the car up and secure. Grab the left and right side of each front tire and give them a good hard shake. It should be totally solid tight (aside from the normal steering movement). Grab the top and bottom of each tire and do the same. If there is any slop, locate exactly what is wiggling loose, having a second person help.
If a wheel bearing is bad enough to cause vibrations, you will detect it this way. You will detect a majority of suspension issues this way. You can then shine a light on the control arm bushings and make sure they’re not torn, cracked, deteriorated, etc.
Grab ahold of the axle and give it a bit of a shake. A bad CV axle might sometimes wiggle a bit and you can detect slop at the joint. These will often clunk when turning one specific direction when bad.
If you still find nothing, and tires are balanced and match your vehicle, then take it to a professional. Try not to accelerate and rev too high if you want your transmission and engine to last.

How to Clean Your MAF Sensor 4
A clean MAF sensor can restore 4-10 horsepower to the wheels, which is a significant number for just cleaning a sensor. Here's how to clean your MAF sensor.





Tester


 nbpt100:

Any thoughts?


It should be possible to clean the wire w/a QTip, but it seems considerably less risky if you don’t touch the wire at all, and just direct a spray of the correct cleaning solution.   It’s your sensor though, so you can clean it however you like.  If you try the QTip idea let us know the results.  Isopropyl alcohol comes in different strengths, so be sure to use the strength  (%) recommended.If you choose isopropyl, be aware some are 70%, others 99% pure. Walgren’s 91% comes in a spray bottle, $3.79. Wally world has the real stuff (as in Tester’s video) for $7.29.

853,2003 Eclipse Alternator Problem,Maintenance/Repairs,65,15.0k,"I am not getting any charge from the alternator at the battery.  Normally I can figure these things out, but not this time.
Here’s what I’ve tried so far:

Took the alternator off and had O’Reilly test it. It tested OK all three times they ran the test.
***When I put it back on, it was charging 14.4 volts.
I replaced the worn out negative battery terminal connector. Alternator not charging. Had to throw away the old connector, as it is split.
I had the battery fusible link tested and it’s OK.
The 7.5 amp “alternator” fuse is OK.
I removed the battery and had it tested. It’s OK.
Still no charge coming from the alternator

Help!!!Try cleaning the ground connection on the chassis.Measure the field control voltages at the alternator, this will indicate why it is not charging.That is my next suspect.  I’m a novice, so where do I find that, the ground?
Before the charge ended altogether, I had been getting periodic voltage  cutbacks . . . wipers slowing down, headlights dimming, power windows running slow.
Thanks.The end or ends of the black cable that goes from the battery.


 JLB2:

**When I put it back on, it was charging 14.4 volts.


So it later stopped charging? Intermittent charging could be the  brushes going bad. Probably need a new alternator.The ECU is what controls the voltage regulator output from the alternator.

TesterAre you getting that 14 volts at the alternator or the battery cable end?
The red dash warning light is operative isn’t it?When the engine is idling make sure the alternator is spinning and that the alternator drive belt isn’t loose and slopping and slipping around on the pulley.  That’s the first step.  Next, again at idle, make sure you measure the same voltage at the battery as at the alternator.   With a volt meter, measure between the two battery posts. Probe right in the center of each post, not on the connector.  Then over at the alternator, measure the voltage between the B connector (the big thick wire that runs directly to the battery +) ,and the alternator case.  Those measurement should be the same or nearly the same. What are those measurements?  Next measure the voltage drop between the B post on the alternator and the Battery + post.  What does that measure?
As Tester posts above, on many newer vehicles – presumably yours included – the alternator charging scheme is figured out by the engine computer.  In days of yore the alternator figured it out by itself. But with newer cars and all the electrical gizmos they have, it requires computer-think.  For example if you are waiting for a stop light and the radiator fans are on and the AC is on, even tho the battery may need some charging the computer won’t allow the alternator to kick on, b/c the extra load on the engine would cause the engine to stall.  Instead the computer will wait until you have started back up and driving down the road,  then  the radiator fans turn off, then it will allow the alternator charging to kick on and charge the battery.  So if the above voltage measurements don’t show any problem,  something may be wrong with all that too. For example the computer gadget that senses whether the AC is on or not thinks it is always on, even when it isn’t.


 GeorgeSanJose:

if you are waiting for a stop light and the radiator fans are on and the AC is on, even tho the battery may need some charging the computer won’t allow the alternator to kick on, b/c the extra load on the engine would cause the engine to stall.


This cars computer will not stop the charging system at traffic lights, the field will be interrupted if the engine speed drops below 400 RPMs but that means there is a drivability problem. The benefit of computer controlled charging systems is to adjust the charging rate according to battery temperature for battery life.
This is an old car, newer vehicles employ greater control of the charging system to save fuel but this does not apply here.hmm … well, another idea, the computer may be thinking the rpms are below 400 then, so it won’t allow the alternator to charge.  OP, does your vehicle have an rpm gauge on the dash?First of all, thanks . . . I appreciate the help.  I’ve had this posted on a Mitsubishi Eclipse forum for two weeks, with no reply.
I have tried to keep my explanation simple, but . . . .
Here’s some answers:
I started the engine, and it is a fast idle, 1000 RPM.
The voltage at the battery was low to begin with, because I have not charged it for awhile . . . 12.3.
When I started the engine, the voltage at the battery terminals dropped to 11.5.
The voltage at the B connector and the Alt case is the same, 11.5.
The voltage between the B connector and the + terminal on the battery is ZERO.
Belt is snug and alternator is spinning.
The battery dash light was not on when I started the engine, but after about five minutes, it came on, then off, then on, then off.  I shut the engine off and put the charger on.

The longer explanation is that it has been in the process of failing for a couple of months.  Then, two weeks ago, it failed to start when I was leaving Wal Mart.
I got a jump, got it home, and charged the battery.
When the battery was charged, 12.7, I started the engine, and the voltage was 12.4.  It continued to drop over the next 1/2 hour, until I shut it off at 11.6.
I took the alternator to O’Reilly, and it tested OK.  I put it back on, started the engine, and the voltage at the battery was 14.4.  Success, right?
The negative battery terminal connector was crappy, and didn’t fit snugly, which has been a problem in the past, so I put a new connector on.
The alternator has not been charging since.
I have not checked the ground yet.I wonder if you have a bad battery. After charging it, it should not drop it’s charge this quickly, unless you have a short in the system. I would remove both cables from the battery, charge it fully and let it sit overnight and test the voltage again. If it drops, its a bad battery. Then do the same fully connected too the car and see if the voltage drops. If it does you may have a short somewhere.Item 5 of my OP, I had the battery tested and it is OK.
It is a Wal Mart battery, and they tested it.  From what I understand, they charge it and then load-test it.  It took a couple of hours.
But, I can do what you suggest.
I still suspect a bad ground.
Battery is on the charger now.

Is this the battery ground?


 JLB2:

The voltage between the B connector and the + terminal on the battery is ZERO.


This would be normal because you did not include a ground. This test actually has no purpose, so omit it from your diagnostics.



 JLB2:

When I started the engine, the voltage at the battery terminals dropped to 11.5.
The voltage at the B connector and the Alt case is the same, 11.5.


This would indicate that the alternator is not charging. Either the belt is loose and not spinning the alternator fast enough or the alternator is bad.
Maybe I missed it, but if you have not checked the belt tensioner…that is where I would start.
A fully functioning alternator should put out 14 volts.
Yosemite


 Yosemite:

This would be normal because you did not include a ground. This test actually has no purpose, so omit it from your diagnostics.


Checking voltage across wires/terminals is valuable information. It can indicate if there are bad connections. For example, if I place my meter probes on the battery positive post and respective connector body, they should read zero volts indicating a good connection. If there is corrosion, there will be resistance and in that case you might read some voltage drop across that connection indicating it is bad. In this case, the zero volt reading indicates the connections between the points are likely to be good.Yes, that yellow and black wire is your ground wire.  You have to find the other end where it goes to the body and clean and tighten it.  The new end is fine for now but a new cable is a more permanent fix.
We don’t have O’Reileys ere but our Advanced and Autozone will check out your charging system on the car and I think you should get that done.  I loved the Mopar alternators from the 60s.  New brushes cost 25 cents and could be changed on the car with a Phillips screwdriver.So where that black and yellow wire is bare wire, and fastened to that clip is not the ground?I don’t see a clip. I just see the ground wire disappear behind some other part of your car. That end should be tightly fastened to the body of the car. You can also measure the voltage by touching the positive (+) terminal of your battery and the other lead to any exposed metal part of the car.",,,,

It could be a bad OP sensor - or actual low oil pressure for some reason.The Trailblazer/Envoy platform uses a pressure switch to determine if oil pressure is present or not.

When the computer sees 0 oil pressure, it lights up the check gauge lamp or, if you have a DIC, will display the stop engine message.
Your problem could just be a failing pressure switch. Or, the problem may be real and you have no oil pressure due to insufficient oil in engine, pump failure or obstruction of the oil flow inside the engine.A few seconds I was at a street light.

What a joke, to have a fake oil pressure gauge just to save a few pennies in manufacturing costs!  If all I wanted was an idiot light to tell me that the engine has no oil pressure, then I wouldn’t pay extra for a full instrumentation dash, and if I did, I’d expect the oil pressure gauge, battery voltage gauge, etc. to be displaying the actual information–not some made-up value of what it “should” be.
Are all GM vehicles this way?  I have driven several Chevrolet Express cargo vans, and a Chevrolet Astro van as work trucks, and I currently own a 2000 Chevrolet Silverado.  All of these were equipped with battery voltage and oil pressure gauges.  Are the oil pressure gauges in GM trucks fake too?A lot of Fords also typically have a “fake” engine oil pressure gauge
If pressure is within specs, the needle will always be right in the middle . . .



 bcohen2010:

There’s often no choice . . .
you either buy the car with the gauges, “fake” or not
. . . or you leave and buy a different vehicle



 bcohen2010:

No . . . they use real engine oil pressure sensors, not engine oil pressure switches
There is a difference between an engine oil pressure sensor and a switch
The Fords have a simple engine oil pressure switch, yet the cluster has what appears to be a gauge.  yet electrically it doesn’t function as a true gauge.
Those older GM work trucks you mentioned . . . I know for a fact that the engine oil pressure gauge will definitely be on the low side if you do in fact have rather low engine oil pressure, say 8psi, enough to keep the red oil pressure warning from turning on, but not exactly stellar, either.  Rev the engine or cruise at 2500rpm and they’ll display a much higher reading.  So what you see is the truth
And the battery voltage gauge is also telling you the truth.  I’ve verified this with my multimeter countless times.  On those GM work trucks, at least


 TwinTurbo:

This is true for the 4.2L I6 engine. From what I can tell, the V8’s in the Trailvoys and the full size trucks used an actual oil pressure sensor.

Also a basic obdii code read.

It’s easier to calculate that the center of mass is not the correct spot if you make the the tank diamond shaped with a distance 1 to each corner from the center. The 1/4 area point is a distance 1/sqrt(2) up from the bottom point. The center of mass of the triangular bottom half of the diamond is a distance 2/3 up from the bottom.If we are going to morph the tank, I’ll morph it into two identical rectangles placed into a TEE shape. Then the center-of-mass of each rectangle is obvious, and it clear that they are different distances from the intersection line of the two. For a rectangle of size LxW, one moment arm is L/2 and the other is W/2. This “proves” that the line of equal masses is not the balance point. There is nothing “special” about a circle that changes this principle for the fuel tank.I was wondering about this answer and didn’t get a chance to look at it until now. This center of mass idea would yield a top ?half? of the half-tank that was nearly 10% larger than the bottom. If the tank were diamond-shaped, as Dekabg suggested, the top portion would be 25% larger.
You?d think that Click and Clack would have an assistant on the show that could check these puzzlers and answers for accuracy.
Congratulations Denise from Hawaii for correctly guessing the incorrect puzzler answer.Yep, it’s an obvious, but wrong, answer to the problem
just as you say.
A hypothetical mismatched pair of brothers on the playground,
(call 'em Maximus Tappet and Minimus Tappet) would have
first found out this principle on some Boston area see-saw.
They had to discover the distance-from-pivot rule in order
to properly balance.
I guess they’ve forgotten the playground wisdom of
their long-departed youth.Again, your’re over-analyzing the problem.  The solution assumes uniform density of the fuel.  If the density of the mass resting on a lever such as a teeter-toter was uniform, then it would balance.  If a fat kid on one side was to spread his mass over his entire side of the lever and a child of lesser mass did the same on the opposite side, the teeter-toter would fall in favor of the fat kid every time.  Think of the fuel in the tank as a mass resting on the fulcrum that is equal at every point.  The cardboard “slice” is a brilliant example of using assumptions to simplify a problem.The true way to avoid over-analysis is to check every idea by experiment.  If you are one of those who believe the balance point is the right answer, I have two suggestions:

Find the balance point of the semicircle pizza board, and cut the board into two pieces along this line. Then weigh each piece and you will find they are not identical.
If you don’t have scales this sensitive, tape a coarse graph paper over each portion, and count the squares. You will find the two portions do not have the same area.

I’ll repeat: the calculus of finding two equal areas is entirely different from the calculus of finding two equal torques (balance). The 1/4 line is not the balance point.Again, your're over-analyzing the problem...You're under-analyzing it, and not understanding the problem, or the answer.Oldnotdead suggested an experiment to prove this. While I’m not going to take the time to try to cut out some cardboard and balance things, etc. Here is a graphical representation of the problem that I posted in the other thread on this matter. I created a semicircle in AutoCad the same dimensions required by the problem. I let the program tell me where the centroid, or center of mass, was. I then created two regions based on that centroid. They are most definitely not the same area, which would equate to mass in a uniformly dense material, of course. I also created a diamond-shaped tank (as suggested earlier) with corners 10 inches from center. Indeed the difference becomes even more apparent in that shape.Great drawings, jt1979. Now can you show the location of the COM of the TEE that I suggested above?  That shape shows the equal masses clearly, and the fact the COM is not at the “expected” location.And, for those who don’t have a scales, but like “balance”:  take the two pieces, and tie thread to them and hang them from each end of a ruler. That is, use the ruler as a balance to see which piece weighs more.Oldnothead, it sounded like this is what you were talking about.LMAO, I just realized I wrote “old-not-head” instead of “old-not-dead” in that response. A simple typing error, I assure you; not trying to call you a knot head!The only thing I would add is the measurement showing the balance point.  However, given the data you do show, I can see that it is 8.50.
So the COM is at 8.50 and the “1/4 line” is at 10.00. Of course, they are different numbers for every different tank shape. I don’t think you have given these two numbers for the cylindrical tank.I’m slowly approaching the “oldknothead” time of life.“oldnotdead” is definitely correct.  As Tom and Ray mentioned the week after the original call, the integral calculus is a little ugly, so I just created a simple Excel sheet (attached) and divided up the lower half of the tank into 1000 slices.  Imagine each slice as adding a teaspoon of fuel to the tank.  Actually, we’re filling it from the mid-point down to the bottom instead of bottom-up, but mathematically it’s all the same.
I can explain the various columns in detail if anyone’s interested, but the bottom line is this: Counting up the area alone, the 1/4 mark is at 0.404Radius (0.202Diameter) below the center of the tank.  Using the center of mass approach, you get 0.424Radius (0.212Diameter), which is a 5% error.  Pretty close, but definitely wrong.
The reason that it’s as close as it is is because the half circle is sort-of close to a rectangular shape, not super-imbalanced top-to-bottom.  As some of the other posters have noted, as the shape gets more and more imbalanced (e.g. triangle, T shape), the error becomes larger and larger.Fascinating analysis!  I too had jumped to the conclusion that balancing a cardboard cut-out supplied the correct answer.
But I also got hung up on an earlier step in the solution.  In their answer, Tom & Ray said “Using 10th grade geometry, he drew two chords on the circular piece of cardboard to find the center of the circle.”  It sounds like they’re talking about this technique:
http://www.mathopenref.com/constcirclecenter.html 1
But that requires improvising something that you can use as a compass.  There’s a better way, using only the right-angle corners of the pizza box:
http://www.mathopenref.com/constcirclecenter2.html 1I don't think you have given these two numbers for the cylindrical tank.The center of mass on the cylindrical tank is shown in my first drawing to be at 5.7359 inches above the bottom. In the earlier threads relating to the puzzler that started this whole mess, I, and many others, calculated the correct answer for the quarter tank mark to be at approx. 5.96 inches above the bottom if I recall correctly.",,,,

U.S. – 14 Oct 20 2



Tesla's back-to-back price cuts bring sticker on U.S. Model S below $70,000 2
U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc  cut the price of its Model S ""Long Range"" sedan in the United States to $69,420, its website showed, following a tweet https://bit.ly/2H0JCP0 flagging the cut earlier on Wednesday from Chief Executive Elon Musk.





What a bargain!  I’ll take a dozen of them.Can it tow my boat?By now, Tesla likely has paid a lot of the nonrecurring costs for the Model S, if not all of them. They can afford to drop the price and still make money. Tesla also has a burgeoning market in China, unlike any more traditional manufacturers.Then again as we read about Muntz, sold his cars for $5000 but cost $6000 to make.

It does move so I think it is attached to center pin shaft. Gas gauge works. ?image3264×2448 1.22 MBI have zero info on this car or the way its cluster works, but generally when a temp gauge or a gas gauge goes straight to the top with the key on, it means there’s a full 12 volts to the gauge instead of the lower voltage that comes through the sensor.  That’s the old school system; this might be some sort of computerized set-up.  I would probably try to take the cluster out and see if the connectors are all hooked up fully and if wiggling any wires changes things.
There’s probably some sort of sensor that sends info on the revs to a computer that them sends that info to the tach, but electronic systems like that are way past my knowledge.
Try searching a forum dedicated to GM stuff.If you look at pic you may see tach cannot drop down below 0. There is a molded curve in bezel. Tach needle has to go fully beyond 8k in clockwise rotation to get to where it is now. What might make needle go beyond full circle? Lightening. Strike? Battery short?

 kurtwm1:

I can’t think of a reason why swapping the cluster would cause start or security issues.


In some models, not necessarily this one, the instrument cluster is programmed with the VIN, and must appear on the bus for proper function of the security system.  From time to time, we see posts from people who installed a junkyard cluster, and discovered problems ranging from annoying (odometer reading won’t update, etc) to serious (no start, anti-theft light stays on).
In some models, such as the 1996-2000 Chrysler minivans, the instrument cluster serves as a “hub” for the communication bus, and if defective can result in no start.  There was a problem where cracked solder joints on the circuit board on these clusters resulted in erratic operation or no starting.Took out cluster. Takes 5 min. Lifted up lens and rotated needle to zero, I could feel the stepper motor resistance. Started motor and tach works now. Goes to zero with motor off. Messages still say hot motor. I did unplug temp sensor and forgot to plug it back in. No new messages. Due to missing temp info? Might drive it around today to see if motor gets hot.
I have 2nd equinox but I am not going to borrow.a good  sensor. And get coolant all over.@bcohen2010 has it right. The cluster contains vehicle specific data and swapping it may cause a no start.
I am doing that right now with my Mustang. I am installing a Track App enabled cluster from a year newer car. The security system that identifies the keys will prevent a start. I have software that can program my 2 keys into the new cluster. I will also need to change some other things to enable the Track Apps as well as set the odometer to the correct value. The dealer can do this, too.It’s highly likely the stepper motor for the tach is faulty . . .  don’t be surprised if the problem reoccursWent to store. Used code reader. No codes. Cel light is on. Abs light is on. Tcs light is on. Temp gauge is cold. Message center says motor overheat. Either bad cluster or bcm. But speedo works. Tach works.
It was 90f today. Motor is not overheating.If the bcm and ecm are good would a bad cluster make the ac stay off? Since the cluster is saying motor is hot/ac off? Suv drives fine as is. But I really want ac in July.As for the “a/c is off due to overheat” . . . I have some information that pertains to GM vehicles specifically
If the pcm believes that the coolant temperature is beyond a certain threshold, the ac compressor clutch will be prevented from engaging
Obviously, there are several reasons why the pcm might believe that
We had a few GM vehicles in our fleet . . . not the same as yours, but the same vintage . . . that also had this exact phenomenon
We were able to determine that the engine coolant temperature was well within specs
We were also able to determine . . . with a laser thermometer and ohmmeter . . . that the coolant temperature sensor was working perfectly
Next we simulated specific temperatures with a decade resistance box
And that is where things got interesting
The pcm did not “see” the temperatures we were simulating
Next thing . . . wiring diagram(s)
In the end, we were able to physically see that one of the two pins on the pcm . . . the ones for the engine coolant temperature sensor . . . was physically burnt off of the circuit board
Eventually we found that a certain wire was barely chafed through . . .
And by further looking at the wiring diagram, we were able to determine that particular circuit was unfused, meaning when that wire touched metal or whatever it was . . . it was a little while back . . . something was going to give, and it was the pcm
In the end, the only possibility was live with it . . . and all the warnings . . . or replace the pcm, get it programmed and fix that wire
No offense to anybody, but my gut feeling is it’s not the cluster causing this, as far as this Torrent goes
fyi . . . the GM vehicles in our fleet with the identical problem.  The cluster also read stone cold, while at the same time the message center said engine hot, ac disabledThere are lots of people reporting bad gauges and tachs of this era GM products if you search Google for Torrant gauges cluster.  Somewhere in all that you might find a definitive answer.A bad stepper motor will not cause “engine hot ac disabled”The ecM is on top of battery box. It’s about 1 ft from temp sender. Are you saying the wire harness from ecm to sender has a frayed wire? And the ecm may have a bad component? Can I swap out the ecm for a used one? Same year rig?",,,,

 owen9fn:

Exactly what does that mean?
Does it mean you’ve verified . . . for example with a 12V test light and/or digital multimeter . . . that the fuel pump is getting power?
Or does it mean you assume the pump is getting power?We verified with a multimeter and test light


 owen9fn:

I get power to the connector at the pump but under a load it’s no good


Sounds like you’re going to have use a multimeter to find out where the voltage drop is
Could be bad connections at an intermediate connector, fuel pump relay contacts, etc.
I wouldn’t at all be surprised if the bad connection . . . burnt brittle, for example . . . is inside the fuse box itself.  I’ve seen this a few timesI’ll hunt around for something like that, hopefully it’s not too deep in there. I just talked with some one and they said it could potentially be the ground from the ignition, does that seem like a possibility?I’d be looking at ground G402 as shown in the wiring diagram.
TesterI cut the ground and wired it to a bolt on the frame and… She Runs! Now to just put it all back together.I believe that all you have proved is that the ground is not being established when it should have been.  You need to find out why that is. Otherwise, your pump will not be disconnected from ground when it should.  (Is the ground controlled by computer? (“Tester” obviously understands this better than I do.)That’s what the relay is for. It doesn’t send the power unless it’s asked for. Where it’s grounded shouldn’t matter.I suspect the problem with the ground connection is in the splice pack SP423 as shown in the drawing. Bad connections can seem to be okay until a good load is placed on the line. Using a meter or test light to check for power can fool you at times since they don’t require much current to make them operate. Using something a brake light or head light would help show up a bad connection since they require more current to run them. Like you say, the ground side of the circuit is tied to ground at all times. The FP relay controls the ‘hot’ or power side of the circuit in order to turn the pump on or off.",,,,

Do you have an extra-cost warranty in addition to the carmaker’s standard warranty?I dont have a extra cost warranty in addition to the standard warranty… I was looking online at the 2016 Ford generic manual (below) and it seems to imply that the warranty would be void but it says light truck… F250 is not a light truck. I’m hoping to get a definitive answer…
You may have some implied warranties. For example, you may have an
implied warranty of merchantability (that the car or light truck is
reasonably fit for the general purpose for which it was sold) or an
implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose (that the car or
light truck is suitable for your special purposes), if a special purpose
was specifically disclosed to Ford itself not merely to the dealer
before your purchase, and Ford itself not just the dealer told you the
vehicle would be suitable for that purpose.
These implied warranties are limited, to the extent allowed by law, to
the time period covered by the written warranties, or to the applicable
time period provided by state law, whichever period is shorter.
These implied warranties do not apply at all if you use your vehicle
for business or commercial purposes. In addition, the implied warranty
of fitness for a particular purpose does not apply if your vehicle is
used for racing, even if the vehicle is equipped for racing.Ford expects you to use your truck like that.
Ford Trucks - Built Ford Tough - Built Ford Proud
TesterThis says the implied warranty does not apply if the vehicle is used for business or commercial purposes. You want to read the actual written warranty and see if it applies to your usage.That’s my issue… the actual warranty says the 2016 f250 diesel has a 5 year 100,000 mile drivetrain warranty it doesn’t state any exceptions  until I read further about the implied warranty which gave me some concern. I may need to wait till Monday and just call Ford and ask them directly.I cannot imagine that the powertrain warranty would not cover commercial use of a vehicle which was made and sold specifically for use by contractors and tradesmen.  This is a full-size pickup, with a diesel engine nonetheless, and was clearly intended for precisely the type of use which the OP is using it for.  The phrase “implied warranty” deals more with things like appearance, fit-and-finish issues, etc.Yeah, that was my though too, but I have this underlying doubt based on what I’m reading. It sure doesnt make sense that the warranty wouldn’t be in play but…It clearly states the power train warrant. That is not implied, it is explicit. IMO, you are covered. Why do you want to know?


 mikegordon1969_171627:

the actual warranty says the 2016 f250 diesel has a 5 year 100,000 mile drivetrain


That is 5 years or 100000 miles . You may be close to the 5 year mark so if you have a problem just go to the dealer and if it is covered fine , if not you were going to pay for it anyway.Yeah, I’m having some problems that has caused me to start checking the drivetrain warranty. I read this on motor1.com 1 admittedly it says car but the complete article states fords basic warranty.
Of special note, if you use a new car for ride sharing services such as Uber or Lyft, that’s considered “commercial use” and is not covered by the warranty. This is also usually the case with other carmakers’ warranties as well as third-party warranties.

There is a big difference between using a Honda Civic (for example) for commercial purposes, and using a work truck for commercial purposes.  I have worked in heating and air conditioning now for 16 years, and while most of the companies I worked for chose to buy used trucks–typically at an auction, some did buy new trucks.

863,Scion XB 2006 sometimes won’t start,Maintenance/Repairs,8,8.2k,"We have a 2006 Scion XB. Lately, with the warmer weather, it won’t start. It’s happened twice this week, we were simply drinking around, stopped for a beverage and when we went to start the car, it wouldn’t start, no click or anything. The battery was fine, it was still able to supply power.
We got it towed to the mechanic, who looked at it the next day and it started fine. They kept it all day, even letting it run for half hour, then cutting it off. It still started up fine.
The mechanic checked the battery, starter and alternator and relays, they all checked out fine.
Today we picked up the car, it started fine. Drove it about two miles to an appointment, were inside for about 2hours while it sat outside in the sun. We go to leave and it won’t start. Again, the electrical power was fine, windows and radio worked, but the car won’t start, not even a click on the starter.
Any ideas?If the vehicle has an automatic transmission,try shifting the transmission into neutral and then try starting the engine.
If the engine starts, the problem is with the park/neutral/transmission range switch.

TesterNope, that didn’t fix it, same problem, car won’t start.
The only common thread I can see is that its warmer out these days and the car seems to not want to start after driving around town on these warmer days.Toyota starters are known for wearing out their starter solenoid contacts after 10 years or so. This causes an intermittent no-start situation. Happened to me, fixed it with new contacts I bought at the dealer.Battery connections are the first place to begin when you have a “No Crank” situation. Even
if you have a new battery, if the connections are loose, dirty or corroded, you will not be
allowing the full flow of current to pass thru the connections. The connection may be
enough to turn on the lights, but not enough for the huge flow that is needed to operate the
starter. This is where many people say that they know the battery is good….”because the
lights come on”. This is no more a battery test than licking a 9volt battery. It only tells you that there is electricity…not how many volts or the amperage that flows from the battery.
Jump starting may have wiggled the terminal just enough to allow the current to pass and start the engine, but tomorrow you have the same problem.
First remove the cables from the battery and use a wire brush to remove any corrosion and dirt from the battery posts and the cable terminals. There is a tool with a round wire brush for this purpose, found at any auto parts store for less than $10 http://shop.advanceautoparts.com/p/kd-tools-terminal-battery-brush-kdt201/25980576-P?searchTerm=terminal+brush 11.
Before connecting the cables, apply a coating of di-electric grease to the battery posts this will keep oxygen away from the connection so that it will not corrode as fast.
It is just as important that the other end of the cables also have a clean connection. Remove the positive cable from the battery again so that you do not short anything out. Follow both cables to their far ends, remove this connection and wire brush the connection and the cable terminal clean and retighten these connections.
If there was work done recently, there may have been an “engine to body” ground that was not installed following the work. These grounds normally run from the rear of the engine to the firewall and are uninsulated and most are a braided wire. If any of these are found unattached…reattach them.
Remember….this is not a “Sherman Tank” don’t over tighten the connections.
Tight…tight………………too tight…broke!!!
YosemiteYou have what mechanics call a “no crank” problem.  I’ve battled no-cranks on my Corolla over the years, but never had exactly the problem you have. On my Corolla the problem was that I’d hear the starter click, but it wouldn’t crank the engine.   And it would only happen if the engine was cold and the weather was cold.   There’s a half dozen things that can cause that, most likely is the starter motor itself.
But I don’t think that is the problem you have.  First, it happens to you when it is hot outside.  And  the key symptom you have is you don’t hear anything when you turn the key to “start”.  That means the start signal is probably not reaching the starter motor.  Your shop can verify that with a volt meter.
There’s two likely culprits, the ignition switch, or the transmission safety switch.  You could try wiggling the key a little, and jiggling the transmission shifter a little, see if that helps.   Even if it does, you’ll need the defective part replaced soon.  Otherwise you’ll end up stranded.   Any good inde shop should be able to trace it out for you.Hi, Im also having the same issue, but i believe this is happening to me when its cold outside. I have replaced the Battery, terminal, relay starter, starter, water pump, serpentine belt, sparks plugs, and coil pack. I was going to replaced the alternator, but i got it tested and it was good. Ive taken it to Toyota and they were unable to find any issue with my car since i dont have a check engine light. I would love to get a new car, but im unable to afford for a car now, so this issue is so frustrating.Same problem and I’m so frustrated!!!  I have a 2006 Scion XA with low miles (only about 30,000) and it periodically and inexplicably just doesn’t start sometimes.  Usually it’s only like once a quarter that it doesn’t start.  The first time it happened I got the car towed to a mechanic they looked around and found no problem.  Then he just randomly tried it again and it cranked up.  The mechanic literally had no explanation and I just drove the car home.
The next time it didn’t start was for like another three months.  This time I left the car alone and tried it again about eight hours later and magically it started.  It’s always like this it won’t start and then when I try it the next day it does start.
The weather seems to have no correlation to whether it starts or not.  It’s just very random no rhyme no reason it’s not the battery it’s not the starter so just thoroughly confused and pissed off honestly.

864,New to winter driving,General Discussion,56,1.3k,"Good afternoon all.
I am relocating from the sunny, sunny, sunny south US where even the rumor of a dusting of snow shuts down entire cities to not-quite-over-the-border to the Great White North, where I am reading of requirements for snow chains, and it’s not at all difficult to find all sorts of warnings about doing them wrong can destroy one’s vehicle.
More specifically, I’ll be migrating from Texas to Oregon, by the south-and-west route (I-10 to I-5, then northwards) and the calendar looks like this will be happening during winter.  After the move, I anticipate very low driving needs.
I have a 2013 Chevy Equinox (new to me).  From what I read of Oregon, there are requirements for snow-capable tires or chains for part of the year.  On the other hand, my owner’s manual says not to use chains due to clearance issues.
My current plan is to install winter tires on the car (Bridgestone Blizzak WS90, thanks consumer reports).  Will these suffice?  Or do I need to also carry some sort of add-on device?  And if so, is there something that is clearly “ok” for this vehicle?
Thanks in advance.Can you be more specific about where you’ll be living and driving? Although I’m not personally familiar with the state, I’d actually suspect that most people in areas such as Portland just use all-season tires.
If you’re considering installing the winter tires while you’re still in Texas, keep in mind that they’ll wear very quickly in temperatures around 60 degrees and above.Agreed that we need more information regarding the city you’re moving to. Typically the requirement to carry chains is only over mountain passes. Those are on the south end of I-5 or on several major roads that go east from I-5.If you on the Coast of Oregon, then you probably don’t need snow tires. The coast mainly gets rain.
Chains are not needed unless you’re traveling in the mountains (a lot).
Seattle and Portland average less then 10"" of snow a year…That’s  NOTHING.
Snow tires are probably not required. Good all season tires should be fine. My wife’s cars have had nothing but all-season tires here in NH for the past 40 years…and she’s never had a problem. Our annual snowfall is 5 times what Seattle or Portland average.
Wait til you move there and talk to other people.
The biggest thing in driving in snow is KNOWING how to drive in snow. The biggest advice I give new snow drivers is - SLOW DOWN. Let me repeat - SLOW DOWN. In snow and ice you don’t have the traction for maneuvering and stopping that you on dry pavement or even wet pavement. Keep longer distances between you and other cars. Did I mention -  SLOW DOWN.Thanks for the feedback.  Portland is the destination, and I intend to make use of the city’s excellent mass transit system; right now I’m focused on the getting there part of it because I’m expecting that to happen during the middle of winter.MikeInNH,
Thanks, but “wait til you move there” isn’t the problem - the problem I’m trying to prevent is having some sort of incident during the big drive because I didn’t prepare for winter driving correctly.I would recommend going the southern route and head up the coast, skip mountain roads where chains etc. may be required.The problem on I-5 looks like it might be here:

Siskiyou Summit 2
Siskiyou Summit (also Siskiyou Mtn. Summit; also referred to as Siskiyou Pass) is a summit (high point) on Interstate 5 (I-5) in the U.S. state of Oregon. It is distinct from Siskiyou Pass, which is a nearby, historical mountain pass. Siskiyou Summit is situated in the Siskiyou Mountains, approximately 4 miles (6.4 km) north of the California border. At 4,310 feet (1,310 m), it is the highest point on Interstate 5.  When the highway was rebuilt on its current alignment, road cutting l The Siskiyo...

Then watch the weather channel on the days you’ll be traveling. That’s easy. Don’t drive when the weather is bad. It’s a lot more difficult to do that when you live there.

To get any farther south than Interstate 10 you would have to be in Mexico.My advice would be to fly there and have the car shipped.Your Equinox is front wheel drive ( Unless you have All Wheel Drive ) so if your all season tires are in good shape you really have nothing to worry about  . And if it gets bad enough that you should not be on the road then you should stop no matter what kind of tires you have.
I have driven in some really bad snow storms and front wheel drive has been good enough with good tires.

Keep in mind that if winter conditions when you are driving north on I-5 have it heavily snowed you can divert to the main coastal highway 101, which is unlikely to have snow, at any point in CA and/or OR up to Portland.
It is two lane much of the way and winding and even quite twisting in places.  So it is much slower driving than on interstates.  However, heavily snowed interstates will also be slow going.
If anyone familiar with coastal hwy 101 knows differently/more, please correct my statements!!!  I’ve driven only parts of it in late summer twice thirty years ago.Won’t be any snow on 101 in my estimation. None that would require snow tires in a worst case scenario. If route 40W is too cold (7,000’ elev.) route 10W is probably good.Oregon’s chain law seems a little confusing.
4 or all wheel drive vehicles under 6500 lb are exempt, but must carry chains?
What do they do about vehicles with owners manuals that say they can’t be fitted with chains?
I think they have these laws because most driver from Southern California no nothing about driving in snow.  They think driving in rain is dangerous.
Case in point; My wife
s nephew who grew up in LA was going over the mountains to Bend Oregon. He was stopped and forced to buy tire chains. and had to pay to have them mounted.  He told me it was a good thing he had them because he barely made it through slipping and sliding all the way.
He was driving an early Mazda MPV van and what neither he nor the guy that put his chains on knew that they were rear wheel drive, because the chains were put ON THE FRONT WHEELS.


 oldtimer_11:

What do they do about vehicles with owners manuals that say they can’t be fitted with chains?


Then they can’t drive, When the sign says ""ALL VEHICLES MUST USE CHAINS""
Northern Cal. and southern Ore. have check points in the winter time, no chains you turn around.
If you can’t chain up for any reason, you don’t go.I remember visiting Eugene Oregon in mid February when the roads in the Mid Atlantic were literally covered with ice and on arrival in Oregon the weather was wet, relatively warm and the dandelions were blossoming.
If you stick to the Coastal route  you’ll hit nothing but rain, lots of rain.


 Beancounter:

If you stick to the Coastal route you’ll hit nothing but rain, lots of rain.


And wind, fog, road closures with no detours because of mud and rock slides.
But most importantly, It will be Big Foot mating season, so don’t get out of the car.Watch the 10 day weather for the route and choose to leave when it looks warmest and clearest. Weather projections are typically good for up to 5 days in advance unless you travel along the edge of the weather system. You can always spend the night one or two extra days until the roads are passable again. You have to spend the night several days since you will travel about 2000 miles. Don’t hurry and get yourself into a dangerous situation. Use the tires on the Equinox now unless they need replacement.",,,,
865,Quality of Monroe vs. Gabriel vs. other shock absorbers?,Maintenance/Repairs,16,161k,"My 2006 Ford Focus has 127,000 miles. It has been in need of struts/shock absorbers for a while.
I am looking for something a little firmer than the original equipment but not so much firmer. The most common brands on the market are Monroe and Gabriel. I have had experience with gas-charged Monroes (never tried Gabriels) about 25 years ago. I remember them to be not so impressive.
I am also looking at the baseline model KYB, which seem a little more expensive than the two common brands.
Has any of you had experience with Monroe, Gabriel, KYB or other brands in terms of their firmness and their dirability?I’ve had experience with all brands of struts/shocks over the years.
And what I find is, that the replacement aftermarket struts/shock out-perform the original components.
So, just installing aftermarket components can improve the overall handling of the vehicle.
TesterLooking at what’s listed on Rockauto, I might go with the KYB shocks/struts. They list a kit which also has the springs pre mounted, a big plus.Of the aftermarket shocks and struts, I’ve personally had cars with Monroe, Gabriel and Tokico
Monroe and Gabriel seemed about equal, nothing to brag about
Tokico seemed very stiff, and they didn’t last long.  Less than 10K miles.  I threw them in the metal bin and went with Monroe, until I got rid of the car a few years later
I agree with @texases . . . go with the struts that are already pre-assembled
Afterwards, get a steering alignmentWhich brand offers the better warranty?
Every time some shyster mechanic tells me my car needs new struts, I say, “Cool, my Monroe struts have a lifetime warranty on the parts.  How much are you going to charge for labor?”
What I usually get in response is something like, “Oh, they’re not malfunctioning, I just thought they were the original struts, and that’s why I recommended changing them.”
It’s always I sign that I’ve gone to a crooked repair shop.Gabriel and Monroe parts WILL be stiffer than factory simply because they design them so you can feel that you actually changed something. KYB’s, too. All aftermarket shocks and struts are built that way.
I have used KYB’s and they ride well and are a quality product. Many are built in the US. I currently have Tokico adjustable struts/shocks on my Mustang with well over 10,000 miles and I am impressed. I have also used Gabriels.  They gave me no issues but they were not stiff enough to settle my Ford van’s bobbing nose. The Sachs rear replacement shocks on the wife’s car have 80,000 mile with no issues.
BTW, I was an engineer for a former GM division that made shocks and I’ve cut apart many brands of shocks and struts to see what is inside. Monroe is a bottom feeder especially their aftermarket replacement parts, Gabriel is a bit better, KYB, Showa and Boge/Sachs (now TRW) are better yet. All are OEM suppliers. Premium suppliers would be Koni or Bilstein.I’ve never had good luck with Monroe truck shocks. They never failed, but after a couple years they became real still.
Blistien and KYB are my choice.  Never had an issue with them - even after a couple hundred thousand miles.I’ve heard a lot of dissatisfaction with Monroes. I use KYBs because they’re OEM to Toyota.
By the way, I  think you’ll find your ride a lot firmer with new dampers no matter what reputable brand you use. New dampers make a big difference.Out here in pickup country, I’ve always liked the fat white Gabriels best.
Each brand makes different grades of shocks so it’d be likely to be comparing apples to oranges if you get the light duty of one brand and the heavy of the other.
So it’s be Gabriel Ultra vs Monroe Sensa-Trac for your car.
Since my pickup experience leans Gabriel. . . that’s what I’d buy for a car.Thank you very much, guys.
I am leaning toward KYBs. My Focus is the SES trim, which has the 16-inch wheels, rather than 14 or 15. So, I think I want something a little firmer.If your current dampers are shot, new dampers will definitely firm your ride up. They can make a surprising difference. And I’m alluding to OEM replacements.
Make sure you replace the rubbery bits too, the seat springs, bumper stops, strut mounts, and boots if your struts have them. They’re dirt cheap to buy, and the spring seats and strut mounts make a big difference in the ride, handling, and road noise.
If you want to noticeably improve your steering response, reduce body roll, and reduce sensitivity to wind, without adversely affecting your ride, allow me to suggest you look for some upgraded sway bars. Note that reduced body roll keeps the tires in better contact with the road during turns, and this alone makes a noticeable difference.
Again, be sure you get new bushings with them (they usually come with the bar(s). New sway bar links on a ten year old car may or may not be needed, but check yours to be sure they’re not frozen or worn loose. IMHO upgraded sway bars might be the best suspension upgrade you can make for a daily driver.Hey, Saturn outlook owner here. How can I figure out whether I should use OEM or KYB mounts?
The OEM mount and bearing fits together tightly, but the KYB
has a bit of slack between the mount bearing. I’m not
even sure if the old one needs replacing. The chrome plating is worn
on the Gabriel struts I bought in one egg shaped place
on the rod, and I was hearing clunking and squawking
when I hit bumps.This tread is more than 1 year oldIt’s a legitimate question, so the age of the thread is not too important.  The question is unclear because I can’t tell what the poster wants to do?  Is he changing the mounts, but not the struts?  Or both?Jason,  You will get much better answers/advice by starting your own thread and by actually asking clear questions. The only thing I have to offer is, my experience with Monroe Quick Struts. I Bought 4 for a 99 Camry 3 of them did not have the bearing/mount on correctly, resulting in lots of noise while driving. I somewhat blame myself for not checking them well, just a quick visual. So basically had to remove them re-do the bearing attachment and re-install. Some lessons are learned the hard way.If you can go with Bilstein that will be your best bet in my opinion. They will outperform and handle way better than stock and give you a smoother ride at the same time on most vehicles. My second choice would be KYB. Summitracing.com 20 normally has both those brands in stock for the lowest price most of the time. Sometimes you can find a set of all four on eBay for a little bit less. If you can get a kit with new springs and strut mounts they cost a little bit more but they make it very easy to install. I like both those brands because they make the vehicle feel more planted while giving you better performance and handling at the same time with a smoother ride. On top of not having to adjust them to get the stiffness you want. Gabriel and Monroe seem to be OEM quality or less most of the time. They might come with a lifetime warranty, but Bilstein and KYB I think will last longer in most cases.An old thread but if its a DIY project and if a complete EZ strut kit is available, I’d make that the priority over the brand.

868,Potential problems with buying used 1991 Jeep Cherokee,Buying/Selling,11,569,"I’m looking to buy an XJ cherokee, and I’ve found a 1991 Jeep Cherokee Limited (4.0L V6) and I’d love some advice, especially from the Jeep people. The post had been up for 8 months already, so I’m not going to be offering the full $1200 he’s asking for it. It hasn’t been registered in 4 years, it needs a battery, the drivers window, and the new muffler welded on. The ad says he got it as a hunting rig, did some work to it, like spark plugs, thermostat, etc, and it runs great but he doesn’t have time to fix it and just wants to get rid of it. I plan to use my toyota corolla battery to start and test drive it because the amperage (CCA) is about the same as most batteries for the cherokee. He said I can drive it around the property to test that the 4x4 works, but theres not enough room to get up to speed to make sure that the transmision goes through all gears and there’s no death wobble. I’m curious if these '91 XJ cherokees are known for automatic transmission failures, and if there is anything else I should watch out for besides electrical issues. It only has 125,000 miles, and the interior looks great, but the outside is faded and missing both bumpers. The front bumper seems to have been replaced by two beams welded to the frame and sticking out like a weapon. I’m also wondering what the cost of renewing the 4 year old registration might be in California. Thanks in advance! Take it easyIn all honesty, this sounds like a money pit to me. There’s a reason it’s been listed for 8 months already.
I’d run away from this one, myself.A 30 year old Jeep that hasn’t been driven in 4 years, if he pays you to take it away, you’re still on the losing end of the deal.



 RedRunner:

I’m also wondering what the cost of renewing the 4 year old registration might be in California.


Before you can even register it, It will have to pass a pollution test and a safety inspection, there’s a reason it hasn’t been registered in 4 years.
I wouldn’t even go look at it.At 1200.00 this thing is over priced by 1500.00 .
And how would anyone but the DMV know what the registration penalties are ?I was a big fan of the Cherokees beginning with the '90 model I bought in 1992 that my family drove 190,000 miles on top of the 90,000 on it when purchased. I’ve owned several since then but despite my familiarity and appreciation of those vehicles I wouldn’t buy another one as they are very expensive to keep repaired once they begin to decline. If you price a transmission repair and calculate the likelihood of a 30 year old unit failing the dazzle of their grand reputation will fade fast.
And for the record the 4.0 was an inline 6, not a V-6. For the PURISTs that a critical distinction.This might (MIGHT) be a fun project for someone with the time, money (thousands), and expertise to fix up all the problems that have accumulated in the last 29 years.  But the OP isn’t that kind of person, I’m guessing.Too many downsides.
Eight months listed and no takers yet.
Replaced the thermostat and says no room to get to speed could mean the engine has been fried.
Four years of non-registration could mean he discovered he bought a pig in a poke and threw in the towel.
Regarding the transmission, age is also a factor as internal seals are now 30 years old.
I suspect the guy may know more than he’s letting on; which is not uncommon at all. To me, it’s a 500 dollar rig and I’d have to think long and hard before even going that much on it.If it was GIVEN to you, you should still turn it down.
You will avoid a bottomless money  pit and frequent problems as they arise.
I have given away 3 such vehicles to handy relatives as project cars  with and “as is” condition warranty.If you lived anywhere else but California, I’d say to make an offer of $400-500.  Unfortunately, you live in the one state which will require YOU to pay all of the back registration fees and penalties from when the last registration expired until the time when you attempt to register it in your name.  That could easily be $1000 or more.  RUN, don’t walk away from this “deal”!I’m also curious if all the emissions gear has been removed.  A California cat is more expensive, along with who know what else.  They just had a 'Wheeler Dealers"" where they brought a Nissan 300ZX back in CA emissions spec after it had a lot of aftermarket stuff added.  They had to pull the engine/transmission and replace lots of parts.  Fun to watch, but boy that was a lot of work.This smells like a very iffy proposition and I feel the others have already said what you need to know, but will add my 2 cents anyway…  If you’ve decided it’s a turkey (and it is), no need to read farther.
Unless your’e buying a vehicle just for parts (meaning you’re only paying for parts you can see are good, maybe a door or a headlight housing but not the driveline) and never intend to register it (and are certain of CA DMV rules concerning such sales),  you should always have a vehicle evaluated by a competent mechanic which in this case might mean a flat bed tow to a shop located where it can be driven at speed off the highway, maybe at a speedway or abandoned airport.  Be sure to check for frame straightness, properly (might involve a body shop) - even bent and straightened cars sometimes can measure correctly but still handle weird and wear tires unevenly.  I think a wise person would move on.You didn’t mention tires but that wont be your biggest problem. Any car battery will crank it. Acquaintence bought a bargain vintage Cherokee for his granddaughter. Looked great, ran great. Just needed reupholstering. About a year later I saw his granddaughter driving a different car and I asked him what happened to the Jeep? He said after a few months it started cutting off intermittantly  and the dealer told him that it needed a new computer and programming for $4000.",,,,
869,New rear drum brake Grinding,Maintenance/Repairs,3,163,"First time using a form like this but by now I’m desperate. Still too stubborn to give up though. I replaced both rear drum brakes on my 07 Taurus (FWD), the old drums were a royal pain to get off, bent up the backing plate a bit, that’s been fixed I believe. Put the new brakes on, lots of pictures and double checking, they’re on right. Get going, there is a rhythmic grinding, it seems at random but I’m not really sure yet. I get the thing back in the air take a look, I straighten out the backing plate a bit more, still does it. The wheels have noticable resistance to spinning when it’s in the air, again rhythmically. First and foremost, is it dangerous to drive on? Second, will it fix over time or did I screw something up that needs fixing?There’s something obviously wrong and no one can tell you if it’s safe without seeing it. If you fought that hard getting the drum off, there’s probably a good size ridge on the drum. This should be turned off or replace the drum. If the hardware is installed and lubed properly you should be able to see if it’s rubbing on the outside of the drum. If you know it’s not on the outside, then it’s on the inside, probably the ridge.It sounds like your drum is out of round.The friction surface on new brake drums are not polished, you may hear a mild rubbing sound, especially if you adjusted the brake shoes too tight. The rhythmic nature may indicate that there is run-out in the drum, it may or may not be excessive.",,,,

I noticed a rattling noise (like marbles) coming from the engine upon startup in the morning only. The noise goes away after a few seconds. To me it sounds like bearings rattling due to low oil pressure, but the dealer says that every Outback and Legacy does this. It has a timing chain and the engines use 0-20 synthetic oil. Is this normal.

Is it normal. 
Well yes and no 
Its going to happen because Subaru screwed up. 
They have the oil filter at the top of the motor and its upside down. This allows the oil to drain out over a period of time. 
Then on startup the oil pump has t…
              
Go back to the dealer, and ask to start another 2017 Outback to listen if it makes the same noise.
If it does, then it’s normal.
If it doesn’t, then it’s not normal.
TesterWithout being able to hear it ourselves…I would recommend making another appointment with a different Subaru dealership. Because you are under warranty, it would cost you nothing to make an appointment with another dealership and get another opinion.
YosemiteWhy didn’t I think of that!  I will do that. Thanks for the common sense solution.Thanks. I will do that if things don’t work out when I go back to the dealer from which I purchased the car…Just for kicks check the oil level before you go anywhere.I have a 2014 Legacy with the 2.5 engine, timing chain and 0w20 oil.  It has never rattled on start up.  It should be a simple fix, the dealer should just put on a new oil filter and top off the oil.
BTW, for the time being, use only Subaru oil filters on this engine.  Because of the 0w20 oil, the oil bypass valve in the filter is set for a lower pressure difference than engines that use 5w30 oil.  It can’t afford for the oil pressure to drop as much.I called the service manger at the Subaru dealer where I purchased the car, and he told me that the rattle upon start up was normal (due to the boxster engine design) , and that no harm is being done. He did say that it was low oil pressure caused by the car sitting for an extended period ( 8 hours or so). The noise is caused by the timing chain and tensioner and I presume the 0-20W synthetic oil that it uses. I will say that I am still a bit nervous. In my experience (I had an import auto parts business for 25 years) such a noise upon start up has never been a good thing. My brother who has owned auto repair shops and raced everything from Formula V to dirt track stock cars agrees. I will monitor it carefully, and if the “rattle” becomes more pronounced I will give the dealer a call.If Subaru considers this noise to be normal, it’s one of the reasons I never recommend anyone buy a Subaru.
Tester


 johnznot:

he told me that the rattle upon start up was normal (due to the boxster engine design) , and that no harm is being done.


Trust me–it is not normal.
The OP needs to take the car to a dealership whose service manager is cooperative with customers, rather than throwing BS statements around.
Or, perhaps he should place a call to Subaru Customer Service at the corporate level, via the toll-free phone number that can be found in the Owner’s Manual.
Instead of a Subaru dealership, perhaps the OP should take his car to a Porsche dealer, as this must be the only Subaru with an engine from a Porsche!

(Subaru engines are of the “boxer” design.    “Boxster” is a Porsche model.)Next time the Op goes to this dealership…I’d be wearing hip boots…the craps getting pretty deep around there.
This service manager must have used to sell used cars, knows nothing about how an engine even works, and could care less if someone who spent good money…loses it all.
I think that at this point the OP should just call Subaru corporate as @VDCdriver mentioned.
YosemiteI am going to get in touch with Subaru USA. As much as I want to believe the explanation that the service manager gave, logic and experience makes it difficult to do so.@johnznot
""I just purchased a 2017 Outback.""
Please elaborate. How long have you had it? How many miles on it?
I wonder if the problem was ignored by dealer employees and I wonder if was properly prepped.
Document everything. Get it in writing (repair orders, etcetera).
If there is a problem, I’d consider sitting down with the dealer owner/principal and asking/demanding for a do-over. They can give you another new car, in exchange for this one, repair it at their leisure and turn it into a demo. Any taxes or fees would be on them.
CSAI’ve had the car for about 2 weeks, and there’s 130 miles on it. The dealer claims that the “rattle” is normal. The service manager did say that the rattle came from the timing chain and is caused by a lack of lubrication which he said is not damaging to the chain. I would like to believe the dealer, but a lack of lubrication even for a few seconds can cause damage especially over time. I went to another dealer and had a salesman start up an Outback, but there was too much ambient noise for me to be able to hear whether there was a rattle or not. I am going to go again next week with my brother and have him listen with the hood up.Perhaps go to a different Subaru dealer
And then if you still get no satisfaction, ratchet it up with Subaru corporateMy initial thought is that the oil filters anti-drain valve is defective allowing the oil to drain out over night.  A new $7 oil filter should fix that, the dealer should not balk at this.
If the timing chain is rattling, that is NOT OK.  That is a serious problem, but a timing chain rattle should rattle about all the time, not just a few seconds on start up.
The other thing that would cause a rattle at start up would be  defective hydraulic lifter.  I don’t know if Subaru uses hydraulic lifters as the valves are directly actuated by the cam.Discussing any possible reason for the “rattle” with the dealer is not an option as the dealer insists that what is happening is normal. The service manager said that lack of lubrication caused by the car not being operated for an extended period of time (overnight) was the reason for the issue. I’m not familiar with the properties of the oil that the car uses (0-20W synthetic), but I presume that the oil may be draining off of the chains, guides, gears, and tensioners sufficiently enough to be causing the “rattle.” I am going to write Subaru of America a nice letter and see what it has to say. But if anybody happens to be visiting a Subaru dealer, have a salesman start a 2017 Outback up and see if you can a rattle.I’m not really familiar with Subarus, but I’m quite certain the service manager is full of it
If his theory was correct, EVERY single engine with a timing chain out there would be rattling on startup, after sitting overnight
BTW . . . overnight is NOT considered “extended period”
It’s clear the manager is just plain wrong, an idiot, just doesn’t want to deal with you, or one or all of the above
I would not stand for this for one single minute
They are clearly taking advantage of you
I like your idea of writing a letter.  Keep records of everything.  Who you talked to, when, if they returned your calls, etc.  You might have to use it as ammunition soon
Word of advice . . . make that letter a “sign on delivery”
That way they can NOT claim they didn’t receive it


 db4690:

The letter should definitely be sent as Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested.
(I thought that it would be a good idea to use the USPS’s actual terminology.)I believe your service advisor/manager misspoke. Rather than lack of lubrication  the chain could be audible during start-up from the lack of oil pressure, the chain tensioners use oil pressure to apply tension on the chain.

I disagreed and regardless, problem persists.This was my third Lincoln and probably my last. Anyone else with similar complaint?This must be a new rattle, or you would have complained to the dealer 3 years ago. What direction does the rattle come from?  If it comes from the front left, it might be something associated with the driver’s side mirror.
But maybe not. I had a rattle behind the driver and on the passenger side of a van we used to own. I thought it was in the door, but it didn’t happen often. My wife drove the van mostly and never complained. I finally found it while messing around with the roof rack. One of the tie down brackets was loose and rattled occasionally. I tightened it and no more rattle.  Check the roof rack if you have one.I was not that clear re the origin of the noise. We’ve had the noise since we took delivery three years ago. It’s only noticeable when driving at highway speed. My wife drives it most of the time unless we take it on vacation. First took it back to dealer about a month after purchasing following a road trip. They confirmed noise but could not find source and haven’t since. I complain every time I take car in for service so wife usually takes it in now and guess noise does not bother her. Thanks for your suggestionsCheck the mud liners below the car , one of them may be loose and clips missing .loose liners make a hell of flapping noise

Not even going to try if it is hard to hear.Is it still under warranty?I mean it’s noticeable in the video buts it’s literally just a crackling sound like a candy wrapper coming from the passenger side around the glove box.Sadly it’s not under warrantyyou got a Ford Fiesta over 70 MPH??
You’re braver than I…

Check around the glove box.  Is it loose?  Is there paper that stuck up in behind it?  I’m at work and couldn’t watch the video, but that is where I would start.sure sounds air-flow related.
maybe it IS paper ! or a dry leaf , or a loose weatherstrip.
take along a rider  . . or an alternate driver so YOU can listen, follow, investigate, the source.
One common place to start is the cabin air filter and cowl air inlet for debris.All that I could hear is road noise, but I think that Ken Green is probably on the right track.
The OP should check for an accumulation of leaves, paper,  or other foreign objects in the HVAC fan housing.


 ken_green:

Or a loose splash shield or wheelwell liner.Thanks for all the help and suggestions guys. I’ll take the advice and see if I find something.
But yeah it definitely sounds like the noise is inside the car, as if it’s inside the glove box rather than something exterior or way in front off the engine.


 Jorgeurias27:

Well, since the housing for the HVAC fan is directly in back of the glove box, I think that you should definitely investigate the possibility of leaves, paper, or other foreign objects in the HVAC fan housing.It’s not at all hard to hear. I hear it clear as day. My car just started making that noise too. After I stopped and looked under I could hear condensation drips falling on the hot pipe and instantly boiling. To me that’s what it sounded like. I was driving it with the ac off but fan on cold. Did you ever figure out what it was? Is it possible it’s just condensation dripping on hot pipe? I thought it was a bee stuck in the glove compartment, or a wire shorting, but it didn’t really happen while driving slow…",,,,
875,2014 Toyota Camry - Tires cupped,Maintenance/Repairs,5,226,"4 tires are cupped. Tires? Or suspension?
I NEED to makr a 500 mile trip before i replace the tiresI can’t see your tires, so I don’t know.
Why not take it to a shop and ask them?A simple Google question ( why do tires cup ) would have given you the possible cause of cupping.
Such as - worn shocks and struts - tires under inflated - sometimes cheap tires will do that .
Now go out to the vehicle and push down on all 4 corners and if the vehicle bounces more then a couple of times there is your answer.Most likely you need shocks and struts all around. The tires are already gone, they’ll just keep cupping even after the repair, and new tires will do the same thing if you don’t replace the shocks and struts.If no parts of the tread are under the legal limit and if the whole car doesn’t shake noticeably when you drive it, then I suppose you can get away with making this drive first.Here’s what causes tire cupping.

+1
I don’t think that any cars have a “tachometer light”, but all modern cars have a warning light for low tire pressure, and that warning light is frequently displayed in or near the tachometer.
Advice for the OP:

Open the glove box, and take the Owner’s Manual out of the glove box.
Read (at least) the section of the manual that explains the instrument panel displays and the various warning lights.
If this warning light turns out to be the light warning you of low tire pressure, then you need to resolve that situation by inflating the tires (including the spare tire) to the correct pressure.
Purchase a hand-held tire pressure gauge, and get into the habit of checking your tire pressure regularly.

877,Jumpstarting a car - AAA used the negative?,Maintenance/Repairs,17,703,"I have a 2012 Volvo s60 and my car battery died recently, so I tried to jump it myself and had no luck, so had to call AAA.
I’ve always known that rather than hooking the negative to the dead battery, you attach it to an unpainted metal surface (away from the battery). Even looking at the Volvo manual, it has a specific place where it suggests you attach it.
When AAA came out, he originally hooked up the negative to the same spot I did, but when he wasn’t able to jump it that way, he hooked it up to the negative on the dead battery. I tried googling and everything says this is dangerous and not recommended. So my question is why did he do it and why did this work while the other way didn’t? (I tried asking him, and he gave me some BS answer).
Thanks in advance!RBad battery cables will do this.There was a poor connection at the negative jump start location.
Using the battery terminals worked and there was no explosion.Old fart here, done it so many ways and no problem. If you are looking for a reason to blame AAA I don’t think you have a case.If you look under the hood of your vehicle, here’s what you see.
image750×422 102 KB
A lot of plastic and not much metal.
If I were a AAA tech, and connecting to the normal ground didn’t work, I’d connect to the battery.
I’m there to get your car started.
Not diagnose it.
TesterAAA sends out the tow company they have a contract with, and i’d suspect your’s was not the only jump start call they had to respond to that day.Done it that way many times, never had an explosion or a battery case crack.I was jumping cars for 30 years before I first heard the recommendation to place the ground cable away from the battery.  I say the ground cable because back then there were a lot of positive ground vehicles around.
When jumping a positive ground vehicle, I would unhook both of my battery cables, you had to use both battery posts then.You have two grounds in your vehicle, an engine ground and a chassis ground.  There are one or more straps that connect the engine ground to the chassis ground so that both are at the same potential.
If you were connecting the negative jumper cable to a chassis ground and the the ground strap(s) were corroded/broken or otherwise not very conductive, you would have a high resistance in the loop that includes the starter and battery.  This would reduce the voltage and current available to start your vehicle.
It should have started if your negative jumper cable was connected directly to the engine block or head.  That is where the starter is grounded.Usually the tow truck guys are using portable jump packs. They hook up the cables, then turn the pack on. So there’s very little chance of sparks because there isn’t any circuit to arc from. Sparking is what you’re worried about when hooking to the negative terminal because it might ignite outgassed hydrogen from the battery.
The reason you don’t want to do this with a normal jump start is that you’re hooking the cables up to another car’s battery, and that doesn’t have an off switch, so you will get a little spark when you make that final connection.It’s a low probability event with extreme consequences, like playing Russian roulette with a 1000 chambered revolver.  It doesn’t happen often, but when it does you don’t want to be near it.
Sparks made when completing the circuit at the battery can ignite hydrogen produced by the battery and flames propagate back through the vents to ignite hydrogen inside the battery, building pressure and producing a bomb with sulfuric acid and chunks of battery flying everywhere - one would be lucky to survive it with out eye or other serious damage.  In ~ 7 decades I’ve experienced this once (it also happened to a friend’s son who related it on “Car Talk”) and I have no interest in a repeat.   If you really feel compelled to make the final connection at the battery, first remove the vents, fan away fumes for a minute or so, and cover the top of the battery closely with a wet rag (to serve as a flame arrestor) before making the last connection.  However a damaged battery, such as one whose case cracked due to freezing after headlights were left on overnight,  can spark internally in which case the wet rag won’t help (this is why mine exploded, fortunately it happened while driving the car after jumping, acid everywhere).
In ignorance I connected both cables at the battery for several decades w/o event and I suspect a combination of ignorance, arrogance, and “it’s always worked for me” might explain why professionals sometimes do it - but it’s never wise.I’ve never understood the reason for so much caution. A battery that needs a jump isn’t outgassing at the moment the cable is attached to the negative post. Is it because there’s a spark when you disconnect?Jumpstarting instructions are long and complicated and seem overly cautious, and what Ken said is what everyone with a cold winter needs to pay attention to: If it’s below freezing and your battery’s been dead overnight, the electrolyte might be frozen so when you jump it the battery explodes.
In warm weather there’s very little risk in jumpstarting.Couple of reasons. Sometimes people assume the battery is dead and jump it when the problem is elsewhere. And there’s a difference between a completely dead battery and one that is discharged just enough to be unable to start the car.
The “avoid sparking near the battery” thing is for a low-odds, high-consequence scenario. Kind of like how we wear our seat belts every time we drive. I haven’t had a wreck in 20 years, so statistically I should stop bothering. But that would be dumb because if I do manage to beat the odds, not wearing a seatbelt is going to hurt, a lot.
I was actually thinking about these low-odds safety measures yesterday when I was reading a technical description of a fighter jet ejection seat. Don’t judge, I’m a nerd. Those ejection systems are very expensive, and taken against the total number of hours ever flown in fighter jets, almost never used. From a cost perspective, a purely statistical analysis would suggest that it might not be worth the expense of putting them in. But they sure are nice when they’re needed.


 Lee_T:

I’ve never understood the reason for so much caution.


You would if you knew someone who had a battery explode when attaching the jumper cables . It took a trip to the emergency room and fortunately they did not lose an eye .
Granted the risk is low but being cautious only makes sense .I’m one of those guys that will take the odds when you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.  So in this case, jumping to a remote ground has nothing to lose and everything to gain, even if the likelihood of an explosion are very remote.
But, all the safety literature I’ve seen recommends connecting to the remote ground on the vehicle with the dead battery.   The reason is to be further away from the battery so the spark is less likely to ignite gasses and so you are further away if the battery explodes.
If I want to be further away from a potential explosion, it makes sense to me to make the last connection to a remote ground on the doner rather than the recipient.  That is the way I do it.

Ken wrote:

I fully agree with Ken.
I too jumped car batteries for 30+ years before the recommendation came out to make the last connection to a ground on the vehicle.  Never a problem.
However, I did have a battery blow up in my face shortly after high school.  It was due to a faulty battery charger.  The explosion blew the top of the battery right off, splattered acid all over me, sent plastic shrapnel into my face.  I am so thankful I didn’t lose my eyesight.
I will always seek to make the last connection to a vehicle’s ground, and I always try to wear glasses.  One’s eyesight is too valuable.This the jump pack AAA uses.
There’s an on/off switch so when connecting to the battery, a spark isn’t created.

878,2000 Toyota Camry battery drain,Maintenance/Repairs,27,859,"I have a HIGH amp battery drain.
Over 6 Amps anyway for sure. (Thats the limit of the Voltage and Current controlled power supply I use for charging dead batterys anyway).
Here’s the rub. After disconnecting the negative battery lead, and then charging the battery overnight, I looked at the Power Supply displays, and the battery read 14.2V…Whch is where I set it to lower the current, if the battery was able to charge to that voltage. I connected the negative lead back up. All looked well. Still 14.2 volts, almost zero current draw. Then suddenly, and with no accompanying lights or sound, the power supply started drawing the max of 6 amps, and the voltage dropped to about 13.8 volts. (battery is now connected in parallel with the Power Supply). This went on as I scratched my chin for a minute, then the P.S. went back to 14.2V, 0 amps, and continued to cycle on and off that way every 2 minutes!!! HUH?!

                @ PvtPublic 
I am very happy, (And am orgasmicaly relieved to say) your idea was the one that made the repair happen. The fact that I no longer have the facility’s to take my time and be my normal-thoughtful-trouble-shooting-self on anything electrical, meant that something that did not drain my ful…
              
When you say “no aftermarket anything” it says that you have not completely disconnected the battery when charging.  Do that. It eliminates some variables.I was trying to keep from writing a book.
Yes, I did let the power supply alone run the car. Same deal, too heavy a load to not max out the power supply, 6.8V and 6A, then toggled from that to,  14.2V about 5 mA, about every 2 minutes.
But good point. It is a strong about 2 yr old Interstate Battery, clean contacts, and all cells in the normal zone, electrolyte-wise. This problem happened very suddenly. Something is drawing I’m guessing over 10A, when it happens, cycling 50/50 on-off time at about 2 minutes each state.I am concerned about any of your tests with the power supply in the circuit. A good power supply should have overload protections that might kick in. It could also be interacting with the car’s protection systems.
I don’t think you have clearly told us the symptoms you had when the whole problem started. Charge the battery (when it is completely disconnected), tell us what voltage it has reached, and then tell us what happens when you connect it in the car…ignition off for a couple hours…and measure the voltage then. Then start the car and take measurements. Voltmeters and ammeters, not power supplies.However, as I already mentioned, it is a both Voltage and Current controlled supply. It’s A Lab P.S.
It is a 4 output supply, 2 of which can be placed in serial mode to get to 60 volts @ 3 amps, or in parallel  @  30 Volts 6 Amps. This is done just by selecting it on the front of the unit. So you can short positive to negative in any mode. and it will limit itself to the output currents above.
However I am fully aware that their are others who have more experience working on this specific car, and may have seen this before.  Also, just bouncing ideas back and forth is very conducive to getting ideas on what might be done next to narrow down the problem. I have been repairing cars since I owned my own beater at age 16.  I have almost never brought any car to a shop, friends cars included,
I am very mechanically minded, & have done all my own repair and preventative maintenance work.

My response was:



 hubert275_171399:

This means the car was running just fine, no symptoms until I went to go to the store one evening.
Then the battery was dead enough to not run even a dome light.



 oldnotdeadyet:

I don’t need to let the car sit for a couple hours, the power toggling starts immediately again, with or without the power supply in parallel with the battery. With that high a current draw toggling on and off,
I am not going to let the car sit and kill the battery again, damaging it even further. Last night I just left the supply on the battery at 14.4 Volts, when I looked at it this morning, it was at it’s normal float voltage, 14.4V. You may have noticed I upped the charging voltage to the 14.4 Volt I usually use for lead acid battery’s. The current draw was about 250mA, no load.
When the supply is out of the system completely, and the battery is not connected to anything, it settles to 12.8 Volts. So the battery has not been killed yet, I caught the problem fast enough to keep it healthy.
-HubertTake an infrared thermo gun and point at the fuses as the current draw is occurring.
The fuse that reads hotter than the others is the circuit with the current draw.
TesterNow THERE is a good idea! With that kinda amp draw, something is going to warm up!                      Now I just need to procure one…
Until I do get one, still open to anyone who has had anything similar or other thoughts…
Thanks Tester!Symptom:  your first symptom was that battery was so dead that dome light wasn’t on. That sounds like something that occurred while the car was parked.  I am still asking what the battery does when it sits now…have you measured parasitic drain at key off?
Your second symptom is “power toggling”.  I am not quite sure what you mean by that.  Is it a variable idle speed?
You and I agree that we learn a lot more by diagnosing these things ourselves.  It totally helped me supervise the repairs of some million dollar hospital equipment. (No, I did not do them myself, so nobody got killed.)You should be able to find the fuse circuit with the trouble by removing suspected fused circuits one fuse at a time to see if the problem goes away. Since the ignition is OFF when the trouble happens the trouble should be tied to the fuse panel under the hood. Start with the higher amperage fuses.Searching for a draw based on the charge rate of a battery charger is “tail chasing”.
The amperage draw must be measured in series with the circuit.


 Nevada_545:

Searching for a draw based on the charge rate of a battery charger is “tail chasing”.


I am not trying to diagnose the problem by seeing what the Power Supply is reading.
But it DOES SHOW that the problem is happening when the battery
with the power supply across it initially reads 1/4 Amp, then goes to it’s 6Amp capacity. It simply shows me that the problem is happening, and has the added benefit of keeping the battery charged, especially when the problem is not there, and you can tell it is keeping the battery from draining/ getting damaged.  I may be crazy, but I’m not stupid. ALL testing measured here has been with the car keys not even in the ignition.
FYI: I have put my DVM in series (In 10Amp current mode) with the battery, no charger involved, and it blew the 10Amp fuse in the meter. So after replacing that fuse, I keep the power supply across the battery as a crutch. At least I can see when the problem is occurring without hurting either the meter or supply.


 hubert275_171399:

then the P.S. went back to 14.2V, 0 amps, and continued to cycle on and off that way every 2 minutes


You keep asking questions I have given answers to. And I’m sensing some snark. Give me a ham on rye, hold the snark. I am a Electrical Engineer, and can hold my own in troubleshooting. But often bouncing ideas off others is helpful, (sometimes not I guess) And many times you will find somebody who has had the same problem, and can save you much time. While I need this car fixed, I have another available, so it lessens the pressure/ urgency of completing the job.
The car has one symptom; 1) When the engine is off, I have a battery draining. Clearly the car is fine while running, or at least whatever the problem is, is getting masked by the additional amperage from the working alternator. All the measurements given here were with the keys out of the ignition. Letting the car sit for even a short period will just result in the battery getting further damaged. Unless of course I either A) keep the P.S. on it, or B) disconnect the battery as soon as I get out of the car.
I measured the battery once with the engine running, It was 13 point something volts, and rose when I manually increased the RPM under the hood. Since I know that the charging system is working, I will be doing all my trouble-shooting with the car off.
Tonight I will be borrowing a friends IR Thermometer, and see if I can do some narrowing down with that, first under the hood of the car. With luck that will get me to the Fuse Box inside the car.
(Thanks for that idea @Tester)An “Electrical Engineer” should know the difference between a “Power Supply” that you are using and a “Battery Charger” that you should be using, are not interchangeable.
An “Electrical Engineer” should know that just because an alternator is putting out 13.6 volts, doesn’t mean it’s putting out any amps.I imagine I will be getting to that method if once I get the IR Thermometer, and am still unable to find anything. My concern with the IR Thermometer, the focal point may be too large to be of much value in a crowded fuse box. What would be of real help would be a IR camera. As it is intermittently drawing (I’m guessing here), between 10 and 15 amps,  I should be able to find some heat somewhere there shouldn’t be any! Thanks for the input.@hubert275_171399
Sir, let me state up front that I am not mechanically, electrically, or electronically knowledgeable.  So please ignore me and accept my apology if my comments are irrelevant.
However…your mention of the power drain toggling on and off sounds remarkably like what killed the battery on my cell phone awhile back.  It turned out that a glitch had the phone actively pinging for system and app updates every minute despite being set to check only once a week.
I have no idea what system or onboard computer in a car could possibly be trying to activate anything.  And I realize the idea is almost certainly not relevant.
But it is that consistent, repetitive toggle on and off of a parasitic power draw (if I’ve correctly understood your problem) that sounds so familiar to what killed my cell phone battery.@Marnet
No, your not wrong, the effects are similar, but your right again, in that there is no real relation with the problem my car has. Cell phones are often used as repeaters to extend signals from other’s phones to weaker signal areas.
That kind of thing will definitely shorten your battery’s charge time.@hubert275_171399
Well, it was a wild guess.  I admit I didn’t see how it would apply to cars.  But the symptom and drained battery result seemed familiar so I mentioned it just in crazy chance it had any relevance.
Good luck solving your problem.  I am interested to learn what turns out to be the cause and resolution.@oldnotdeadyet
You would see a square wave riding on a lowering DC level, as the load was alternately draining at around 15Amps, then back to it’s float voltage, (Not draining) at a 50% duty cylce, 2 min draining, 2 min decreasing float voltage.
Just imagine there is a gremlin in the car putting a 1.2 Ohm resistor across the battery every 2 minutes, holding it there for 2 minutes, then releasing it, rinse and repeat.@Marnet
Thanks, and once I’ve found the issue, you will find the answer here!If the draw is to high for your meter, use a 12 light bulb in series with the battery. The higher the draw, the brighter the light. Keep pulling fuses until the light dims considerably. At least then you will find which circuit is the problem. Then you can start narrowing it down.",,,,

It still runs like a top. In fact, on the highway I still get close to 21 or 22 MPG on it. It uses no oil between oil changes. I go about 6 months and maybe 4000 miles between the oil changes.
I do have a question regarding spark plug replacement.
I understand replacing the plugs on this V8 is a very difficult and potentially dangerous job. Is there any reason for me to replace the plugs any time soon? I was planning on doing it at about 100K unless I start noticing a reduction in performance.
What have other Explorer owners of this vintage with the V8 done? I know I have low miles considering the age. If I do need to change the plugs, should I have the dealer do it? Since the plugs are prone to breaking I want someone who has plenty of experience with this. Is there a disadvantage to leaving them in as long as possible? Will they be more difficult to change?
Anyone with a similar vehicle might be able to share what they feel is the best course of action for me. Also, any other maintenance advice would be helpful since I plan on keeping this thing until it dies. It’s not worth much in value now although it has no body rust, nor does it have much of any rust underneath the car.
Thanks.
TomIt’s totally unpredictable what will happen when removing these plugs.

Testerlooks easy on the bench.Yeesh.  I’d want to find a good mechanic experienced with this problem.  That engine has alloy heads, right?After seeing this, I certainly won’t be doing this myself. Gone are the days of the old spark plug socket and ratchet. I could change a set of plugs in a few minutes on most cars back in the late sixties and early seventies on almost any vehicle. I am curious though. How much does this contraption cost?I’m not sure. I haven’t done any real mechanical work in about 40 years.I spent my career working on Supercomputers. Some of the work on those Cray computers was about this difficult if not harder.Here’s the one I use.

Ford Spark Plug Remover Kit, Triton 3V





Prices vary depending on where you purchase it from.
TesterI have experience with one of these engines - a 2007 Mustang 4.6 liter. The plugs tend to get carboned up inside the head and since they are really long, there is lots of area to hold the plug in place. I replaced mine at 50,000 miles and had no issues… BUT
I used Seafoam to clean out the combustion chambers before I attempted a plug removal. I researched a bit and found a few that swore by removing the plugs cold with an impact wrench. I did that and the plugs came out in one piece, no problems. So I didn’t need to buy the tool or have it towed to the dealer. My car, my risk.
Ford has a special procedure they developed for this. Their dealers know this. They also have the tool ready if one breaks. I’d suggest taking it to the dealer and having the plugs changed now.That’s what I’d do, too.  No reason to wait on what could be an expensive issue.  Doing it earlier will reduce the chance of problems.What do the dealers do if they break one? Are they responsible? I am inclined to do it sooner rather than later, but the truck runs perfectly now. I am always hesitant to not leave well enough alone.@Mustangman has good advice.
The plug tip is just a little longer than the hole that it goes in and because a few threads protrude on the cylinder side of the head…they tend to get carboned up.
Then when you remove the plug the carbon tears the threads right out of the head as you remove it.
If you are lucky, the carbon will get sheared off the threads asx you remove the plug. Then you might have enough thread in the head to snug the new plugs.
My nephew has the 4.6 and someone stripped the threads on 4 of the eight plug holes.
I had to install inserts in each one. When the previous owner changed the plugs, there was just enough threads to barely snug the plugs again. Then a few months passed and my nephew started blowing plugs out.
When the plug does blow out…the force tries to push the coil out of the way ,and it tears off the ear that holds the coil down.
So you need to buy new coils for each plug that blows too.
YosemiteI see this is an old thread, but I did my own plug change out on my 07 Explorer 4.6l. Ford mechanic friend of mine said to warm the engine, then remove the coils and spray PB Blaster down the plug holes and let it sit overnight. Then in the morning, when cool, using the socket set, very slowly and gently begin to turn the plugs loose, permitting them to sit after just 1/8 turn or less, and spray PB Blaster again. Let this sit an hour, and then turn the plugs back and forth in this 1/8 turn or so until the plugs begin to loosen. Using this technique I did not break any of the 8 plugs and everything came up clean. I replaced all 8 and coils as well. I’ve had no problems with this since.The one that Lisle makes is 88 bucks at Tooltopia.",,,,
880,2019 Buick Regal - rear end out,Maintenance/Repairs,2,200,"Rear end gone out, out of fluid.That is odd.  Fortunately your warranty should cover it, unless some unscrupulous shop drained it.Or if it was collision damage from running over something.",,,,
881,2014 Subaru Forester rattles at stop lights,Maintenance/Repairs,1,187,"My 2014 Subaru Forester has 93K miles on it. For the past couple months (I don’t drive much these days) I’ve noticed that the car shakes/rattles when I’m stopped at a stoplight. Thoughts on what that is? I found out my very trusted mechanic closed his doors permanently during the pandemic.We can’t feel it or hear it via cyberspace, so anything that any of us tells you is just a possibility.
The rattling noise when the engine is idling could merely be the result of a loose or bent heat shield on the exhaust system.   There are a few of these shields, so any of them could be the source of the rattling.  This is something that is annoying, but is not dangerous.
If the engine is shaking, then I have to wonder whether the Check Engine light is lit up.
Is it?
Because of the H-4 engine design, Subaru’s 4 cylinder engines are normally not subject to the type of vibration that inline 4 cylinder engines are subject to, but if the engine is misfiring, or is otherwise not performing at its optimum, then it is definitely possible for your engine to be shaking at idle speed.
That type of engine problem is not something that should be ignored, and it needs to be diagnosed–in person–by a qualified mechanic.  When seeking a new mechanic, just be sure to avoid Midas, Meineke, Monro, Sears, Pep Boys, AAMCO, and all other chain operations.     Ask friends, neighbors, relatives and co-workers to recommend a competent independent mechanic’s shop.
While the vehicle is in the shop to diagnose the shaking problem, that would also be a good opportunity to have the rattling noise investigated.",,,,
882,"New timing belt, Still won’t start",Maintenance/Repairs,18,453,"My Honda Civic LX (2003) cut off going down the road about a week ago. My dad took it all apart and replaced the timing belt, has everything aligned to the marks and getting spark. Tried starting it and nothing. Before I spend $70 on a crankshaft sensor or any other fixes I’m trying to see if there’s something we’ve done wrong or something we can try. He’s checked to make sure it’s not rotated 180 degrees off. We’re stumped and nothing we can find online is seeming to give any helpful answers. If there’s anything else I can add let me know, it’s my first car and I’m still learning, dads busy with it now.Did you check if any valves are bent?

TesterYes and they’re fineFuel? Try a burst of starter fluid at the intake to the air filter. If it fires up for a moment, there is a fuel delivery problem.
Do you hear the fuel pump run for a couple seconds each time you turn the key from Off to Run (not all the way to Start)?
Is it out of gas?There’s a full tank in it, and he did the starter fluid too. Yes we can hear the fuel pump. It doesn’t start at all, just cranks.The battery is good too, so we’ve ruled that out.Have you checked spark at plug?He just disconnected the throttle body sensor and tried to start it that way to check the timing, still won’t start but it did make a sort of pop sound, he said “almost” and that means the timing is off by a tooth or two. The frustrating part is putting it all together and taking it back apart every time we try to start.Yeah the spark is goodHow were the valves checked? This has an interference engine and this did not happen at idle but at speed going down the road.
You need spark,  compression, fuel pressure, and pulsing fuel injectors to run plus some semblance of timing. Does the starter motor seem to crank the engine over pretty easily?Do a compression testHe says we don’t have a tester, he’s got to borrow one from my cousin to do that. Unless there’s a way to do it without one?IF your dad is a good mechanic changing a timing belt is fairly easy. IF he left no wires unplugged, it should start. As you think nothing else is wrong. Bent valves should result in faster then normal cranking. Which you might hear. But you drive it, not your dad. And you say it cranks normally.Bent valves will have dramatically increased valve lash.
Wiggle the rocker arms of closed valves (cam lobes pointed away).
A bent valve’s rocker will have noticeably more free play.
No tools needed for this other than to remove the valve cover.

Hi Kaitlyn:
Nothing in your post says that the timing belt was indeed broken.  We’re all inferring that it was.  Can you confirm that when your father took it apart that the belt was actually broken.
If it wasn’t, then the diagnosis becomes a little different.


 Cavell:

Do a compression test


This is a good indicator if there was valve damage and/or the belt was put on correctly. It could be 180 degrees off.AZ has compression testers. Unless you’re in Cali.

There are other reasons for a car to stall. This wouldn’t be the first time someone replaced a part because they assumed it was the problem. 
But I’m leaning toward a snapped t-belt and bent valves. Every great once in awhile you’ll break a belt on a Civic and not bend valves, but when that happens you should fix the car and drive it straight to Vegas because you just beat some very long odds. ",,,,

884,2008 Dodge Grand Caravan - All Hazard lights illuminated,Maintenance/Repairs,8,255,"I have a interesting situation.  For the last couple of years intermittently, we would start the van and the windshield wipers would go on by themselves continuously, the headlights would blink on their own, all hazard warning lights were illuminated, and the Tach, gas gage, and speedometer would not work.  We found that opening the drivers side door and closing it would, most times, stop this action.
Fast forward to a week ago.  We took it to a dealer and said fix it.  After reading internet chats, I suggested the door wiring harness might be compromised.  They poo poo’d that idea.  After being in their shop for a few days, it happened to them, they were actually witnessing this intermittent situation.  They troubleshot it to - the door harness.  The car is old enough they said the harness is not available.  So they fixed the harness themselves.  I’m guessing they spliced good wires where the bad wires were.  I don’t know exactly what they did to fix it.
Now a funny situation has emerged.  With a “fixed” harness, all the hazard lights are illuminated.  After troubleshooting this, they say the instrument cluster is bad, to the tune of $800 and 2 weeks.  Does this sound logical?  To me, a good harness should not cause the lights to come on.  They are telling me the cluster was bad for a long time and the bad harness was hiding that.  Well, the cluster worked after we slammed the door a few times, all lights worked appropriately, and everything else worked.
So what they are telling me is that my broken harness allowed the cluster to work properly.  My logic is this:  The times this happened, the harness must have somehow made proper connections and the lights all illuminated on the cluster.  By slamming the door, the harness somehow lost proper connections and the cluster worked perfectly.  That is the logic they want me to swallow.   Does this make any sense to anyone?
On the chat boards, they suggest that improper grounding can cause these indications and one said that tightening grounding lug G300 will fix this problem.  Does this make any sense to anyone?
And finally, if you have ideas or experience with this I would be very interested.  I’m $900 into this already with diagnosing time and harness fixing.  I don’t really want to spend more money.  But they want me to get a new cluster for $800.  I don’t have any confidence in that.
Thanks,
mspartAnd not a word about the TIPM maybe being the problem?



Chrysler Problems



A Wide Range of Electrical Gremlins Can Be Traced to Chrysler's TIPM Problem
If you've heard of a TIPM, chances are you own a vehicle from Fiat-Chrysler (FCA). Think of it like a command center for all the electrical functions of your car, and in FCA's case a very, very disfunctional one.





I’d suspect that before a wiring harness or the instrument cluster,
TesterThank you for responding.  They have supposedly found the TIPM not at fault.  They fixed the harness and did additional troubleshooting where they disconnected the harnesses at the modules that go into the TIPM etc.  When they took off the harness for the instrument cluster they say they found what they were looking for which is why they want to replace it now.
mspartWhen I read about the original problem the first thought that came to my mind was a grounding problem as the cause for the trouble. I guess that is water under the bridge now.
I have to question the diagnosis about the cause of the trouble with the flashers being with the instrument cluster. The only tie to the dash I can see is the lights in the dash that light up when they are used. If I was working on this I would be very curious to know what fuse is suppling power to those lights. Power to the lights should be controlled through the flasher switch, which I assume is OFF. If so, is the normal power getting past the switch somehow or is something else supplying power to the lights after the switch. Pulling fuses to see which one kills the lights should help find the problem. If the cluster really is the cause then how is power getting to the lights. What I really suspect happened is the shop may have mis-wired something when they did the repair work. Though I can’t say that for certain.Cougar,
Thank you for your very detailed response.  I share your suspicion as well.  I just had them tighten a ground and no help.  I am looking for an instrument cluster right now.  If I get it they will put it in, or I will pull the car out and do this at home.
Just to be clear, it was not the flashers that were on and off.  It was the headlights and the wipers.
mspartYou stated that after the “fix” was done the hazard lights are illuminated. If you are stating that those lights are the ones in the dash AND on the outside of the van then I still suggest you follow the previous post. If it is just the lights in the dash that are ON then something a little different is going on I guess. In that case I would still be interested to know what fuse kills the lights. I still suspect something they did performing the previous repair work is causing the “new” issue. But I could be way off base here.
If there was a ground problem before then that is has been cleared. Somehow power is getting to those lights and that path needs to found in my opinion. Checking the fuse lines is the easiest way to find out that answer.They are telling me it is a can-bus issue.  One module not talking on the bus like it should.  In this case, the instrument cluster module.   But that is the module with the lights illuminated.  I agree with you, I think they did something and want me to pay for it.  I don’t think it is malicious, I just don’t think they know what they are doing.So the lights that are on are controlled by a module that uses the CAN-BUS? Are outside lights on also?I’m told the head lights and the wipers are no longer actuating on their own.",,,,
885,2013 Fiat 500 - Lost acceleration,Maintenance/Repairs,8,339,"My car suddenly lost acceleration while driving around 60 mph, I could only get speed in 1st and second gear and not past 30 mph ( 5 sped maneul transmission ). Once I got home and it sat for about an hour it was fine. I have noticed also a little  of slight jerks when driving before this happened while driving to work the same morning. The problem was when I drove home that afternoon around 10 miles or so later. The weather is very hot but i was not having an issue with the car overheating and the engine light did not come on either so I had no idea it was coming. Any ideas? Thank in advanceHow many miles are on your Fiat? Was the engine revving when the car wasn’t going over 30? If so, I’m inclined to suspect the clutch is failing.It has about 90,000 miles on it. The car was still moving but as I was pressing the gas it did rev up yes. I was in 5th gear just driving along. I slowed enough to put in 2nd gear to keep moving enough to get home. I also checked under the gear boot because it is missing the gator ring and could see white lube, should It be there?I presume the “gator ring” goes at the top of the boot where it meets the shift lever. I haven’t owned a car with a manual transmission in years but I’m not sure what the white lube might be for. You shouldn’t be able to see actual gear oil, that’s in the transmission. Could it be silicone sealant? If so, a previous owner might have done some kind of DIY job. Just guessing at this point.Correct, it looks more like silicone. I just did not think it should be present. The only work that has been done in that area was for a recall years ago. A spacer or travel extender I think it was called… was put in.So you think I’m looking at the clutch going bad?Yes, probably a bad clutch. A good independent transmission shop with actual access to the car can tell you for sure. The silicone could be original or it might have something to do with when the “extender” was installed. Your guess is as good as mine at this point.Ok well thank you for responding.Did you ever find out what the issue was? Our car is doing this and we’d like to know where to start looking.",,,,

Get a new Mustang with a locking differential.
Have the differential on your current Mustang changed out to a locking model.

Either route will not be cheap. Good luck.Limited slip diff, $400
Installation, 2 hours or so
Likely cost you $600 - $700.For what it’s worth… I’d also question the value of paying $700 to change to a locking differential just to…burnout tires…?

Turn off traction control, left foot on the brake, other on the gas, tires spin, smoke ensues…

Nope



 Idkabtcars:

Or any thought on why that happened.


V6 Mustangs only got the limited slip diff for the 2011-up model years. Your 2006 has an open diff. Open diffs will only spin one wheel when there’s a loss of traction.  For your car it’s normal.  V8-powered Mustangs have had limited slip diffs as standard equipement since the early-mid 80’s.  With a limited slip diff/positraction/locker  both drive wheels will spin.Limited slip diff  $400
Installation          $700
Discovering engine too weak to spin both tires simultaneously- Pricele$$
Sure; any competent independent auto repair and modify shop should be able to change the non locking rear end gears for a “Posi-Track”, limited slip or locking rear end of your choice and maybe change the gear ratio at the same time to one more slanted towards performance.Yes, you should be concerned. Why are you wasting your money destroying tires literally  going nowhere?
Don’t be a poser and step up.
You’ve got a nice car but if you want some credibility find a Drag track, a SCCA Hill Climb, Novice race, Autocross or even a Track Day where you can really show your stuff, make some noise and possibly leave skid marks on your underwear.
Trust me, the girls you really want to impress will be more impressed by your helmet, your SCCA license and your smarts than by a lot of smoke and noise on a back street and some of them may be the girl you marry and have their own car.

Yes. Yes you should. One wheel peel or one tire fire is incalculably uncool. Devastatingly so.This reminds me of a hiring manager I know who was interviewing a young woman for a mechanical engineering position.

She answered she’d just finished rebuilding the small block V8 in her Mustang.  A glance at her fingernail collaborated this and she got an offer.",,,,
888,2019 Chevrolet Malibu- uncomfortable seat,Maintenance/Repairs,11,357,"uncomfortable front driver seat can not find a position to fit me . lower back and neck pain . there is no support in the lower back. I am very unsatisfied being a chevy fan…Unless you plan to trade-in or sell this car, I think that you should be looking at various types of pillows–both lumbar support and seat cushion–that could help you.
If you do plan to get rid of the car, make sure that you take an extended test drive in the next car prior to purchase.   Many years ago, I failed to do that, and wound up with a Honda Accord that aggravated my sciatica because the seat was set so low to the floor of the car, thus making it necessary to extend my legs straight forward.
After a couple of years I got rid of the Accord, and have been very careful ever since to do an extended test drive before buying another car.There have been seat comfort complaints on this board on many makes and models of cars and I would likely agree with them all. Not long ago I drove a 2020 Dodge Charger on an interstate trip. The car was a pleasure to drive but the seats…ugh. Felt like they were cast of concrete which is a common complaint with other makes. I’ve been through 16 surgeries so I get it.
The only car I’ve ever sat in that was pure comfort no matter what is my current and somewhat antiquated Lincoln Mark VIII. Can drive that car for over 400 miles without a stop and no pain issues.
A Subaru I owned had uncomfortable seats and after the driver’s seat back broke (at 70 MPH on the turn pike…) it gave me an excuse to swap them. A neighbor had an old Chevy Citation sitting on this property for about 25 years or so with a bad transmission. He gave me the great condition and near same shade of blue seats out of it. A few mods to the seat tracks and they were wonderful as to fit, color, and most importantly of all total comfort. One would never think of a Citation as being much good for anything…If you read these discussion boards, you will see that complaints about uncomfortable seats are a very common theme in modern cars.  Interestingly, back in the 1980s and 1990s, car seats were extremely comfortable.  I don’t know if it is due to cost-cutting, or some type of government mandate (for example, seats today are required to contain airbags) but seats today are often hard and uncomfortable.
If you happen to go to a “you pull it” junkyard, sit down in a mid-1990s Dodge Caravan, Dodge Spirit, or Dodge Shadow, and you will see that the seats back then were super-comfortable, compared to anything you can buy today.I suspect it’s a combination of both cost cutting and weight reduction for fuel economy reasons.
Personally I miss bench seats in cars.


 bcohen2010:

Interestingly, back in the 1980s and 1990s, car seats were extremely comfortable.


could also be that I was a lot younger and whole lot less achey in the 80’s and 90’s.   I had a 1993 Oldsmobile 88.  The seat felt comfortable at first, but after 75 miles I had leg cramps.  We had a 1990  Ford Aerostar van at the time and the seat and driving position were much more comfortable for me.  I found the seats in our 2003 Toyota 4Runner comfortable.  I like sitting up.  At the present time we have the 4Runner and a Sienna minivan.
My wife did a lot of traveling in her job at the university.  She found the Ford Taurus had the most comfortable seats for her.  Neither she nor I cared for the Honda Civic Hybrids in the fleet because of the seats.  My last trip before I retired I was assigned a Ford Fusion.  I thought it had comfortable seats and a good driving position.I have a hard time with threads like this. If you have a physical problem (aka PAIN)…then that seems to me would be t he #1 priority in purchasing a vehicle. If it were me I’d either test drive one for a few days and take a couple long trips or rent if that’s not an option then rent one. No way would I buy a vehicle without a long term test to see if it doesn’t aggravate my condition.I was getting neck pain on really long drives, the headrest was too far forward, turns out it was adjustable, moved it back and life was good.I think back to 1959 when my Dad was thinking about a new car.  We had a 1954 Buick with 100,000 miles on the odometer and he thought he wanted another Buick.  We road tested a Buick Invicta 4 door hard top.  I remember driving the car.  None of us in the family were comfortable.  The seats were too low and the center seat was hard because of the driveshaft tunnel.  My Dad said he wouldn’t pay $3300, the price of the new Buick in 1959, for a four passenger car.  Our 1954 Buick was much more comfortable.  In1961, the GM cars were redesigned and had higher, more comfortable seats.  The Chrysler products back in the late 1950s weren’t very comfortable for me.  I guess style was more important than comfort.Maybe we’ll snag an interior engineer that can explain a little the decisions going into seat design.  I know they used to use the dimensions for an “average” person which of course doesn’t exist.  Remember the joke about the guy with his feet in the oven and head in the refrigerator but on the average was quite comfortable?
As I remember back though the boss had a 65 Ford wagon with bench seats and I always liked the way that seat fit me.  I also think out 61 Merc had pretty comfortable bench seats.  I never had any trouble with my Olds or Buicks and could drive them all day long with not problem, but my 86 Buick Park Ave. Broham was not comfortable at all on a long drive.  It was a split bench power seat and although very soft, my posterior would get very sore after a couple hours.  So I dunno, guess you just have to try them out.  Having encountered same though, before bringing any junk yard seats home, check for snakes and rodents hiding in them.


 eddo:

Of course, we were all a lot younger 25-35 years ago.  Those were my early childhood to teenage years.  However, I am not comparing some nostalgic recollection of how I think seats felt years ago to how new car seats feel today.  I am comparing how those models feel if I sit in them today in the year 2020.
I owned a 1995 Dodge Caravan until earlier this year when I gave it away.  I have a 1993 Plymouth Sundance in my garage, which I am planning to restore.  I have sat in many of these cars in a junkyard, some with over 250,000 miles on them, and the seats are still excellent.
To be sure, I have had some vehicles with terrible, uncomfortable seats.  I worked for one company, which assigned me a Ford Econoline van from the early 2000’s.  It had less than 150,000 miles on it, but my back never hurt so much as after I drove it.  After two weeks of working for that company, I told my boss that the seat in my work truck was too uncomfortable, my back was really bothering me, and I’d need something else to drive.

889,It was an interesting week at the shop,General Discussion,24,1.1k,"10 days ago we did a major but routine service on a Prius. Monday the customer calls and says this morning when the engine started the car sounded like a motorcycle so she was having AAA tow it in. We found someone had removed the catalyst while parked at her apartment.
Tuesday we have a Chevy Equinox towed in, customer says the car will not start, offers no more info. We open the hood and find several coolant hoses loose, a motor mount missing, air intake duct off the throttle body, a replacement starter, and a used wrong battery. Also we notice the front body panels of the car are misaligned and missing fasteners, and lifting up the carpet pad on the dash shows airbag deployment. We repair what we can on the engine, test the battery and find it drops to 8 volts under load. Get the OK to install a new battery and find the issue is a no crank. Customer states he has been having this problem for a year. Engine will not turn over when key is turned. Testing and diag leads us to find the throttle body is failing. Yes, on this car if the engine computer does not think it can properly control the throttle it will disable starter operation. Replaced the throttle body and car started.
Wednesday a first-time customer comes in for an oil change on his Subaru. As the service writer goes out to get the mileage she notices a gasoline smell. Customer says he just filled tank and might have spilled. Meanwhile there is now a growing puddle of gas in the parking lot. The gas tank is damaged and leaking and needs to be replaced. Customer says “Oh, I did hear a loud clunk when I was driving here, like I ran over something.” A $1400 upsell on an oil change before we even get the car in the door.
Thursday we worked on a Ford Transit 350 3.2 diesel. We replaced the glow plugs, delivered the van (fleet customer) at 4:30pm. 8:00am Friday the customer is on the phone saying there are a bunch of warning lights on and could we have left something loose. I go over to get the van and find that someone has cut the catalyst out. And also stolen the one off the truck parked next to this one.
Friday we get a pre-purchase inspection. One of our regular customer is updating from her 2001 Sienna, found a private seller with a 2018 Camry. But, seller won’t let our customer drive the car before buying it. Seller won’t let me drive the car. Seller won’t allow me to do anything for an inspection other than check the oil and raise the car and look underneath. We advised our customer not to buy this car based on the seller being difficult.

I always love seeing these ads for cars for sale where the seller has endless excuses why the car cannot be test driven, such as no current registration/insurance, but swears up and down that it really does run fine (or works fine other than some very minor problem).  And these kind of ads run the gamut from $10,000+ newer cars all the way down to $500 “beaters”.  I can’t believe anyone would really be dumb enough to fall for such an excuse, but who knows?

Not sure. Customer left after the “inspection” and said she would think about things.100 million cars in US. Has to be many crazy seller stories.What year Equinox?  I’m always waiting for the next shoe to drop with my 2013.I want to say 2010 but I don’t recall for sure.A few years ago in OK City someone’s Mazda broke down on I-40. They left the car and returned an hour or so later with a tow truck. As the tow driver winched it up on the bed he noticed the catalytic converter was missing.
Someone had stopped right on the side of the Interstate and helped themselves to it with a Sawzall.
Still not as bad as many decades ago during the era of the 1969 Z-28s with the hot 302 in them. Someone went onto the local Chevy dealer lot here one night and heisted 2 engines, 2 transmissions, and 1 set of wheels right off the lot while doing it under the mercury vapor lighting.There’s an organized group systematically going through area subdivisions at night going through cars to steal all the unsecured goodies people leave in unlocked cars, stealing some of the cars, and cutting catalytic converter off quite a few vehicles.
The local community FB group also recently had a “new member” openly advertising that he buys catalytic converters with no documentation needed, no questions asked.  After several weeks he disappeared from the group right before all the middle of the night cat thefts.I am baffled by the costumer who did not feel the used car seller’s behavior was warning enough not to bother.The equinox sounds like a rebuild that was not finished. And then someone asks how it is otherwise? The funny thread continues.There are a lot of people out there who get completely focused on what they perceive to be a “great deal!”, and go completely tunnel vision on any other expenses or consequences.
Of course, by that point the seller already has your money and can’t be found again.There’s been a rash of cat thefts where I live too. I’m just waiting for them to hit my truck. Of course, they’ll be on camera when they do, so hopefully we can catch them.A fellow employee where I work got off work one day and told me her Plymouth would not start. It was parked in the company parking lot so I went out and checked. When I raised the hood I saw her carburetor was missing.
My son was in the Market for a Corvette. He called to tell me he found one he liked but the title had a “T” on it and the seller told him that stood for “Totaled”. I asked him, “There are lots of Vette that have not been totaled, so why buy one that has?” He wisely did not buy that Vette.Reminds me of looking for a house for my son to rent. Owner said he was called out of state for his service in “the Armed forces, branch of army” and that he had no family in town to show the house, but that he would FedEx me the keys after I paid the rent and security deposit. Uh-huh. Reported him to the state Attorney General.The guy might even be lying about being an active duty soldier
Impersonating a military member is among the worst scams/crimes out there, as far as I’m concernedOver the years I’ve had several experiences while traveling of a dishonest jerk trying to scam me about my car.  One gas station attendant tried telling me I needed a new tire soon as he saw my out of state license plate.  Another time my mom and I caught the gas station guy letting air out of one of the tires.
On balance, though, three times I have had car trouble while traveling and was treated with total honesty.  First time turned out to be a clogged fuel filter.  Second time was an alternator going bad.  Third time was a burned out headlight.  Each time the problem was fixed properly at a fair price.

Many years ago, 60 Minutes did a hidden camera segment focused on a few scamming gas stations near I-95 Interchanges in Georgia and South Carolina.   One of them specialized in slitting customers’ fan belts when they lifted the hood to check the oil.    Another one used to squirt oil on a rear shock absorber if a customer asked for a tire inflation check.   God-only-knows how many customers paid for unnecessary belt and shock absorber replacements before these scams were exposed.
That being said, many years ago, when I had the misfortune to travel to Florida in a co-worker’s completely un-maintained Ford Maverick, we broke down twice, and in both cases we received swift and fairly-priced repairs in Virginia and South Carolina.

891,Bypass Relief Valve or Not?,General Discussion,3,197,"Ok here is an interesting one (for me).  I had a reman 5.3 engine installed on my 04 Tahoe. I am keeping old motor for rebuild / swap project.
Anyway reman shop installed a high flow oil pump.  So my oil pressure runs 60-70psi.   Not the normal factory 40psi.   Reman shop wants it that way and owns the 3 year warranty on it.
GMTruck blog techs indicate some concern around oil filter bypass relief valve.   Will increase pressure cause my filter valve to open and bypass?  I use ACdelco PF46E filters and have now learned they don’t have a bypass relief valve.  Tech at dealership indicated relief valves only needed for high oil pressure engines like Corvettes, etc.   Now I am thoroughly confused on WTF to do?

Nothing.  Keep using PF46E filters.
Change to a filter with a BRV.

I am going to call reman shop and get direction from them.  But does anyone with experience with oil pressure and oil filter BRV valves have any I do to share?


 glennst1011_160276:

I am going to call reman shop and get direction from them.


I would do what ever the reman shop says to do, only way to keep the warranty.If filters are replaced regularly there shouldn’t be any problem with pressure opening the by-pass valve but I don’t understand why anyone would want to increase the pressure from OE design.Agreed on the why would they not use standard pressure pump.   Not sure if you know about pumps but apparently high rpm applications like Camaro, Corvettes, or folks upgrading engines for more horsepower (turbo, supercharger, etc) usually require higher oil pressure.  10 psi per 1K of RPM.
So many shops put in a high pressure spring into the pump.
Anyway I am probably fine but am trying to ensure 100% this is not causing any problems.  Many techs on blogs say they don’t like it, that they would cha get it, but I can’t so now I am trying to learn more about it.  Is it fine?  Or would higher pressure Ops the filter bypass?
Sounds like not, but if I keep using the same ACdelco filter it won’t have it anyway.",,,,

895,08 Avalon vs 2011 corolla,Buying/Selling,22,534,"Hi all. So I’m on the verge of choosing a new car. My two choices are a 2008 Avalon or a 2011 corolla.
The Avalon has 108k miles, is a NY native car so has some small patches of rust underneath but nothing crazy. The dealer just replaced front and back brakes, both mufflers, the battery, and a metal strip that runs under the gas tank. It’s had one owner and no accidents. Test drive felt good.
The corolla is from PA, and has just about no rust underneath because of that. It has 134k miles. Back brakes need to be done but the dealer said he would do that up and anything else needed.
The corolla is $6,500 and the Avalon is $6,000. I like the Avalon a bit more because of the overall look and the more powerful engine, but I’m more into reliability.
Opinions?Toss up, Avalon will give a bit more room, the Corolla is newer.  Both should be reliable, but have an independent mechanic go over the car before you make an offer.    You do not want any surprises.If it’s for short commutes, maybe the Corolla, but if I’m putting hours in it, the Avalon, assuming you find it comfortable and it passes the mechanic’s inspection.12 year old rust state car or an 9 year old rust state car? Yeah, I’m strongly leaning to the 2011 Corolla. Cars in these types of states die not because of mechanical failure but rust damage.
Have a mechanic give each a serious look-under and screwdriver poke. If anything looks sketchy at all on the Avalon go for the Corolla.


 jeffreyd182_161151:

You don’t think that PA is a rust-belt state?
Really?
I suggest that you follow the advice of Mustangman:

Have a mechanic you trust check out the one you like most, including a close look at any rust in the body and underside. If it turns out the rust is worse than you think (probable), consider how long the car body will last. I’m guessing you are a young person, and you don’t need a luxury car. Maybe start with the Corolla, but the choice is yours. This will cost you about $125, and it’s worth it.I inspected under the car and it’s pretty pristine. I thought PA didn’t use salt. The more you know.I looked under both cars. The Avalon definitely has more rust, but nothing I could see was anything other than surface. Of course I could be wrong, in fact, I welcome it lol.
I do plan on doing a pre purchase inspection.I lived in PA for many many years, they use an enormous amount of salt on the roads
Over the last five winters, PennDOT  used  an average of 844,000 tons of  salt  to keep  Pennsylvania  drivers moving. If  winter does  strike, PennDOT  will  have crews treating roadways around the clock, but the department’s aim  is  to keep  roads  passable rather than completely free of ice and snow.

For being a 9 year old car from a salt belt state, it has a remarkable lack of rust.I have an unreasonably adverse reaction to any rust on my car, so I’d pick the Corolla on that alone.
Once rust starts, it doesn’t stop, and it keeps growing. If you don’t care if your car is a rusty heap, then the Avalon might be the better choice - though note that Avalons required premium gas at one point, and I don’t remember when that stopped. So the Avalon might end up making you spend 40-50 cents more a gallon.


 jeffreyd182_161151:

The amount of snow varies greatly in PA. Philadelphia gets a lot less snow than Erie, for instance.As a trucker always operating out of the Buffalo NY Area I can tell you the the use of salt spread in PA especially in the middle of the night is minuscule compare to NY.  The worst areas for salt are Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse. The rest of the state just doesn’t get as much snow except the North Country esp. the area West of the Tug hill plateau, but because it gets so cold there, they use more sand than salt.
NY uses 16+tond of salt per lane mile. similar to the New England states, but a lot more in my area, we find cars from PA to be almost rust free compared to ours.  I have never worn out a car, they die from rust. The exceptions being in my younger street racing days but that was in the 50s.How about a Camry?  Close to Avalon in size for less $


 jeffreyd182_161151:

For being a 9 year old car from a salt belt state, it has a remarkable lack of rust.


Much depends on the specific location, Southern PA has mild winters. My cousins moved to York in the 1970’s and remarked about the lack of snowfall, 25 inches a year.
Philadelphia; 22.4"" a year.
It shouldn’t be hard to find a clean car in or from Pennsylvania.I would avoid rust at all cost, used to live in CT!
Either the Corolla, or if you think it is too small and you have a long commute, look for a Camry.
On a similar note, the 2011 Corolla is probably the same size as the 90;s Camry.It really doesn’t matter how many inches of snow a place gets as much as how often. Southern Ohio doesn’t get many inches but everytime 1/2 is predicted the roads get brined.
And then it warms up to 34 degrees so the salt can get the rust started.If it matters to anyone, I plan on doing a fluid film undercoat before the winter starts.I wouldn’t buy either of these cars, but the 2011 Corolla is probably the better buy for a lot of reasons.

896,Flat spotting or something else?,Maintenance/Repairs,20,380,"Took my pickup truck for a balance/align/rotate recently, and was told that the two rear tires have “slipped belts” and need to be replaced. Having done some reading and thinking, I am skeptical and would appreciate some feedback:

The tires are modern steel-belted radials that have ~15k miles on them. There are no surface irregularities on the tread or sidewalls. They appear to be in very good shape.
The truck was, however, parked for almost 2 years, during which time I drove it ~1/2 mile every couple of months. The shop said the two rear tires were the ones with the problem, but that may have been after they rotated them from the front, where one would expect flat-spotting to develop.
There is a tiny amount of vibration >65-70 mph, but everything feels great at lower speeds. Watching the truck drive, I can also see a barely noticeable amount of wheel wobble up and down at highway speeds.

I’ve read the threads where “slipped belts” are said not to exist any more, except when the term is used to refer to tread separation. So, how does one tell the difference between flat spotting, tread separation, and (if they do exist) slipped belts by looking at the tires?This site  tirerack.com has the answers to your question.
https://www.tirerack.com/tires/tiretech/techpage.jsp?techid=42 11How old are the tires?2.5 years…Thanks. I read that article. But unless I’m missing something, it doesn’t actually say how to tell the difference between flat spotting and other things that can happen to tires…What kind of shop is it?  How much do you trust this shop? Is there another that you might try that specializes in tires and alignments?This is a specialized tire/alignment shop, a regional chain. No basis to trust or not trust this particular shop. I do plan to take it somewhere else for a second opinion, though.
Still interested in how the symptoms of flat spotting differ from tread separation and slipped belts (if that’s a real thing).

Then why don’t you listen to the tire experts?
TesterI have only experienced flat spotting with nylon cord tires. Used to just drive it out. Get a second opinion my thought.Tester: Have had mixed luck at tire shops before, and never used this one before. Plus, generally, I like to understand things and prove them myself before spending $500 or $1k…I’d get a second opinion. The tires didn’t sit in the same spot for all that time. Every time you moved the truck it is highly likely the tires came to rest on a different part of the circumference.True. And I will.
Still looking for a guide to how to tell the difference myself, though…Agree with the nylon cord tire’s do they still make them ? I have not seen  them for many year’s.No idea. These are definitely steel-belted radials, though.Flat spots are rather uniform, looks like the pavement they sat on.
Tread separation is usually an irregular bulge across the tread. In some cases there may not be a bulge but give the tread a zig-zag appearance while rotating.
The remedy for either problem is the same, replace the tires.


 Renegade:

I sure hope not !!Ageldor,
Retired tire engineer here.  Here’s my website:  Barry’s Tire Tech 2
Among the things I did was analyze failed tires - so, Yes!, I can tell the difference between a tire with a separation and one with a flatspot, but it requires specialized equipment - something only a tire manufacturer would have - to answer this exact question.
BTW, a tire can have both! - but it would be rare.
You will NOT find a guide - too complex and too many exceptions.  But you sound determined, so let’s play the percentages.
Step 1)  With a gloved hand (work glove, not surgeon’s glove!), rub your hand over the entire tread surface.  You are looking for a bulge = separation.  HOWEVER, no bulge does NOT mean no separation (1st exception!)
If you have a separation, replace the tire IMMEDIATELY!.  Not tomorrow, TODAY!
Step 2)  Assuming no bulge, look at the sidewall of the tire.  On it will be a listing of what fabric was used in the tire, divided by sidewall and tread.  Typically it will say “Tread:  2 steel plies + 2 polyester plies”.  In this case it is very unlikely that there is a separation.  (more exceptions!)
But if nylon is mentioned in addition to the steel and polyester, then a separation can be disguised. - again, no bulge does NOT mean no separation!  Plus the use of nylon makes it more likely that there is a flatspot!
Another indicator:  If the vibration gets worse (over a couple of hundred miles), that’s what separations do.  Flatspots do the opposite.
That is as far as it can be taken without specialized equipment.
But your narrative sounds more like these are flatspots.  Flatspots can be generated in as little as 2 months given the right conditions.  And the longer the tire sits, the stronger the flatspot.  The small vibration you are feeling is unlikely a separation and likely a flatspot.


 Renegade:

Agree with the nylon cord tire’s do they still make them ? I have not seen them for many year’s.


Nylon is currently used in cap plies - an overlay on top of the steel belts to restrict growth due to centrifugal forces.
Why nylon, if it flatspots?  Because nylon has this remarkable property of shrinking when it is heated, making it very advantageous for high speed tires.  So tire manufacturers take steps in the manufacturing process to minimize the flatspotting tendencies.  That means that flatspotting only becomes a problem under certain conditions - and tires sitting for a long time is among them.",,,,

Uh, no . . .

First you say EPC . . . then you say EOC
Which is it?
In any case, you need to diagnose that rich condition properly
A completely clogged engine air filter or an injector that is flowing way too much would be examples of a rich condition.  An air cleaner housing full of acorns . . . think rodents . . . could also cause a rich condition.
I’ve also seen cases of cheapo aftermarket air filters where the glue is slobbered on so thick that it  caused a rich condition . . . because the glue was actually restricting air flowSorry its. EPC.

898,P06DE - 2011 Jeep GC Engine Oil Pressure Control Circuit Stuck On,Maintenance/Repairs,7,11.5k,"Hello All,
Looking for some assistance on a check engine light code for a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited 3.6L V6 Flex-fuel 4WD SUV. The code is “P06DE - Engine Oil Pressure Control Circuit Stuck On”.
The problem started a few months ago where the light would come on after about an hour and a half into a road trip. The light would eventually go away and then reoccur during the next road trip. Lately the light has been coming on and off more regularly and has currently been on for the last week or so straight.
Each time the light comes on I have went to the oil pressure display screen and observed the oil pressure to be 30-40PSI (cannot remember the exact range, but somewhere close to this) cruising at highway speeds and the pressure would jump to about 70PSI when I step on the gas and then come back down once cruising again.
It seems like to oil pressure sensor is functioning ok, maybe its intermittently faulting to cause the check engine light to come on?  Each time the light has come on I’ve checked and verified the pressure feedback was ok.
Has anyone else experienced this problem?
Thanks,
GaryFrom a Jeep forum:
“P06DE … It is the oil pressure sensor, it’s on the back of the oil cooler assembly, you have to take the upper and lower intake manifolds off to get to it. It only takes 30 seconds to change the sensor, but it took me 3 hours just to get to it.”Here’s a page about it:
https://myjeeplife.wordpress.com/tag/p06de/ 754Thank for the links circutsmith!
I did see these posts in my prior research and I am not getting the P0520 - Oil Pressure Circuit Fail in combination with the P06DE code that I am getting.  These posts say to replace the pressure sensor which appears to be functioning based on seeing the feedback on the screen.
In doing some more research it looks like there may be a solenoid that switches the system between low and high pressure mode.  Others also reference the P06DE code as a warning that the system is stuck in high pressure mode.  I am wondering if the solenoid is sticking sometimes it stays in high pressure mode after accelerating?  I think I’ll try and leave the oil pressure screen up when driving and see if i can catch it and see if the pressure is staying high when is should be low at lower RPMs.  Another post mentioned that it switches between high and low around 3500RPM.There is a software update to address that fault code, check under the hood for PCM update labels to determine if the update may have been performed.

I think this is worth a try since it probably should be done anyways.@garygagne hi there, were you able to check if PCM update resolved your issue? I’ve got the same engine in my Dodge Grand Caravan and experience same exact MIL while oil pressure is changing depending on RPM and engine temperature. Thanks in advance for your response!
PS. Just noticed that your post was written three years ago. Sorry for digging up that old topic \-:It’s ok, @dwarfv_171578. @garygagne may pop up because you tagged him.",,,,
