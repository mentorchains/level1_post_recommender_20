If a distributor is cooperating, you are still likely to see people buying products from them and illicitly selling on Amazon.

The questions truly depends on the size of the distributor.  You have distributors that are small and local all the way up to distributors that do 25-100 Billion annually.

The larger distributors the only true value you can add is sales volume.  Unfortunately until your buying big #s that is not a real value prop.   For the smaller distributor you may be able to add value by helping them get sales volume on new items they bring in or slower items they need sales on.  The very very small distributors may need help in other areas, but the med to big ones just want sales in my experience.\nHopefully that helps a bit.', 'Thank you Liz and Ben!', 'Distributors: Care about how deep your pockets are.\nManufacturers: Care about how you will represent their brand and if you will damage the consumers image of the brand.

30,Winning new accounts using trade shows,Product Sourcing,[],"Epic day today. We won a new account worth $10K+/mo in gross profit. Only took me two years from the first time I spoke with them until now.
Got a “we are definitely doing business together. I’m firing 2 of my 4 sellers and adding you as soon as they sell through” from another account that should be worth $50K to $80K/mo in revenue.
I also have at least 10 really solid leads and I expect to win 2-3 of them at a minimum. Another 20 leads that will need nurturing.
If I had to guess, within 90 days, our revenue will be up over $100K/mo.
Here’s a few take aways from my time at the conference over the last few days:

Strong selling brands get pitched far more than you can imagine
Some sellers even offer bribes ($10K cash under the table) to get account approval (didn’t work)
Everyone’s pitch sounds the same (we’ll help you remove unauthorized sellers and increase sales)

So how do you break through?

Rapport is the key to creating opportunities and winning accounts. If they don’t like/trust you, you have no chance in hell.
Content plays a role in building trust. Your smile plays a role in generating rapport.
Be persistent. (email & the phone is great for this)
Go after brands that aren’t yet on everybody’s radar screen. Look for brands that are the up and comers.
DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND KNOW WTF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.

There is a MOUNTAIN of opportunity in wholesale. There is a never ending supply of new brands. You simply have to hustle your ass off to get/keep them, and to do that, you have to want it REALLY BAD.

Typically, listings will show up in the sponsored product area if ads are being run.\nIf you are trying to find if a specific listing is being advertised, and it didn’t show up as a sponsored product in the brand search, you will have to run some searches using keywords from the listing.

Pull the brand summary report on Viral Launch. This tells me the trend in sales volume and average price. I can also quickly see the top products and how many sellers each have.

If I don’t kill the deal at this stage, my next step is:


Look at the Helium10 product listing score for the top 3-4 products. Ideally, I’m going to find listings with a score under 7/10.


Type in the main keywords from the title of each of the top 3-4 listings to see if ads appear for these keywords. Ideally, no ads appear.


If #2 and #3 are in my favor, I’m DEFINITELY going to call this brand because their marketing sucks and so do their current sellers. They just probably don’t realize that yet and it is my job to help them see the light.

50,OUCH! - Current Supplier - Remove Your Inventory,Product Sourcing,[],"Hi there,
Tough day and a new challenge for us today. 
We’ve placed several orders with one of our suppliers, in fact, we have a large order enroute to us currently.
Today they contacted us and said that our account has been flagged for selling on Amazon, which is against their distribution policy. They went on to say that they don’t allow anyone to sell on Amazon, and they demanded that we pull all inventory. They said that if we have any more issues, our account with them will be terminated.


When we signed up we were provided with a MAP policy, but no distribution policy (we checked very thoroughly).


We know they currently have other people selling on Amazon, so this may be like a “we don’t want anymore sellers” type of situation.


We haven’t responded yet, because it appears to be a pivotal point in the relationship and we could really use some guidance.
Any tips on overcoming this objection?","['@MBahe That is definitely a challenging dilemma!\nOn one hand you don’t want to lose this brand and on the other hand you don’t want the inventory to just sit. My advice would be to first try and understand why the brand doesn’t want to sell on Amazon. This could one of those situations that Trent has always talked about when brands are tired of working with bad Amazon sellers.\nYou might also want to show them how much in sales they would lose if they stop selling on Amazon and maybe talk about some value adds that you provide.\nIf nothing works, then you can possibly ask them to provide a one time exception to sell through the inventory. This way you don’t take a loss and can maintain a relationship for the future.\nPlease let me know how it turns out. I would be very interested to hear your progress.', 'Thanks for the suggestions Ibrahim.\nCurrently we’re just sort of compiling a cheat sheet of the possible responses that we might encounter so that we’re no knocked off guard by something they say.\nIf nothing else, we plan on asking them to allow us to sell the inventory we have, and we’ll have to find some other way to get rid of the inventory that’s on its way to our facility (either return or sell by other means).\nI’ll keep you posted.', '@MBahe I would apologize and say you didn’t see any documentation saying you couldn’t sell on Amazon.

Is there a way to research the inventory being shipped to you and see if UPS or Fedex either one has a budding sales platform you could use ?\nWhat does this company LIKE about 3rd party sellers, and NOT like about 3rd party sellers ?  Research online this companies goals and mission and mission statement, and the directions their philanthropy goes, consider using it as a template for your adding value campaign .  Treat this company and situation like writing a grant request, find out what really makes them tick and not only appeal to that but position your value adding selling methods and treatment of the inventory to flow toward those lines.\nDo they have any schools or orphanages or institutions or causes they as a company espouse or contribute to ?    Design a strategy to create value and  SOP’s to detail and reproduce that, and benefit XYZ% those places they espouse or contribute to - IF and only IF so doing does not compromise your own companies mission.  Consider getting reviews and receipts from said places to use copies of in your  value added proposition positioning efforts.\nAsk for higher pay grade tutoring on this project and when the dust settles - make it a SOP.

The whole art of selling it to not sell anything.  Here is what I mean.  If you listen to any of Trent’s podcasts or watch any of his video’s the key that most people miss when he talks about talking with brands is that he knows he has something the brand needs.  Most people approach brands in the totally opposite mind set.  (ie I need this brand for my business) When you have properly prepared for the call, researched their listings, researched their offline business, know your value proposition, etc you don’t need to sell anything.  Your whole call is about sharing the research that you did on their business.  If a brand does not see your value when you share all this information with them, don;t waste your time “convincing” them to do anything.  Once you convince them to do something once, you will have to continue to “convince” them again and again and again…', '@Dennis, great article. \nI remember read this in January.', 'Good point @MattB.  I battle to frame this correctly based on how well the brand has optimized its distribution channels.

It depends on their size and current online presence.  You could see if they would be interested in having you manage their Amazon business in exchange for being a seller.  If you create enough value in their eyes they will work with you.\nAlso, one thing that I try to remember is no might mean not right now.

They don’t have systems to they just have BOB manage the amazon thing. (even if they do a good job).  They are small minded because if they thought like NIKE. Kellogg, Ridgid.  They would spend money, create systems and then just focus on making products and letting the sales to others.  (ie walmart)\nI say all that to say this.

Because they are not supported by an action plan that makes achieving these goals the likely outcome.

Over the next week or so, I’m going to share some of my biggest takeaways.
Here’s the first…
If you are selling stuff online, you should seriously consider building (and amplifying) a personal brand.
Why?
Authority, credibility, and revenue on demand. (Bright Ideas is the most profitable thing I do)
While I have been building my brand for years, I have not been amplifying it nearly as well as I should have been. In 2020, that is going to change and my income is going to go up. A lot.
How do you amplify?
Ad spend.
More ad spend = more eyeballs = more subscribers = more revenue on demand.
Tomorrow, I’ll dig more into the ways to do this.
For today, my ask is this: please take 2 minutes right now to complete my community feedback survey 2.

67,Pain is necessary,Management,[],"Today I started my morning like I always do; by watching motivational speeches on Youtube while I’m in the bathroom shaving, brushing my teeth, etc…
I like to start my day this way because it fires me up and ensures that when I sit down at my desk, I’m ready to make shit happen!
If you don’t yet have a morning routine that includes meditation, consuming inspirational content, and whatever else you need to get your head in the game, I’d like to challenge you to start TODAY.
To help you with that, I’m going to share with you the video that I watched this morning: https://youtu.be/3wi65UW_nJk 3
This video was created by an African American man who grew up in the projects. His name is William King Hollis and if you think you have any disadvantages that are preventing you from being more successful in business and in life, I suspect hearing his story might help you to put that in perspective.
If you want to be successful in business; pain is necessary. If it wasn’t, everyone would own a successful company, wouldn’t they?
The difference between those that do, and those that only talk, is their ability to suffer through the pain.
Want proof? Think about anyone that has ever won a gold medal. Think their training was pain free?
Think about any actor that has hit it big. Think their early years were pain free?
I doubt it.
Pain is necessary. If you want to become financially successful, you have to be 100% committed to that goal; regardless of how much pain you are going to have to endure.
Now go make it happen!

68,Takeaway #2 from the Mastermind Weekend,Management,[],"Today I’m going to share my next big takeaway from the mastermind I attended last weekend.
As I wrote yesterday, the biggest area that I have dropped the ball in building my personal brand has been to rely solely on organic traffic and not use any advertising.
In 2020, I’m going to start advertising, and I’m going to do it in two ways.
Way #1: Facebook retargeting campaigns. Thankfully, I’ve had a Facebook pixel on my site for ages, so my Facebook audience will be pretty big and as retargeting is the cheapest way to advertise online, showing ads to people who have already been to my site will be pretty inexpensive.
Way #2: Running Youtube ads to cold traffic (people who have never been to my site and have no idea who I am). These campaigns will be more costly and I actually did experiment with them a tiny bit in mid 2019.
Being as I want to learn a lot more about running ad campaigns, expect me to publish more interviews with ad experts in the weeks/months ahead.
In fact, I just recorded one with a woman who used to work at both Facebook and Instagram and I’m working on putting a deal together with her to run my campaigns for me.
When it comes to running ads, you have to lay the right foundation, and a huge part of that foundation is knowing exactly what your audience wants, as well as the language they use to describe it.
That is why I’m asking you to take 2 minutes to fill out my community feedback survey.
Why take the time to help me? Because I’m going to help you by coming out with more free training material for you and if you don’t tell me what you want/need, I won’t know what to create.

69,How to significantly increase your supplier lead generation,Management,[],"On yesterday’s eCommerce Fast Track mastermind call, one of our members (Ben) and I talked about some of the things I learned while at the mastermind, and what I’m about to share with you is particularly applicable to your prospecting for new suppliers.
Why do so many sellers struggle to generate product/supplier leads?
They struggle because lead generation is a level 3 problem and they start doing it before completing the work needed for level 1 and level 2.
What are the first two levels, you ask?
Level 1 is authority and level 2 is positioning.
Think about this for a minute. If I’m trying to get you to book a call with me to consider partnering up to sell your products on Amazon and I don’t have any authority/credibility, how likely are you going to be to book a call with me?
Not very likely.
Now considering my positioning (messaging).
If one Amazon seller’s website messaging is “we sell on Amazon” and their competitor’s messaging is “we help brands solve Amazon-related problems”; which company would be more likely to appeal to a brand?
Obviously, it would be the company that helps brands solve their problems (because there are already far too many sellers that don’t do anything more than sell the product)
So…does it make sense to you that generating leads would be a lot easier if you have plenty of authority and the right positioning?
Of course it would be easier!

Regarding his website, I gave Nick the following advice: Study Netrush.com 2 and Pattern.com 6 to see the types of content they publish and then do something similar. He needs to write the content himself, and if he doesn’t know how to build a Wordpress site, he can easily find helpers on Fiverr.com or upwork.com. It will be very inexpensive.

75,Hear from a $65M Seller,Management,['Leadership'],"On today’s eCommerce Fast Track 13 conference call, we talked about some really cool stuff!
The first item discussed was a Reddit AMA 19 from a $65 million dollar seller by the name of BuyBoxer 3. I haven’t read the entire thread yet, but you can bet I’m going to! One take away was that this company is spending $1,500/mo for Keep a data.
You can bet I’d like to better understand how they are using this data and I’m planning to dig into it. If you have thoughts on how they are using it, reply in the comments, ok?
After that, we talked at length about the anatomy of a discovery call with a prospective brand. How to start the call, what to say, questions to ask, etc…
Making sure you are scheduling as many of these calls as you can (from the replies you receive) is absolutely critical to your success. If you are new, doing these calls will give you practice…and then once you have been doing them for a while, you will start winning more accounts.
As proof of that, earlier this week, I was speaking with the sales rep who works for a friend’s Amazon business, and she told me that if she can schedule a call with a brand that says, “we don’t want any more Amazon sellers”, that she can win the account 80-90% of the time. The big lesson here is this: GET ON THE PHONE at every chance you can.
Next, we talked about two new podcast interviews that are going to be published in the next few weeks (http://brightideas.co/273 4 and http://brightideas.co/274 3). In these interviews, I learned a great deal about Google Tag Manager, why it is important, and how to use it, plus something called attributed revenue.
Why should you care about this stuff? Simple. The more you know about digital marketing, the better off you are when it comes to being able to have intelligent conversations with brands…and the inevitable outcome of your making a very positive first impression on brands is that they will want to do business with you, if for no other reason than to get access to your brain.

82,How to sell a lead on the idea of product reviews = more sales,Amazon Specific,[],"Hey -
So I have a lead I want to approach with the idea of creating automated emails using Feedback Genius to increase their product sales. They’re going to list some items on Amazon, but I don’t think they realize how long it can take to get enough reviews to get their sales flowing.
I want to set up automated emails, customize them to the product, and create a PDF to drive their review rate up to 6-7% using Feedback Genius. I haven’t done this with new listings before, so I’m trying to figure out how to discuss this so it’s set up for win-win from the start.
I’d also offer to monitor and respond to negative reviews for them.
Anywho, I’m thinking of telling them they’ll get a much slower rate of reviews without using automated emails or a PDF, which means if I add those two types of value for them, that will shorten their time to grow sales significantly. And the same with responding to the negative product reviews.
So, do I tell them I expect about a .5% review rate without any emails sent, 2% with a custom email sent, and about 6% if we advertise a bonus PDF? And then hold myself accountable for showing them those metrics with Feedback Genius.
And if they’re convinced, only after they see that value would I ask them to sign a contract.
It’s scary. Haven’t done this before. Just know it works.

93,Tax interview for non US citizen with US LLC,Amazon Specific,[],"Hoping someone may know the answer here…
I’m a non US citizen with a US LLC. Currently i’m selling under my own name because in the tax interview it says for single member LLCs, put your own personal name.
However, of course i’d much rather be registered under my LLC name and address.
And if i have a US registered LLC, surely that is a business and US entity that is subject to US taxes?
When i enter “business” rather than “individual” on the form instead and say i’m a US person for tax reasons, it asks what kind of LLC - C-Corp, S-Corp or Partnership, then i can enter my EIN number (My LLC is just a simple single member LLC, no mention of any C-Corp or S-Corp)

All I am sharing below is based solely on my own personal experience, and professional advice provided to me. I strongly recommending you always seek independent legal and/or financial advice.\nI hope the following helps you better understand the issue so that you can gain a bit more clarity and decide how to move forward.\nI too am non US resident and I know exactly what you’re talking about in this scenario.\nThis is one of the reasons I actually shut down my US single member LLC and established a company in my own country.\nAmazon’s tax interview is setup correctly, and does ask the correct questions from a tax perspective.\nThe issue is however, their system drags across the single member details and uses that same information as the legal entity, thus why your personal name shows up as the legal entity inside of Seller Central.\nI escalated this issue on numerous occasions with Amazon and explained the issue even at their legal level, however, despite also having sought clarification through a US based tax attorney, Amazon still said it is setup correctly in their system.\nThere is no way around it as a single member LLC entity when you’re an international non resident single member.\nThe biggest issue I could foresee with this is that your vendor issued invoices will always be in the name of the legal entity, your LLC, and so this will never match with Amazon’s backend system.\nIf Amazon ever asks for invoices for verification, you’ll very likely hit major issues, an unlikely be able to prove anything.\nOperating under wholesale business model using that legal structure is risky, especially with the level of frivolous IP and authenticity claims that occur on the platform now.\nYou’ll also never be able to get ungated if requested to provide invoices because again, the entity details wont’ match. I know this for sure because I experienced and lost money from it.\nAlso, be aware of the additional reporting requirements that the IRS now has in place for non resident LLCs.\nVery few people are aware of these new requirements until it is too late.\nThere are all very important considerations you should understand when deciding to continue operating as a US entity, and another reason why I would suggest you seek professional advice from someone who specialises in US tax law for NON US residents.\nI hope this helps.\nAll the best.', 'Hey there,\nThanks very much for your very detailed reply, really appreciate it.\nYes those issues you mentioned i already came across (invoices with my LLC name) but i got around it by asking them to put my own name and address on it, which they were happy to do but that just sounds amateur to most suppliers i’m sure.\nI’ll be getting in touch with a professional as well as looking into a limited company in my own country.\nI assume you’re operating under your company name in your home country, my i ask if your US suppliers have an issue with this?\nThanks very much again', 'Hi,\nI’m glad it helped.\nUnfortunately it’s another one of the many challenges us internationals experience when starting out on the marketplace in the USA.\nYes I established a new company in my home country and then applied for an EIN, which you will need to sell on the marketplace, and yes, it is very easy to get via a phone call to the IRS.\nThen it’s up to you whether you get a reseller certificate.\nYou don’t need one, however you will find a LOT of brand owners who won’t open an account unless you provide them with one, even when you clearly explain that you’re an entity domiciled outside of the USA so legally don’t need one as I was advised by a tax attorney.\nIt’s more to remove that as an objection, but it does come with compliance requirements.\nOnce again, decide which way is right for you once you speak with a professional.\nHope this helps.', 'Hi,\nI’ll be investigating your way of doing things this weekend.\nThis information is a massive help, and once again, it’s hugely appreciated!\nWish you all the best with your business\nP.S Anyone following this i’ll update it if i have anything new to report about this issue', 'Hi AnthonyD.\nVery useful advice, thanks for sharing.\nAre you able to share the details of the accountant you use please?

105,Wholesale VS Agency business model?,Amazon Specific,['All Other Amazon Related Issues'],"Hello,
This question is directly related to @Trent_Dyrsmid  business model (hope Trent or anyone that has a good answer can reply to this).
When pitching my company business model to other entrepreneurs, specifically referring to the wholesale model that focus on closing special agreements with brands to have exclusive distribution on Amazon, I always get asked whether what I provide is a service or not.
I initially thought it was not but then I realized that working on the same offer but providing it  as a service might be convenient under certain aspects.
In the “traditional” wholesale model, my company would first close an agreement for the exclusivity to be the only seller of those products on Amazon, then I would periodically buy the products from the brand and do as much as I can to improve sales because it will benefit me (improve pics, listing and invest in ppc)
On the other hand, if I would give the same kind of offer to the brand, but offering it as a service, I would manage their Amazon account (still being the only seller as I would represent the brand itself) but this time I won’t need to purchase any stock in advance (as the brand would provide them), and I will not need to invest in any optimization as it’s their account so I can offer that to them as a service. In terms of payment then I would just get a commission out of sales but without advancing any stock.
I see in the service case (so essentially providing Amazon account management) similar upsides to the “traditional” model (eg. exclusivity) but less downsize (eg. no need to purchase stock in advance)
What are your thoughts about this? Am I missing anything?
My other biggest concern in the “traditional” model is: how do you make sure that the brand won’t end the exclusivity agreement after you have built BSR for their products and invested in PPC and listing optimization?
Or what can you do to minimize that risk?
Thanks in advance","['Yes you can absolutely go about it as an account management service.\nThe biggest upside, as you noted, is you don’t have to use a lot of up front capital.\nThe biggest downside is that the brand now sees you as very accountable to provide those services.\nWe’ve found that the accounts where we are sending them checks (buying inventory) are much less headache than when they’re sending us checks (service model).\nWe do ask brands to sign a contract for 6 mo (which auto renews), but the best way to make sure they won’t end the exclusivity agreement is to do great work for them. We also try not to expend any more capital (subcontractor, labor, etc) towards growing the account than the profit we make from the account. We’re pretty transparent with the brand about this.', 'Thank you for your answer!\nAdding to that, with your model then, do you only look for big brands with strong presence on Amazon?

Once the above step is followed and a brand registry account is created, please follow the same procedure as on this case to raise a request of “Updating role or add a new user to account”. This will help us process the role assignment.

We are in the process of opening a store front and are not really sure whether to make it niche specific or a general store that can sell health, household, beauty, electronics… the question is how do we go about in making it a general store? don’t brands want you to see niche a specific store? for example a shoe brand would want to see a shoe store or a beauty brand would want see a beauty store, however we are trying to get into multiple profitable categories and want to use the store to open the accounts since most brands require brick and mortar. I remember you mentioning that you will have a store in your new building and I assume you’ll use that to open accounts too! how will you go about in different categories if the store is not niche specific?

what do you think??

I have been on the brand side and on the distribution side in my career.  Being “distributor” has many different meanings and there are distributors of all different sizes depending on the industry etc.\nIn my experience volume dictates discounts and price not definition.  Typically a distributor gets a better price because they buy in larger volume and sell to other businesses, but with many brand a truck load is a truck load and they will price it the same.  We do not call ourselves a distributor in any way as we do not distribute product to other companies.  Some brands want regional distributors and will then want you to be able to warehouse and sell products to other companies.  This is not a bad model if you’re able to execute it.    At the end of the day if you can purchase significant volume you should be able to negotiate discounts with almost any brand.\nHope that helps', 'Hi @Ben Thanks for the input but if you are not a “distributor” in their system they will not give you the volume you are looking to buy or is that not the case?', 'In general I don’t think that is true.

137,Strategies to Reduce Shipping Costs,Fulfillment,['Shipping'],"Shipping is a big expense in our business. We have all sorts of things we’ve done to reduce costs:


we always ask if better shipping prices are available


we shop around whenever possible… with our freight broker, with UPS vs FedEx, etc… prices change all the time and if we don’t shop around we’ll miss those changes


if we’re sending parcel shipments, we’ll sometimes repackage in larger boxes - as close to 50 lb as we can get so we don’t run into oversize fees


If we’re selling FBM items on Amazon around the $10 price point, we’ll price them at $9.99 so we don’t have to provide tracking… this keeps shipping costs down substantially and nets us more than listing the product for $10.99


What other ways have you been able to reduce shipping costs?","['Although it takes longer, we try to use LTL from our prep center to Amazon.  You always have to weigh the time against the cost.', 'A little ninja trick I recently learned with FBA shipping plans is-\nNot entering box dimensions. Only enter weight\nMore of a time saver but, sometimes also cheaper shipment cost with just weight and no dimensions.\nMakes communications easier/quicker also if shipping direct from a supplier to FBA.

What is the point of optimizing your listing and choosing your keywords?
Keywords on Amazon are almost entirely responsibile for your listing traffic. When you have a keyword in your title, description, or bullets you can “rank” for that keyword. This means that when a customer searches for a product using this keyword your Amazon page is more likely to show up in the results.
This is why it is so important to do the proper keyword research and inject these keywords into your listing.
What tools do you need to add the keywords into your listing?
In this process, we are going to show you how to use Cerebro, Magnet2, Frankenstein, and Scribbles to fully optimize your listing.
Overview of the process that this SOP will teach

Collect your ASIN and a root keyword
Use H10’s Cerebro for keyword mining
Use Cerebro to find key phrases
Use H10’s Magnet 2
Collect your possible search terms
Use H10’s Frankenstein to remove duplicate search terms
Use Scribbles to draft your content

Attached is the picture with a brand I have scored a exclusive contract with.
My question is that I need advice on how to answer to this email. I understand that less sellers are better for me and that it is easier to control the market price versus other sellers.
Please advise.
Thanks,
Phong","['This sounds too me like they don’t understand how Amazon works. There is no reason to have different sellers to cover different regions because Amazon will distribute the product to their warehouses across the country.\nIn addition, the number of sellers selling a brand is not important for marketing. It is in fact easier with one seller because you can trust all of your data more and do not have to coordinate with other sellers on campaigns.\nWhat I am much more concerned about is the opportunity. Are they asking you to invest $60,000 in a product that has never been on Amazon? It sounds like the brand is new to market and they have immediate sales expectations. There should be zero expectations. There can be no guarantee of success with a brand new product.\nIt also sounds like they have money problems which seems like a red flag to me.', 'Thank you for the response Keith,\nYou’re right about the Amazon distribution system if it was FBA. He is talking about FBM in this case. In 2018 there was approximately 37% of amazon users that do not have FBA and were buying FBM. I do not believe having more sellers using FBM in different locations would make too much of a difference, as long as there is the opportunity to buy FBM is there is what really matters in my opinion.\nI have already signed an exclusive contract and they have one product. I was inquiring about a future product that is adding value to the single product of theirs I’m selling now.\nWe’ll have a meeting by the end of August to see where we’re at and how to best improve the sales performance and value of the brand.']","Jul 26, 2019 1:31 pm",3,278,2
