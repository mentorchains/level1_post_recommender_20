Adding another seller prevents loss of sales and skyrocketing BSR in cases where the original seller\u2019s account is suspended or shut down.\nWhat are some other good reasons to having more than one Amazon seller?", "@Mitch spot on. For those of you like me that have no clue how cutthroat it is out there. This will wake you up a bit. 63", "@Dennis Ya that is a great article.  Thank you for that!", "Thanks Dennis, this article is very informative.", "\n\n\n Mitch:\n\nthe most effective ways to convince a brand\n\n\n@Mitch, I take a little issue with the framing of your question.  The whole art of selling it to not sell anything.  Here is what I mean.  If you listen to any of Trent\u2019s podcasts or watch any of his video\u2019s the key that most people miss when he talks about talking with brands is that he knows he has something the brand needs.  Most people approach brands in the totally opposite mind set.  (ie I need this brand for my business) When you have properly prepared for the call, researched their listings, researched their offline business, know your value proposition, etc you don\u2019t need to sell anything.  Your whole call is about sharing the research that you did on their business.  If a brand does not see your value when you share all this information with them, don;t waste your time \u201cconvincing\u201d them to do anything.  Once you convince them to do something once, you will have to continue to \u201cconvince\u201d them again and again and again\u2026", "@Dennis, great article. \nI remember read this in January.", "Good point @MattB.  I battle to frame this correctly based on how well the brand has optimized its distribution channels.  For well optimized brands, it can be tough to show exactly why the brand needs you but there are always areas that could be improved.  Either they will agree that improving in these areas are worth another seller or they won\u2019t.", "@Mitch if a brand is already optimized you will probably need to get real creative in order to show them you are different than the typical Amazon seller in order for them to be interested in you.  It depends on their size and current online presence.  You could see if they would be interested in having you manage their Amazon business in exchange for being a seller.  If you create enough value in their eyes they will work with you.\nAlso, one thing that I try to remember is no might mean not right now.  Come back to them in 3-6 months and see if anything has changed.", "I first will say that I have only been selling on AMZ since jan 1 2019.But have been in sales for 15 years.  I have spoken with many brand only listrs (i will call them)  Unless they are an APPLE or other high profile brand with a product that requires 100 % control of the distribution chain. (99% don\u2019t need 100% control)  These brands are just small minded.  Instead of having systems in place to police 1,2,3,10 good sellers.  They don\u2019t have systems to they just have BOB manage the amazon thing. (even if they do a good job).  They are small minded because if they thought like NIKE. Kellogg, Ridgid.  They would spend money, create systems and then just focus on making products and letting the sales to others.  (ie walmart)\nI say all that to say this.  The way that I have been able to get a few of these brands (even with my limited amz selling) is to let them bloody their nose, get 4 different kinds of dog pooh kicked out of them and when I do my (MILLION $$$$ WORD NEXT)   FOLLOWUP CALLS.  Be there to say, I told you so.  I am there to ask if they are ready to do it a bit more intelligently.\nWith ALL small minded people/companies the only thing that works is letting them fail until they learn the hard way.\nI guess this dissertation could be much shorter by saying.\nCall, Listen/pitch your idea.

How to start the call, what to say, questions to ask, etc\u2026\nMaking sure you are scheduling as many of these calls as you can (from the replies you receive) is absolutely critical to your success.

In these interviews, I learned a great deal about Google Tag Manager, why it is important, and how to use it, plus something called attributed revenue.\nWhy should you care about this stuff? Simple. The more you know about digital marketing, the better off you are when it comes to being able to have intelligent conversations with brands\u2026and the inevitable outcome of your making a very positive first impression on brands is that they will want to do business with you, if for no other reason than to get access to your brain.\nBe smart.

I strongly recommending you always seek independent legal and/or financial advice.\nI hope the following helps you better understand the issue so that you can gain a bit more clarity and decide how to move forward.\nI too am non US resident and I know exactly what you\u2019re talking about in this scenario.\nThis is one of the reasons I actually shut down my US single member LLC and established a company in my own country.\nAmazon\u2019s tax interview is setup correctly, and does ask the correct questions from a tax perspective.\nThe issue is however, their system drags across the single member details and uses that same information as the legal entity, thus why your personal name shows up as the legal entity inside of Seller Central.\nI escalated this issue on numerous occasions with Amazon and explained the issue even at their legal level, however, despite also having sought clarification through a US based tax attorney, Amazon still said it is setup correctly in their system.\nThere is no way around it as a single member LLC entity when you\u2019re an international non resident single member.\nThe biggest issue I could foresee with this is that your vendor issued invoices will always be in the name of the legal entity, your LLC, and so this will never match with Amazon\u2019s backend system.\nIf Amazon ever asks for invoices for verification, you\u2019ll very likely hit major issues, an unlikely be able to prove anything.\nOperating under wholesale business model using that legal structure is risky, especially with the level of frivolous IP and authenticity claims that occur on the platform now.\nYou\u2019ll also never be able to get ungated if requested to provide invoices because again, the entity details wont\u2019 match. I know this for sure because I experienced and lost money from it.\nAlso, be aware of the additional reporting requirements that the IRS now has in place for non resident LLCs.\nVery few people are aware of these new requirements until it is too late.\nThere are all very important considerations you should understand when deciding to continue operating as a US entity, and another reason why I would suggest you seek professional advice from someone who specialises in US tax law for NON US residents.\nI hope this helps.\nAll the best.", "Hey there,\nThanks very much for your very detailed reply, really appreciate it.\nYes those issues you mentioned i already came across (invoices with my LLC name) but i got around it by asking them to put my own name and address on it, which they were happy to do but that just sounds amateur to most suppliers i\u2019m sure.\nI\u2019ll be getting in touch with a professional as well as looking into a limited company in my own country.\nI assume you\u2019re operating under your company name in your home country, my i ask if your US suppliers have an issue with this?\nThanks very much again", "Hi,\nI\u2019m glad it helped.\nUnfortunately it\u2019s another one of the many challenges us internationals experience when starting out on the marketplace in the USA.\nYes I established a new company in my home country and then applied for an EIN, which you will need to sell on the marketplace, and yes, it is very easy to get via a phone call to the IRS.\nThen it\u2019s up to you whether you get a reseller certificate.\nYou don\u2019t need one, however you will find a LOT of brand owners who won\u2019t open an account unless you provide them with one, even when you clearly explain that you\u2019re an entity domiciled outside of the USA so legally don\u2019t need one as I was advised by a tax attorney.\nIt\u2019s more to remove that as an objection, but it does come with compliance requirements.\nOnce again, decide which way is right for you once you speak with a professional.\nHope this helps.", "Hi,\nI\u2019ll be investigating your way of doing things this weekend.\nThis information is a massive help, and once again, it\u2019s hugely appreciated!\nWish you all the best with your business\nP.S Anyone following this i\u2019ll update it if i have anything new to report about this issue", "Hi AnthonyD.\nVery useful advice, thanks for sharing.\nAre you able to share the details of the accountant you use please?
